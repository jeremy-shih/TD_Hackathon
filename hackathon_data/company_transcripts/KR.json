All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. ","Rebekah Manis","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. ","Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you. ","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.","We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan, Restock Kroger. ","All of this work starts with our customer obsession focus. That is why we're building an omni-channel platform to serve customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by exciting partnerships that create additional value. ","That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it is important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range. ","One of our most powerful competitive advantage is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3% and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands such as Private Selection led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. ","We know that our customers love our brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brand items.","Our customer's favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection Pork Belly Bites, Private Selection Artesian jerky, and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter. ","Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. ","Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pick-up or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pick-up or delivery services, or Ship. ","Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omni-channel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I call this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made. ","2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado, and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers anything, anytime, anywhere.","Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado.","Kroger's partnership with Ocado will for the first time introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This in turn means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America. ","We are also making progress building out our Alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on Alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. ","Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic to improve the customer experience which then supports new margin-rich asset-light businesses. We expect Alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature Alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our media businesses, and customer data insights.","There other initiatives within our Alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in, and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where Alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks. ","One of the challenges of transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotal next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. ","We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our New Business Development including partnerships and Kroger's Alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. ","Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed, and made in partnership with Kroger's board of directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new Senior Vice Presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward. ","Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social, and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger\/Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. ","As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phase-out of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. ","Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interests. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. ","Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. ","The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. ","As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments. ","Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who has been in the CFO role since April. Gary?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights, and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities, in-store, pick-up, delivery and Ship. ","As Rodney discussed, we had a few headwinds during the first quarter including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure, similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. ","I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan and Alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. ","On that note, last quarter we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our Alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect Alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements. ","Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification. ","Through the first quarter of 2019, Alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our media business and seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters. ","Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. ","We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. ","Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin excluding fuel decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. ","The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. ","OG&A cost as a rate of sales excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. ","Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. ","Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. ","Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. ","Turning now to talent development, we are supporting associates in a variety of ways including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer.","The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most stocks and associates will receive regular wage increases every six months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. ","We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after six months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. ","In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. ","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. ","Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. ","A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. ","We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt to EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YOU Technology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so. ","I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YOU Tech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. ","As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term services agreement with Inmar. YOU Tech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. ","Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include a liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. ","Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the gear. For 2019, identical sales growth excluding fuel, we continue to target identical sales that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share, and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. Rodney, back to you. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear-eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. ","Now we look forward to your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","Robbie Ohmes","Oh, thanks. Good morning, guys. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Good morning. ","Robbie Ohmes","Rodney, my question is could you talk a little bit about, now that you're a quarter into this year, how your price investment plan is trending? Is it more or less than what you were expecting? And maybe remind us what kind of price investment year 2019 is expected to be. And maybe weave that into how that plays out into the expectation for accelerating IDs. ","And then also maybe weave in just the environment you're seeing out there competitively. We're seeing signs of the promotional environment in produce being a little more aggressive than it's been in a while. If you could weave the picture together for us, that would be great. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Robbie. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. ","If you look at the 2019 investment, it would be a reasonable amount. It would not be as much as what we did in 2018 because as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our 2019 investments into 2018 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. ","When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes, and overall we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more, but when you look at it all-in-all, it looks pretty consistent with before. ","On accelerating the identicals, it really is \u2013 one of the things on space optimization now is becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been \u2013 has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. ","Robbie Ohmes","Terrific. Thanks so much. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Robbie. ","Operator","The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Judah Frommer","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just a follow-up on IDs. Can you help us with the cadence throughout the quarter? It sounded like when you gave the quarter-to-date update with fourth quarter earnings that you were running better than where you finished the quarter and obviously things are expected to accelerate. So beyond remodels, have there been enough contribution from the roll-out of online grocery and the impact of inflation relative to your expectations? ","W. Rodney McMullen","Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make \u2013 tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a lull, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything, but there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of \u2013 if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all of those things. ","As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind, but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth, and if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we\u2019re looking at the second quarter so far, it's only three weeks, but we are moving closer to the 2019 guidance. ","Gary Millerchip","Rodney, the only thing I would add \u2013 the question was asked around digital too as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. ","Judah Frommer","Okay. And if I could quickly follow up on media, it sounds like trends are going kind of in line with or above plan there. Clearly some of your big box competitors have made moves in the media space, sometimes acquiring external assets. Is that something you feel like you need to do? Does their leaning into these retailer-led platforms help your conversations with vendors, or does it serve as more competition? ","W. Rodney McMullen","For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand, and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer.","And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced for all of us to be successful just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. ","In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now, whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. ","Judah Frommer","Great. Thanks. ","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. ","Edward Kelly","Yeah, hi, guys. Just first, a clarification. The planned real estate transaction in the quarter, if I look at the cash flow statement there is about a $57 million gain. Is that the amount that we should be thinking about that contributed to the quarter? ","Gary Millerchip","Hi. Yes. This is Gary. That's right, Ed. As we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. ","So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often there can be some losses as well as a gain sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that one-time transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. ","Edward Kelly","Any other planned real estate transactions like this contemplated for the full year? ","Gary Millerchip","I think we're always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist. But they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, in the guidance. ","Edward Kelly","Rodney, my real question here is for you, and it's on the IDs. And bigger picture, you used to consistently outperform a broader peer set and industry data like Nielsen. And to me, one of the biggest issues right now with your company is that that actually no longer seems to be happening. Your IDs are just north of 1% this quarter, despite the fact that you have digital in there. Specialty is in there now. You are lapping some optimization. You invested a lot last year. ","I guess why do you think the share gains have slowed so much? And I know you're focused on improving momentum, but what specific adjustments are you making? ","W. Rodney McMullen","It really is for us to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. So part of the \u2013 and this is using the data that we track every week. How are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock, and all of those pieces, and the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. ","The other part is some of the things I mentioned before. It's just cycling, space optimization, and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing, and using the data in a continued sophisticated way but even growing upon that is what we've had in the past. ","Edward Kelly","All right. Thanks, guys. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Edward. ","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. ","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I actually wanted to touch on food inflation. Could you maybe give a little bit more granular in terms of what you're seeing currently and your expectations going forward? And then maybe you can talk about, are you seeing prices being passed through to the shelf at this point? ","W. Rodney McMullen","Sure, I'll be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we would see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%, that is what we built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. ","Certainly as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. ","One of the things we obviously feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through, and of course it's a great set of knowledge for us, knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increase. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. That's helpful. Oh, no. Keep going. ","W. Rodney McMullen","I was saying, I think our outlook for the year in general would be similar to what we've been experiencing except for of course some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously one or two items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. ","Yeah, and tariffs from China is a pretty minimal effect on us and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully something works out there. As you know, overall from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. That's great additional color. And then just quickly on gross margins, can you talk about the dynamics going on with pharmacy right now in the industry as relates to gross margin and how you're thinking about kind of those dynamics going forward? ","Gary Millerchip","Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context in pharmacy business too because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty with the customer and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly as we mentioned during the quarter, and it ties very closely to us to our health and wellness strategy and as we start to think about food as medicine we think it's a very important connection. ","The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play really within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1, which as I mentioned wouldn't be unique to us. ","The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore, the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PBM agreements, three of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in cost there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. ","That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that both from a how to do we buy most effectively but also how do create more efficiency in the pharmacy business, and we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our own brands and other things that I mentioned in total we still had great results. And also, as we move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an Alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life.","And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. ","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you so much. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. ","John Heinbockel","Hey, Rodney, can you address the topic of the organization's capacity for change, right. So you've got a lot of change going on. You've got people in new roles. Do you think that \u2013 all of that, other than maybe space optimization, is impacting execution in any way and it may be impacting your top-line growth? ","And then as you go forward, if there might be some of that, is there a way to sort of streamline things, prioritize so that maybe there is \u2013 you impact the organization's ability to manage that change better? Curious your thoughts on that. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Yeah, a great question, John, and it's something that we talk about obviously routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving Alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had \u2013 it's a huge opportunity, we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to \u2013 for us to ask ourselves, is it center of plate or corner of plate and if it's center, that's incredibly important. ","So I feel incredibly good about the people that we put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help supplement the internal talent we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents, and on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. ","So to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people enroll over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes and it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth. ","So it\u2019s making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. ","John Heinbockel","And then I know it's early, but what have you learned with the Walgreen test in Cincinnati, particularly as you kind of look forward to opening up the Ocado sheds in non-Kroger markets? Have you learned anything definitive, or not yet? ","W. Rodney McMullen","It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been an incredibly positive is Walgreens. Their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner, and both of us are learning things that customer likes and dislike together and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. ","And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. ","Gary Millerchip","Yeah, sure. I think some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky alongside 10 of our own stores with the pick-up service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're a different level of convenience than we were before and this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. ","We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight whether it's for lunch or dinner and that's certainly a real positive. ","What we find generally with the small format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with the shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small format stores and we\u2019ve seen that over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really pouring over the data and making sure that we're using a data driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. ","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John. ","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can you give us more clarity on how the past full year operating profit guidance works? Thus far, you're trending a little below your ID sales range, even currently in the current quarter.","It sounds like the pharmacy gross margin pressure has been greater than you expected and you got a real estate gain in the first quarter, yet your profits were still down. So what's the path that you could take from here to get to your operating profit guidance for the full year? And at what point do you see more risk that it would be harder to get to that level? ","W. Rodney McMullen","Yeah, I'll make a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the \u2013 if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the C-store business during the first quarter. And we sold YOU Tech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. ","And as I mentioned, the Alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. ","Gary Millerchip","Yeah, it's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney. So thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where Alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. ","I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and will continue to pull to give us the ability to make sure that we\u2019re continuing to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. ","So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customers and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model and we continue to find additional opportunities whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in resale and cost of goods. As so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020.","Michael Lasser","And then my follow-up question is on your price investment, recognizing that there\u2019s been a lot of noise in your IDs over the last couple of quarters, given the disruption from the store remodels. Do you think your price investments are as effective as they might have been in the past? And if they are, will you have to reaccelerate your price investments in the coming quarters to drive higher IDs from here? ","W. Rodney McMullen","One of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price. And we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they\u2019re looking at their price as well. ","When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what\u2019s the experience they get from associates, what\u2019s the freshness of the fresh department, and we continue to rate strong in terms of if you look at produce, meat, seafood, deli, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. ","And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then obviously fuel is an important part of that overall equation. ","So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at, as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. ","Michael Lasser","Thank you very much, and good luck. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Michael. ","Operator","The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Kelly Bania","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in here. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Kelly Bania","Had a \u2013 good morning. Had a couple questions on operating profit. I first wanted to ask just about your three-year plan. I didn\u2019t really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don\u2019t want to read too much into it, but can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you\u2019ve pointed out in the past, I think the Street is skeptical of getting to that, given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? ","And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill, and there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition, and now with this real estate transaction, that was $57 million I think. So that\u2019s about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren\u2019t aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? ","W. Rodney McMullen","Sure. Yeah, I think as you think about the Restock Kroger plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. ","I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we\u2019re feeling very good about the \u2013 what we\u2019ve learned through the process around where we unlock and you how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you\u2019ve heard us talk about, Alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be. If anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there.","As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying I would say more cost savings as we\u2019re working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there and becoming a more efficient operator. ","I do think as we\u2019ve shared all the way along and Rodney\u2019s been consistent in his comments that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That\u2019s an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we\u2019re committed to achieve in the second half is this year and obviously into 2020. ","So I think as you pull those three pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there and I would say in the levers that we intended to pull where we are in the journey with those levers, we\u2019re feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we\u2019re still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. ","Kelly Bania","And any comment on the Home Chef, Turkey Hill, the real estate, how those are part of the $400 million, the impact of those?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yeah, so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we\u2019re place lined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion in 2017, down to $3.5 billion. There may be a couple of \u2013 they\u2019re certainly not going to be drastic and material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that have happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. ","We certainly don\u2019t contemplate as we think about the run rate and the value that we\u2019ll be generating in 2020 the one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We\u2019re not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn\u2019t drive the value. ","But the Home Chef certainly isn\u2019t in the $400 million. And the Turkey Hill sale gain certainly isn\u2019t included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are. That\u2019s why we kind of stripped those out from the performance and what which shared is our progress in the year. None of those or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain and that would be if you like filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. ","Kelly Bania","Okay. Maybe just a couple follow-ups to that. I guess can you share with us where you see your FIFO operating profit with all the adjustments, these I guess five quarters through the plan?","And then in terms of Alternative profit, so I think you said in the past there was a 20% increase this year. Does that equate to the $100 million that you\u2019re now talking about, and can you remind us what the last year and next year is kind of planned at? ","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, on Alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was \u2013 last year was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at 2017, if I remember right, Gary, you\u2019ll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. ","So it\u2019s continuing to accelerate as we learn how to do it. And if you look at like the media business, we\u2019ve recruited professionals that know how to grow that business. So we\u2019re actually accelerating where we are. On the five quarters and stuff, I think we\u2019re probably \u2013 it would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up and make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help \u2013 be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. ","Kelly Bania","Thank you. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Chris Prykull","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Good morning. ","Chris Prykull","So I guess firstly on the composition of gross margin, the change year-over-year and maybe the cadence the rest of the year, a couple components to that. So how much of the 40 basis point nonfuel decline can be attributed to pharmacy? Should we expect a similar headwind for the rest of the year, or will that improve? You mentioned Alternative profits can be lumpy. Anything to keep in mind from a margin contribution seasonally? ","And then you\u2019re lapping some supply chain investments in the fourth quarter. I understand that. Any sense for mix shift towards Our Brands and the contribution there? ","W. Rodney McMullen","I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019ll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan, and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. ","If you look at Our Brands, I always tell people Our Brands margin typically is 600 basis points to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously it\u2019s a higher sales part and when you look at the gross margin per item, it\u2019s usually a penny or two higher on a cents per item profit basis. In terms of Rx in the balance of the year, Gary, I\u2019ll let you go into a little bit of the details there. ","Gary Millerchip","Yeah, so certainly as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned, and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth, those two combined would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. ","We\u2019re feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year, and as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don\u2019t expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. ","That being said, obviously we manage the business very dynamically. It\u2019s important that we\u2019re able to adapt on price and continue to invest were it makes sense and where the customers tell us they really value it and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. ","So we tend to really focus on how we\u2019re managing the business to make sure that we\u2019re achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we\u2019re finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce our cost saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And Alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of gift cards and the other related items. ","Operator","And that question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. And Mr. Cerankosky dropped his line. The next question will be from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Michael Montani","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the core gross margin for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments and the pharmacy, what are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend if you could. Thank you. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Yeah, if you look at on the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going, buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment, but as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things which funded quite a bit of investment as well. Gary, anything you want to add to that? ","Gary Millerchip","I think you said it well, Rodney. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Okay.","W. Rodney McMullen","Before we end today\u2019s call, one of the things that\u2019s exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how all of us live our purpose every day. ","As America\u2019s grocer, Kroger takes seriously our role in celebrating our uniquely American heritage during the patriotic season between Memorial Day and Independence Day. It always makes me feel incredibly proud that Kroger employs so many men and women who have served or currently serving the armed forces. ","I got a chance to personally live our purpose last Saturday with our Veterans Associate Resource Group who put on 5K run to raise money for veterans. While I certainly didn\u2019t finish first, and nowhere close to last either, I would like to add in the race, I did have a different kind of first. Touring a specifically designed tiny house that our caring associates dreamed up and then built for a deserving local veteran and his family.","The home was built to green technology standards, made from recycled materials, and features solar panels, demonstrating our associates\u2019 commitment to and passion for Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger\/Zero Waste social impact plan. In addition to the home, our Cincinnati Dayton division donated a Kroger gift card and a bag of Our Brands products to turn a new tiny house into a home, and it really felt great. ","One of the many ways Kroger shows our gratitude and appreciation to all of our service members and their family is through our long-standing commitment to the USO. Kroger is the single largest donor to the USO, contributing over $22 million over the past decade. In keeping with this commitment, we will be presenting the USO with a $1 million donation at a barbecue for the troops event we are hosting at Fort Stewart in July. It is our honor and privilege as America\u2019s grocer to serve America\u2019s heroes. ","Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.

We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Kroger had an outstanding fourth quarter and an outstanding year. We accomplished a lot in fiscal 2012. We delivered on ID sales growth, we exceeded expected earnings per share growth, we increased FIFO operating margin and we increased our dividend 30%. Kroger's unique value offering of better service, great products and enjoyable shopping experience and lower prices continues to resonate with a full range of customers. The result is an industry-leading 37 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales growth. In this morning's press release, we provided you with details to make it easier for you to do an apples-to-apples comparison and understand how we look at our business internally. Table 6 in our press release was designed to help you understand the details behind the growth figures we reported.","We delivered value to shareholders by increasing our dividend and exceeding our own earnings per share guidance through the combination of solid operating results and share buyback. We returned more than $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock buyback in 2012. Our associates delivered an outstanding year that underscores Kroger's growing connection with customers remains the key to shareholder value creation. In a moment, Rodney will outline how we got there, and Mike will discuss the numbers.","First, I'd like to give you some insight into what our customers are facing today. Consumer confidence was fragile throughout the year, and it hit its lowest point this January as customers voiced heightened concern over taxes. We believe 4 factors will continue to affect consumer confidence: the overall state of the economy, fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty. These factors are causing sales comparisons between days and weeks to be highly variable. But overall, we continue to have strong ID sales trends.","We remain confident in our ability to deliver growth despite the economic uncertainty. Our team has delivered strong results by executing our Customer 1st Strategy over the last 5 years. And as you know, the last 5 years has been highly volatile, and we have continued to consistently deliver through that time. A cornerstone of our Customer 1st Strategy is the value our associates deliver to our customers. Our customers are stressed at the pump, they look to our Fuel Points program for meaningful savings. And when families have less to spend in restaurants, our ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat meals help them eat well at home.","When you want convenience of finding everything you need plus a little in one place and save time at the checkout, nobody does it better than our family of stores. So whatever the economic and operating environment, Kroger is situated to deliver on our growth targets for 2013 and beyond. Our ability to do this is what makes Kroger a compelling investment.","Rodney will now provide deeper insight into our business performance and share our year-end market share statistics with you. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We are implementing our long-term growth strategy, which includes: targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging dunnhumby insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program.","We continue to make good progress, adding square footage in 4 fill-in markets, and we've identified others based on various metrics. We have narrowed the list of new markets for future expansions. In 2013, we plan to build, expand or relocate 45 to 50 supermarkets compared to 44 in fiscal 2012.","At our Investors Meeting in October, we identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our success. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results of each metric. On identical sales, we are very pleased with our fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3% without fuel. We focus on identical sales because it provides the strongest measure of our relevance with customers over time. Our identical sales without fuel and pharmacy were consistent throughout the year. We are very pleased with our identical sales trends through the year, given the fact that inflation declined during the year and tonnage growth improved throughout the year.","Consistent with our guidance at the start of 2012, pharmacy sales benefited overall sales in the first half of the year. This was due to strong growth in our pharmacy business, including attracting and retaining Express Scripts business. As also in line with our guidance at the start of the year, identical sales trended down as prescription drugs came off patent. These events will be important to keep in mind as you estimate our quarterly sales expectations for 2013. Mike will provide our guidance shortly.","Rolling 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 6 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2011 result. This is in line with our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on our rolling 4-quarters basis. The third target metric is return on invested capital, or ROIC. ROIC in the fourth quarter held steady at 13.4%, the same as last year. We are committed to growing our ROIC over time, even with the higher level of capital spending. Our fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money.","According to Nielsen Homescan data, Kroger's overall dollar share of products we sell in markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points during fiscal 2012. The pace of our market share growth accelerated in the back half of the year. This mirrors our tonnage growth during the year.  This data also indicates that our share increased in 10 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report and declined in 9 areas. Walmart Supercenters, our primary competitor in 17 of the 19 marketing areas, outlined by the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased to 9 of those 17 markets and declined in 8 markets, and overall market share slightly increased. This Nielsen Homescan Data is generated by customers who self-report their grocery purchases to Nielsen. This includes all retail outlets that sell the same products that we sell.","Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses for our eighth consecutive year. In fiscal 2012, OG&A plus cost plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 48 basis points as a percent of sales. Sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by an increase in visits per household, loyal household growth and slight increases in units per basket and per month. As a result, total units sold were up solidly compared to last year as I mentioned before.","For the full year, customer visits and monthly purchases were up, while items purchased each trip were down. The number of loyal households continued to increase, as did the number of loyal household store visits. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation declined to 1.7% excluding fuel. Once again, every store department had inflation with the exception of seafood, which had deflation.","Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of grocery department sales dollars in the fourth quarter, and grocery department corporate brands units sold were 33.5%. The mix between national brands and corporate brands fluctuates in any given quarter. Our goal is to give the best value to our customers, and we continue to be a market leader in corporate brands. Corporate brands introduced 588 new items in the grocery department in 2012. Many of these were sold under our new Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands, which had fiscal 2012 sales that exceeded our internal goal by 33%. Obviously, this has been a huge home run.","We plan to continue developing innovative products that solve for unmet needs and that our customers won't find anywhere else in 2013. Our practice has been to disclose our corporate brands' share in grocery category only. The reason for not using a broader base was the introduction of new items in categories where we previously had not been broadly represented. We felt this would have portrayed our growth in a too-favorable light. With this behind us, we plan to begin giving a view of our share across a broader portion of the store in future quarters.","As you know, our commitment to improving the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, our people, products, prices and shopping experience, sets us apart from many of our other food retailers. While many of our competitors do well in one or more of these areas, very, very few excel in all 4 of them. I'd like to share a couple of examples how we are seeking to improve our connection to customers through the non-price key of our Customer 1st Strategy.","An important area of focus for us is improving our digital connection with customers through our mobile phone app and on the web at kroger.com. We offer Kroger customers the ability to check their fuel points, download coupons instantly to their shopper cart, create a shopping list and order pharmacy prescription refills virtually wherever they are. We know that customers who are digitally engaged with Kroger are more loyal than those customers who aren't, which is why we recently began promoting our digital offering to connect with more customers on our digital platforms. In a short period of time, we've seen visits to our mobile app increase by more than 120% and a 45% increase in traffic to kroger.com and growth in the number of customers who have signed up for online and mobile accounts with Kroger.","Another measure of our growing digital connection is the total number of digital coupons that have been downloaded. In December, we hit a milestone of more than 500 million digital coupons downloaded by our customers. We see only opportunity by improving our offering in the digital arena, particularly as we leverage our world-class loyalty program with dunnhumbyUSA.","Our customers are also eating more seafood as part of their weekly diet, making seafood one of the fastest-growing commodities we sell. To meet this growing demand today and in the future, we support both wild-caught and farm-raised fishery improvement projects around the world so customers can know with confidence that the seafood they buy at Kroger is always fresh, high quality and sustainably sourced. Just last month, we helped launch the Global Sustainable Seafood Initiative, or GSSI, to ensure that certification programs continue to successfully evaluate and validate our suppliers' best-in-class sustainability efforts. Kroger is proud to be the only U.S.-based retailer to hold a seat on the GSSI steering board, and we are also a founding member.","Finally, I'd like to give you an update on labor relations. Our associates play a big part in building customer loyalty. Kroger's commitment to our associates include our dedication to safety, significant investments in training, solid wages and good quality, affordable health care. We have to deliver on this in ways that allow us to operate competitively with the non-union retailers in each of the markets that we serve. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective. Growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We were pleased that our associates ratified a series of new labor agreements covering stores in Portland and throughout Oregon and Southwest Washington. Currently, negotiations are underway with the UFCW for store associates in the Indianapolis area. In 2013, we have labor contracts expiring in Michigan, Houston, Dallas, Cincinnati and Seattle.","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's 2012 financial results and our guidance for 2013. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Obviously, our numbers are a little difficult to dissect this quarter. As I go through our results, there are 3 important comparisons that we want to make sure you understand: first, how we performed compared to our guidance in 2012; second, how we compare our fiscal 2012 results to fiscal 2011; and third, to show you how we calculated our growth rate for 2013.","Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $461.5 million, or $0.88 per diluted share. LIFO was $0.09 per diluted share lower than estimated, and a discrete tax item added $0.02 per diluted share to the results for the quarter. These 2 items were not contemplated in our guidance. Excluding the benefit of these items, we exceeded earnings per diluted share expectations by $0.07.","Comparing our fourth quarter results to the prior year, net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter grew 22%. To calculate this, we excluded the extra week from the fourth quarter of 2012 and adjusted fourth quarter 2011 for the UFCW pension plan consolidation charge and to make LIFO comparable between the 2 quarters. This is illustrated in Table 6 of our press release.","We recorded a $41.2 million LIFO credit during the quarter compared to a $73.4 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We reminded you in the third quarter that we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge, and many of the items we discuss are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for any given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. If LIFO is lower than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be higher than our targets. And if LIFO is higher than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be lower than our targets. This is why we excluded the benefit of our lower-than-expected LIFO charge when comparing to guidance and calculating growth rates.","FIFO gross margin excluded retail fuel operations and the extra week decreased 43 basis points from the same period last year. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the extra week, declined 70 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.","Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2012 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that over time is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.127 compared to $0.121 in the same quarter last year after adjusting 2,000 -- after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.139 compared to $0.138 after adjusting for an additional week.","Turning now to Kroger's full year 2012 results. For the full year 2012, total sales increased $96.8 billion or -- to $96.8 billion, or 7.1% compared with the prior fiscal year. After adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2012, total sales increased to $94.8 billion, or 4.9% compared with the prior fiscal year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6% over that same time period. And further adjusting for the extra week, total sales excluding fuel increased 4%. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.5% in fiscal 2012 compared with the prior year.","Net earnings for fiscal year 2012 totaled $1.5 billion, or $2.77 per diluted share. These results include LIFO being lower than our guidance by $0.08 per diluted share and the discrete tax item that added $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and the $0.14 per diluted share effect from the credit card settlement and a reduction in the UFCW pension accrual in the third quarter. Collectively, these totaled $0.24 per diluted share and were not contemplated in our guidance of $2.44 to $2.46 per diluted share.","So comparing our performance without these items to guidance, we exceeded the high end of our range by $0.07 per diluted share. Comparing our 2012 results to the prior year, net earnings per diluted share in 2012 grew 16%. In order to calculate this, we believe adjustments to 2012 and 2011 are required. Adjustments for 2012 included the benefits gained from the pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter and excluding the extra week. In 2011, adjustments included the UFC pension plan consolidation charge in the fourth quarter and making LIFO comparable to 2012. This calculation is illustrated in Table 6 of our press release. The fact that we beat our own earnings guidance for the year even after raising it upwards several times throughout the year demonstrates the underlying strength of our core business and the bit of our -- benefit of our share buybacks to increase shareholder value.","Kroger recorded a full year LIFO charge of approximately $55 million. The company's fiscal 2011 full year LIFO charge was $216 million. As Dave and Rodney said earlier, we expect -- currently expect a slightly expanded FIFO operating margin on a rolling 4-quarters basis. On this basis, FIFO operating margin excluding fuel and the extra week increased by 6 basis points. This also excludes the benefits of the credit card settlement and the reduction in UFC pension accrual, both of which incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. We are pleased that we were able to deliver on our commitment, and it remains our goal to continue to slightly improve Kroger's non-fuel operating margin rate over time.","For 2013, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged. We're going to fund capital investments, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. Capital investments, excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2 billion for the year compared to $1.9 billion in 2011. For 2013, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range for the year.","During the fourth quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.2 million common shares for an investment of $57 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has $466 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012. Net total debt was $8.6 billion, an increase of $470.6 million from a year ago. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.04 compared to 2 during the same period last year. Our objective is maintain our current debt rating, and we believe a net total debt to EBITDA ratio of 2x to 2.2x will support this objective.","Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2013. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2013. We expect identical sales to trend up during the year as we lap higher inflation early in the year and the effect of generics in the second half of the year.","Full year net earnings for fiscal 2013 are expected to range from $2.71 to $2.79 per diluted share. This equates to the company's long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% from the adjusted fiscal 2012 earnings per diluted share of $2.52, as shown in Table 6 of our press release. To calculate our base, we excluded the benefits gained from the pension accrual and credit card settlement in the third quarter and the extra week, and we also normalized LIFO.","Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend of 2% to 2.5% for a total shareholder return of approximately 10% to 13.5%. When looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the following: the low end of our growth rate -- we expect quarter 1 to be at the low end of our growth rate, inflation is expected to be lower in the first quarter of 2013, and the growth of our pharmacy business won't be as substantial as last year's first quarter. We expect the second and third quarters to be at the high end to above our growth rate expectations as inflation is expected to become more comparable between the years, and we expect our ID sales to be trending up. For the fourth quarter, we expect lower than the prior year on a 12-week to 12-week basis, due primarily to a budgeted LIFO charge of $13 million versus a credit of $41 million for the fourth quarter of 2012.","We expect our full year LIFO charge to be approximately $55 million for 2013. This is the same as our LIFO charge for fiscal 2012. Where it ultimately ends up could be one of the factors that will determine where we land in the $2.71 to $2.79 EPS range. A higher LIFO charge would move us down in the range and a lower LIFO charge would move us up in the range.","As I said earlier, we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2013, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to fiscal 2012 results. This morning, we filed an 8-K summarizing the guidance and financial strategy that I just discussed and some additional items including pension contributions and expense and our tax rate expectations.","Now I will turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Mike. And as you can tell, we're very pleased with our financial results for the quarter and the year. Kroger's performance is the result of our associates' hard work and commitment to make each day better for our customers. We grew our business in 2012. And building on that momentum, we expect to deliver the growth in 2013 that we outlined at our investor meeting in October.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I remember at the Analyst Day, you had referenced the incremental CapEx would be a pressure to your SG&A in the near term, yet you still held that 8% to 11% range. Is there something as you look out to 2013 that gives you greater confidence than the long-term range and maybe if you can just give us a little more color?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, the increased capital, it'll have an effect on holding down our ROIC ability to grow that in the short term. We do expect to continue to not have that go down but, as Rodney said, grow it in the near term. As we open the stores, if you look at our guidance, we opened up 44 stores in 2012 and we're projecting 45 to 50 in 2013. So that's not a dramatic increase year-on-year that would have any kind of material effect on -- or from a preopening cost standpoint or the ramp-up of those new stores.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then one other quick detail. On the pharmacy business, how should we be thinking about the generic shift impact in the quarter? And I know you referenced that it'll be a little bit less next year, but maybe if you can help us quantify that?","David B. Dillon","Let me make a comment first and then I'll ask Rodney to answer the specific question. But I wanted to make the broad observation that our pharmacy business this past year was outstanding. And I want to make sure that anybody who's touched our pharmacy business in our organization knows how we feel about that. We were absolutely thrilled. So Rodney, you want to comment about the generic effect?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. The generic effect kept getting bigger and bigger as we went through the year, and we're just now starting to cycle the beginning parts of that. So the heavy -- the largest effect will be in the first and second quarters. It'll get a little smaller in the third and fourth, but not tremendously smaller. And we also obviously have a few more drugs going to generic. So we believe it will be a headwind from a sales standpoint throughout the year. One of the things that's very positive, as Dave mentioned, we had a great year on pharmacy. And so far this year, we've continued to have a strong script count growth in pharmacy as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Wanted to ask you, Dave, when you mentioned the variability in sales, I'm not surprised to hear that given all that's going on in the macro environment. But has that increased a lot compare -- I think you had mentioned it last quarter, too, and I asked you about it. But is that something that's -- the amplitude, the amount of variability is increasing. Or is that something to call out that we should think about?","David B. Dillon","I think we've seen it more amplified in the last 6 months or so than it had been, and that's why I called it out last quarter. And I think what we saw this last quarter was much of the same. Now last year was also hampered by the fact that there was a 2-day swing in the calendar because of leap day a year ago and when you come to the first of month or end of the month. And we've now rounded that, so we don't have that issue to contend with. But the issues that I was referring to really is the fragile nature of the consumer, and I think that they ended up swinging with -- almost with that day's news. Now that may be a little bit of an exaggeration, but you can see, as we do our polling, you can see heightened awareness. In January, for instance, on taxes -- I mean, that just shows crystal clear that it was on their minds. And I think it's things like that, that caused them to have that swing in how they approach their own daily living.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So that polling information, that's correlating somewhat with sale -- behavior and people...","David B. Dillon","Well, actually, we're calling out specifically in this case because sometimes, we can see behavior in sales as we did actually see it a couple years ago when the debt ceiling was been debated. But this time, when you look at the payroll tax, lots was written about the payroll tax, and lots of people were assuming. Of course, it's early in that process, so I don't know that we'll feel differently -- could feel differently down the road. But right now, what we see is taxes and the payroll tax and other issues like that on people's minds in a very noticeable way, and we see the variability from day to day, week to week. But we do not see what we think is a dollar sales impact in total on what's happening from the payroll tax.","J. Michael Schlotman","The other thing on top of that is, in some states, government transfer payments, the way those payments are made, have changed, and we haven't yet cycled a year with the new schedule on transfer payments being made to recipients. So that creates some of the volatility as well.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. One follow-up then I'll cede because of your one-question rule. Did the delay in tax payments, do you think that also affected the cadence and the variability in the sales results?","David B. Dillon","It certainly could have. It wasn't a big enough factor that we would be able to -- that we were able to discern it specifically in our minds. But it's one of the factors that I think we would list, and it's what was going on in the consumer's world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Mark Wiltamuth. We saw a number of other retailers show some holiday cautiousness on the part of consumers. Did you see any of that across the demographic cuts that you do as you look at your data?","David B. Dillon","Well, of course there were some signs of caution. But on the other hand, actually, we were pleased with our holiday selling period and the weeks that followed, actually, too. So I would say nothing that should be called out at this point. Rodney, you want to add anything to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No.","David B. Dillon","No.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And Mike, if you could maybe quantify your health care and pension headwinds because you still have a strong earnings growth story here, but it sounds like there are some headwinds we just can't see behind the scenes.","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, health care and pension headwinds are always out there. We -- in the 8-K, we filed what we expect our contributions to the union funds to be for pensions, and that dollar for dollar is an expense item. Whatever we contribute is an expense. The other item that's out there is the amount of expense we expect for the company-sponsored pension plan. And that's actually a little lower next year than we would have originally expected. But those items are always out there. It's one of the reasons why our identical sales performance is so important. And our goal is to be able to grow identical sales faster than our underlying costs are going so we can make the operating profit margin growth be what we expect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ajay Jain from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Maybe I'll address this to Mike Schlotman. I noticed your D&A was lower compared to last year, and I think it was down more materially if you account for the calendar shift. So just wondering, is there any change in your schedule? Can you just talk about what's driving that decrease? And what's implicit in your 2013 guidance for D&A expense?","J. Michael Schlotman","I wouldn't say there's anything specific that winds up being in there. Some of it's just reflective of some older stuff becoming fully depreciated. As you know, when you look at our CapEx, keep in mind not everything we spend capital on gets depreciated because we like owning our properties. So therefore, we buy the land, and that doesn't wind up in depreciation. So it doesn't affect that. We would expect the depreciation to be up a little bit in 2013 compared to 2012 on an apples-to-apples basis.","Ajay Jain - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up, maybe you guys mentioned it earlier and I might have missed it, but I just wanted to ask if you could comment on the intra-quarter ID trends?","David B. Dillon","Yes. The ID trends grew. By the 13th period, they were the strongest of the quarter, which is our last period of that quarter. And in fact, you didn't ask about it, but I'll add the additional 4 quarter -- or 4 weeks, rather, 4.5 weeks that we've had since that time. If you take the 13th period and the 4.5 weeks since that time, they both were about the same, and they both exceeded actually slightly above what our sales range guidance is for the year 2013. So we're pleased with that. We did have some weather in the last few weeks that has positively helped our sales. But even if you take that out, I think we were solidly -- certainly above the midpoint of what the guidance is that we gave.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to drill down a little bit on sort of the market share performance. So if I'm right, the share gains have moderated a little bit, say, from '11 and '10. Is that just because the prior gains were unsustainable and where we are now is more sustainable? Or I don't know how you've dove into that and taken a look at that. And then as part of that, if you then looked at loyal households, you looked at different customer groups and\/or different competitors, is there something where, as you dice it, the market share gains are actually stronger or accelerating with certain customers and again, certain competitors?","David B. Dillon","Let me take a shot at the market share question, and then I'll see if Rodney wants to bring that and the loyal households together. But on the market share, I would encourage you not to think of it as an accounting number and with precision. I would think of it as more a directional picture. It's a very helpful indicator of where things are headed, but I think it's more important really to look at it in combination with other things. So the first thing we noted on our market share was that it has been growing in the second half of the year so that you can assume that  the comparison for the year, that we're -- we may have had -- we had some -- we did have. In fact, we talked about some of the struggles we had with tonnage early last year, and that's changed. Our tonnage through the last half of this past year was strong. And in fact, as I indicated on the sales so far in the 4.5 weeks we've had it in this quarter, our tonnage continued strong, too. So if you combine the sales trends we've experienced, the tonnage we have experienced with what the ACNielsen material shows us, it's certainly directionally strong. Yes, it may be a little bit less than what it had been, but I don't -- in terms of market share. But I don't think it's a meaningful variance. I don't think that the numbers are that accurate that we can see that kind of variance in them. Rodney, you may want to add to that, and feel free to comment on the households.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. I would -- I agree completely. And as Dave and I both mentioned, and I mentioned earlier, we've improved during the year. So actually, the last half of the year, the gains were better than the overall year. When you look at customer segments, the value customer early in the year, we were very soft on share with that type of customer, and it's improved nicely. But that would have been the -- earlier in the year, that would have been a very soft area of our share by segment. If you look at more a traditional and upscale customer, those customer gains were really, across the year, and continue to be very nice.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And when you guys look at -- to Dave's point, you think it's -- share and comp together is probably a good matrix to use. And the levels we're at today, you're comfortable with. I would also think as the capital program picks up, share will pick up. Maybe there's some cannibalization, but share should pick up as you roll out more stores, correct?","David B. Dillon","I would agree with all of that. I would add to the metric. I would add tonnage, too. So I'd look at ID sales, tonnage and then what the ACNielsen material shows. And I'd look for the intersection of what those 3 things together are telling us. That's how we look at it.","W. Rodney McMullen","And there's not one single number that gives you all the answers, and that's one of the things that your comment really highlights, is you really need to look across more than one to get a feel overall. But at the end of the day, we felt very good about the progress we made on share gain last year in all markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would like to actually talk a little bit more about tonnage. I thought there were comments that you were making last year that the tonnage weakness was, to some extent, a result of high inflation at the beginning of the year. And then produce was deflationary, so you started to see some tonnage improvement. Is it fair to think about it in that sort of broad sense about the consumer and pricing? Or do think that whatever happens with tonnage is just based on what you guys do?","David B. Dillon","Meredith, I think it's actually both, personally. We were -- I think we admitted a little surprise in how quickly tonnage returned when inflation subsided. I thought it would take longer than it did. And so obviously, that has -- it has something to do with the fact that inflation subsided. But I also would like to think that we positioned ourselves really well to take advantage of that situation by the investments we've made in price and with the improvements that we continue to make in the other 3 keys in our stores. So I really think it ends up being both.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I wanted to -- you had great success in terms of controlling expenses in the fourth quarter, and congratulations on that. I know there's always a whole lot of different things you're working on, but is there anything that particularly stood out in the fourth quarter? And did the extra week, which we had guessed would benefit $0.07, and it benefited by $0.11, did the extra week contribute particularly much to that improvement in SG&A -- or OG&A?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. Thanks, Meredith, for the comment. And on the OG&A improvement that I mentioned on the call, it was adjusted for the extra week so we did not get any benefit in the number that I shared. In terms of specifics to call out, it was really broad based. It's almost every division of the company, and it's really core operations. Obviously, having good tonnage growth and identical sales gives you some tailwind, so we had that across the whole company, which was helpful, but just very good execution on our strategy and the things that we've identified. I wouldn't highlight one, Mike or Dave. I...","W. Rodney McMullen","No, I agree with you. It's actually refreshing that there's not one to highlight. That means there's a lot of things contributed to it, and the fact that it's broad based can make it sustainable.","David B. Dillon","And I do tend to look at that number over a longer period. One quarter is good. The number Rodney used in his -- in the prepared comments was the full year number, and I think that's a better reflection of how we did. Now that's still pretty darn good. But I tend to look over a long haul because the longer the period, the more likely that what you did is sustainable. And the things we did were really process-oriented. And changes that our customers actually either prefer or don't notice, either one.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then my final question would just be about labor, and maybe you could talk about -- you don't have to talk about any individual contract, but in terms of generally the negotiation, are you able to stick with kind of the total numbers you want to get in terms of labor cost increases, balancing the health care, pension and wages?","David B. Dillon","Well, there's 2 balances we actually -- probably more that we try to make each time. First -- or probably second is the one you mentioned, is balancing the health care costs, pension costs and so forth, and those are going to continue to be issues that need to be addressed. But the first balance that we actually try to address is on one hand, we do have the natural tension of wanting and needing to keep our expenses down low as a company. On the other hand, we genuinely want our associates to be fairly paid, certainly paid based on what the market rates are and so forth. We have a workforce that we've very proud of, and we don't look at this as something that is some opposition argument. We're trying to actually work on their side on this argument. We're trying to find a way to balance the business needs with what our associates need. So that's how we think of the labor. Now, Rodney, you may have some specifics.","W. Rodney McMullen","No.","David B. Dillon","That's it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise from USB (sic) [UBS].","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Jason DeRise at UBS. I wanted to ask a question on guidance, and I guess it's multipart and so I'm going to put them all together, and then what you're able to share will be great in terms of the color. So obviously, we have the square footage piece of that, but it's not a net. So I'm wondering if you can share what you're planning in terms of closures. Obviously, you're not going to be able to share what acquisitions you're planning on doing, unless you want to. Feel free to. And then in terms of the FIFO x-fuel gross margin, if you can share some thoughts on what you think between the gross margin element and the SG&A leverage? And then I guess the other ones that aren't mentioned directly but are going to be important in understanding this is the fuel contribution expected and the buybacks expected. So basically, the question is asking for more color on the guidance.","J. Michael Schlotman","The square footage at this point in time, we always give what we expect gross square footage to do. Our model is not built needing any acquisitions to make our numbers, so that's why we always say excluding acquisitions. If there were something out there that worked, it would be something that's additive to our results because we don't need to do anything to have -- to reach our growth expectations. Relative to the closures, while there are certainly a handful that are out there, that's something that occurs throughout the year as we constantly look at our portfolio of assets and look at what stores may need to close. I don't have a specific number for that at this point that we would -- that I would be willing to disclose. Relative to...","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can I ask if it would be a -- we would expect a net positive number? Because I mean I guess, last year, there was a positive gross number out there, but it...","J. Michael Schlotman","It's been a net positive for the last several years. Sometimes, what happens is we -- there have been occasions where we've closed a couple smaller stores and opened up one bigger store. And it looks like our store count goes down, but that bigger store is actually more square footage than the 2 stores we closed on a combined basis. So that certainly helps. When you look at the FIFO fuel gross margin and without fuel gross margin and SG&A leverage, we don't give specific guidance on those line items. We always expect to get SG&A savings that we'll invest back on our 4 keys, whatever line that key might fall in the income statement. And our overall goal was to grow our operating margin for the year slightly from the prior year, and that would remain our goal for this year. And relative to fuel contribution, I would say, typically, when we go into a year and when you, for instance, when you look at the fourth quarter of the year, it was only $0.01 difference without the extra week between the 2 years' fourth quarters. So the growth in that is not something that's a huge driver of the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth rate.","W. Rodney McMullen","Usually, we just use what, Mike, a 3-year rolling average in terms of the actual results and use that as a base point.","J. Michael Schlotman","Right. Look at gross margin per gallon over the last 3 years, and that's about where we start.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All of that's useful. I guess, in terms -- just to follow-up on the gross margin element. Within this last quarter that you talked about, I guess it's your inflation cost that you're talking about at 1.7%, but your large national competitor was talking about how their basket inflation was 0.8%. So I mean, if you're passing through that, most of that 1.7%, there's a gap there. I know a lot of people in the market are trying to interpret how the new 8% to 11% guidance -- what that means in terms of your aggressiveness in price or if you're pulling back. So if you can share some thoughts on that, if maybe your pricing isn't as aggressive in the quarter as it has been relative to your competition?","W. Rodney McMullen","It's really a little bit of apples and oranges. What we measure is our estimated inflation based on using government statistics on inflation by category at the mix of business we have. If you look at the actual basket that customers are buying from us, it would have a completely different inflation rate, and it would actually be meaningfully less, especially if the customer has pharmacy in their basket, it's substantially less. So it's -- those 2 are really apples and oranges. And what we try to give on an inflation rate is more based on our sales mix and some of the government statistics out there.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you feel that you maintained or improved your price position during the quarter?","W. Rodney McMullen","Our internal measures would all show that we've improved our relative price position versus all our major competitors, not just the one that you mentioned.","David B. Dillon","And we have no expectation that, that will change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short of firm BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Back on the inflation and the LIFO for a minute. When you guys gave your guidance for the LIFO charge for the full year in your third quarter call, it seemed like you kind of expected inflation to come in where it came in for the year. So I guess I'm confused about the credit this quarter. And then looking to next year, I guess what are your expectations on inflation for next year? Because given the LIFO charge for this year, just kind of going back to your P&L in prior years, it would look like you're kind of expecting like 1-ish percent.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. In the -- at the end of the third quarter when we gave our expectation for LIFO, our expectation at that time was that our full year LIFO charge would be $125 million. So through 10 periods, we had expensed enough to have 10\/13 of $125 million behind us. So when the year wound up at only $55 million by the time we got to the end of the year, we had almost $95 million, a little over $95 million accrued. So we had to reduce that number down to the $55 million, which led to the credit in the fourth quarter. That make sense?","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then for next year, your inflation expectations?","J. Michael Schlotman","Relative to next year, at this point in time, we're estimating LIFO to be at $55 million for next year, just like this year. As we sit here today, with inflation in the 1 percentage kind of range, maybe a little over, depending how pharmacy winds up affecting that, we think that's the best guess at this time. The other thing to keep in mind is inflation throughout the year has no effect on LIFO. So the fact that last year was very high early in the year and then it trended down throughout the year doesn't really affect LIFO. It is a single day point in time calculation of how many products do I have this year, what was last year's price and this year's price on that particular day. Now that's a little bit of a Reader's Digest version of how the calculation works, but it gets you close.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then wondering if you'd be prepared to give CapEx allocation for next year?","J. Michael Schlotman","You mean how much capital investment we plan to make? Or...","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, the allocation in -- I mean, you gave the dollars in your 8-K, but wondering if you could give the allocation?","J. Michael Schlotman","You mean allocation by what we're sort of spending on stores and things like that?","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Category. Yes.","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, I wouldn't get into the exact dollar amount of allocation, but we also gave guidance that we expect to do one -- a few more stores, new relocate and expands in 2013 compared to 2012 and probably a comparable number of remodels.","W. Rodney McMullen","Most of the dollar increase would be driven by the store-in program that we've outlined incrementally.","J. Michael Schlotman","And the other thing to keep in mind is as we're increasing our capital spend to focus on existing and some new fill-in markets as well as exploring new markets, it takes a while for those stores to open. So we'll be spending dollars in 2013 that wind up being 2014 store openings. So the growth in that store count takes a while because the spending happens so far in advance of that. So it'll be a slow growth or a slow build into the higher store count.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a last question, maybe if you could give some color on both the competitive and the acquisition environment? It seems like, on the acquisition side, there may be some assets coming up or presenting themselves shortly? And then comments on the competitive environment?","David B. Dillon","Well, on the acquisition environment, I would just give you the comments we've made before. We don't generally comment. What we've tried to do is share with you our philosophy how we approach that, and that really hasn't changed at all from the past. As to the competitive environment, I would characterize it as we have recently, it's still a hotly contested market, a very competitive kind of a business. That's the nature of our business. But I see people making rational choices. I don't see it as performing irrationally, which is a good thing in our minds and, I presume, in yours too. Rodney, anything else you want to add to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No. No. No.","David B. Dillon","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I was hoping we could dig into the gross margin, the FIFO gross margin a little bit this quarter. It was a little bit lighter than what I thought it was going to be. And I think if you were to look at it and remove the generic benefit, my guess, and this is where I'm hoping you could help, but my guess is the selling gross margin this quarter is probably weaker than what we've seen otherwise this year. So could you maybe just give us some more detail on selling, what's going on, on the shrink side, maybe the non-selling side and how this -- how the margin played out versus what you were expecting?","W. Rodney McMullen","It really played out very close to what we were expecting. And as you know, one of the things that we always work on is making sure we balance with our expense improvements. And any given quarter, you can't always get a balance perfectly. But for the year, we work really hard to get those 2 balanced. And it's driven as much by balancing those 2 pieces. If you look at it versus what we were expecting, it was very close to what we were expecting. Obviously, the generics improved gross margin, selling gross margins for the quarter. But overall, we were pleased with where it ended up and felt good about the balance. And we felt good about our relative price position in the market from a competitive standpoint.","J. Michael Schlotman","Rodney, I agree. And when you look at operating profit margin, which is what we always focus on, the fact we grew it by 6 basis points when really through 3 quarters year-to-date we were slightly negative, demonstrates the strong cost control. And the fact that we really -- as Rodney said, our -- we executed the plan we had, and it came to fruition in the fourth quarter because a lot of what occurred was somewhat planned. It was planned. So...","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And on the repo front, share repurchase, how should we think about '13? I mean, it's obvious that you're not probably going to buy back nearly as much stock this upcoming year as you did in the past. Will you still be borrowing to maintain a leverage ratio and then using that to buy stock?","W. Rodney McMullen","Again, the use of our cash flow, including maintaining our net total debt to EBITDA ratio in our 2x to 2.2x range, will really be used for all 4 of the things we laid out, and that's to fund our capital investments; to repurchase shares; maintain and hopefully, over time, grow our dividend; as well as maintaining our current credit rating. So we'll balance all of those needs. Relative to the stock share buyback, we would expect to continue to buy in shares. We obviously didn't buy as much in the fourth quarter as we had throughout the course of the year. That was not any kind of a statement on where our share price was in the fourth quarter relative to the rest of the year. It was really based on the fact that we were cognizant of where our debt levels were going into the fourth quarter, and the fact of the way the rating agencies look at our debt level, things like our $250 million contribution to our EBIT [ph] at the end of the year, it's a very smart thing to do from a tax standpoint because we accelerate the tax deduction. But even though that burns off in the first few months of the next fiscal year, they treat it as debt at the end of the year. So I would have -- it made great return sense to make that contribution and get the tax deduction this year versus next year and balance that with how much free cash flow that leaves me to buy in shares. So we try to balance all of our needs on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could go back to some comments you made a little earlier about the value and the traditional and upscale consumers and how the value kind of improves through the year. I was wondering, one, what do you think has driven that? Have you been catering to that a little bit better as we move through the year? And two, how do you think the volatility -- the mild volatility that you saw in January, how did that impact those different customer segments?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, in terms of -- it would definitely have been targeted things that we did looking at the customer. It's one of the things that's such a wonderful benefit of our partnership with dunnhumby. That example was on a value customer, but we'd really look at it on every customer segment. We're constantly testing marketing, direct marketing with different customers and different methods of direct marketing. And when something connects, we do more of it. When it doesn't connect, we don't do it as much. And when we're not satisfied with our performance, we will work and put some extra focus there. So it really was something that we weren't pleased with, we weren't connecting as well as we liked and made some changes to make sure that we did, and that improvement happened. In January, it's really hard -- as Dave mentioned before, it's really hard to see some of the external numbers affecting -- the external things that went on, we don't really see it in our numbers. We believe some of that is probably really driven because we had connected better with some of those customer segments for some of the things we had put in place. What happened at other companies, we really don't have insight into that. But we really didn't see the -- in total, the variability as we mentioned from a day-to-day basis we do.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then if I can just squeeze in one more follow-up. Can you give any color on the tonnage trends? As you look back over the year between the core grocery categories and the fresh, you mentioned kind of the seafood being strong. But any more color there you can give us?","W. Rodney McMullen","It improved throughout the year, and it was broad based on the improvement in all categories. So it really would be difficult to call out one area being stronger than the other. The only area that I would probably specifically call out is, obviously, pharmacy had great script count growth throughout the year, and our natural foods area had a phenomenal year as well. And it was strong throughout the year.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Greg Hessler from Bank of America.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So I apologize, I missed a little bit of the beginning of the call. I was just wondering if you could talk about the upcoming maturity, the $400 million maturity in April? Do you plan to turn that out into debt capital markets?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. We've talked -- we have not talked about that yet on the call. We actually had a maturity right at the beginning of this fiscal year that we drew down -- that we actually have refinanced with commercial paper on a temporary basis. And then, as you said, we have the other maturity in April. Our expectation would be that sometime in April, that we would term those out. If you look at our SEC filings, we already have a significant amount of that kind of an issuance contemplated and hedged out from an interest rate standpoint, and that coverage goes out until April. So it may not be the exact day. But dependent on market conditions, I would expect, somewhere around that time, we will wind up terming those out.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So that could be maybe up to $1 billion in size. Any thoughts on tenor there? Do you have any preference for shorter-dated stuff? Or should we be thinking about 10s or 30s? Or what are your thoughts there?","J. Michael Schlotman","We'll let the market tell us where the sweet spot is. Sometimes, we may start out with a particular idea. And then we find out, as you start to look at the market on that particular day, that there's a hole on our maturity chart that fits with what the market has an appetite for on that particular day. So rather than lock myself in, when we go to market, we'll let the market tells us what makes the most sense.","David B. Dillon","And before we end the call today, I would like to share a few additional thoughts with our associates who we encouraged to listen in today. 2013 marks the 130th anniversary when Barney Kroger opened his first store in Cincinnati, Ohio. This is an amazing accomplishment, and yet 2 of our banners have been in business even longer: Ralph's division, which is 140 years old; and the Jay C Foods division, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year.","Our heritage of enduring growth and reinvention gives us great confidence for the future. Each of you played a big part in the success in 2012. Working together as a team, we made shopping more easy and efficient for our customers, and they're giving us credit for all of our hard work. We also helped keep costs under control so that we could invest the savings and lower prices. A special thanks to each of you for your contributions.","This week, we also thank 36 special Kroger associates for their extraordinary efforts for our company and our communities. We honor these associates because they represent strong leadership, courage and character. They live our leadership model and our values by leading effective teams, serving local community organizations, making healthy lifestyle changes and more. You can find more about each of our honorees by watching our live quarterly broadcast tomorrow or reading their inspiring stories at the greatpeople.me website in the coming weeks.","That completes our call today.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kate Ward","Thanks, Carrie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As we all know, sometimes are just more challenging than others and last year certainly didn\u2019t end the way we expected at the start of the year, but 2016 still had its bright spots. Of course our associates and our customers are always at bright spot and I\u2019m so proud of this team for their continuing focus on taking care of our customers each and every time they interact in our stores.","Despite the challenging operating environment, our team pulled together to deliver some results that we should take stock of. Over the past year, the Kroger team delivered our 12th consecutive year of market share growth, overall tonnage growth, record high unit share in our corporate brands portfolio, which was lead by another blockbuster $1.7 billion year for Simple Truth.","A strategic merger with specialty pharmacy leader ModernHEALTH and reached an agreement to merge with the world\u2019s greatest purveyor of specialty cheese Murray's Cheese. And we created more than 12,000 new American jobs in our stores and hired more than 9,000 veterans and military family members. That's a lot to be proud of.","We're obviously disappointed with our identical supermarket sales number in the fourth quarter and our performance on several other KPIs, including FIFO operating margin and return on invested capital, which were driven by the deflationary environment.","Kroger is always focused on executing against our long-term strategy. We are lowering cost to invest those savings in our people, our business, and the technologies to position Kroger to deliver the value proposition customers are seeking today and in the future.","One example of our efforts to control administrative cost is making the very difficult decision to extend the voluntary retirement offer for certain non-store associates that we announced in December. Approximately 2,000 non-store associates were eligible for the offer. And at this point, we estimate approximately 1,300 will accept it.","As our customers change and evolve, we are taking steps to meet them where they are and more importantly where they are going. We\u2019re making meaningful investments in digital. We feel great about these investments because customers tell us they are important to them.","We've aggressively added more than 420 ClickList and ExpressLane locations in 2016 bringing our total online ordering locations to more than 640. This effort was based on learnings from our merger with Harris Teeter. We are also experimenting with ways to solve the last mile equation. We're testing with Uber delivery in several locations with plans to expand in 2017 where our customers can order through ClickList and choose to have their groceries delivered by a local Uber driver. We have a couple of other home delivery tests as well.","We're building our digital experiences today so that customers can engage and shop for anything, anytime, anywhere with us in the future. The excellent service they get from our associates in the stores will carryover seamlessly to the digital platforms whether shopping online, finding great promotions and recipes that are personalized and relevant to them, or downloading one of the more than 1 billion digital offers loaded through shopper cards each year.","More and more customers are connecting digitally with Kroger. We are leveraging refined customer insights from 8451 as well as years of online shopping experience from both Vitacost.com and Harris Teeter to develop a sophisticated understanding of our customers\u2019 behavior when shopping with us online, in store and both.","We're utilizing this rich data set to make decisions about where the right locations to offer ClickList, what are the right assortments and promotions to engage customers online and how can we offer the quality and convenience online that customers\u2019 have come to expect from a Kroger brick-and-mortar location.","We are also keenly aware of gowing customer trends like health and wellness and high-quality fresh and prepared foods. Our initiatives in these areas are designed to deliver convenience to our time-starved customers and will continue to be a big focus at both our capital and customer first investments.","Now we could stop all of these investments given the headwinds our industry is facing. That might make our results look better today, but we are playing for the long-term. And that requires being deliberate and determined. There are a lot of companies out there right now investing in digital and e-commerce in opportunistic ways that will likely never create value for their shareholders.","Core strength of Kroger is our ability to both create shareholder value today and to make meaning strategic investments for the future. We remain determined to execute on our strategy and we are deliberately investing to grow and create long-term value for shareholders.","Our corporate brands business was another real bright spot in 2016. Our brands are in more homes than ever before. In fact, our customers fill their carts with more than 1.25 million corporate brand items every hour. We are incredibly proud of the quality of our corporate brand products. Our quality is only getting better and that showed clearly in the corporate brands performance last year when we sold a record number of units and in the fourth quarter when corporate brands had an all time high unit share of 29.2%.","Simple Truth grew at an impressive rate again in 2016 reaching total sales of $1.7 billion. Simple Truth Organic accounted for more than $1 billion of that figure last year and we still see more growth ahead in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines. In fact, we began offering Simple Truth to even more customers throughout the United States by making it available on Vitacost.com. Today, you can find online we conveniently ship to home many of our Simple Truth food, snacks and supplements as well as household and personal care products. Interestingly, New York City is already the number two Simple Truth online sales market for us even though we don\u2019t have store physical presence there.","As you know, we always build our business plan assuming the environment is going to get more competitive the next year and not less. We also don\u2019t run a business model that relies on inflation returning. Rather we proactively make the changes we need to remain competitive well into the future. Kroger\u2019s core steps remain on most valuable assets. On the people front, we have great associates, an effective and experienced management team, and a deep bench of future leaders.","On the financial front, a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to create sustainable shareholder value and on the customer front, deep customer insights through our data analytic experts at 8451, and above all an unwavering commitment to putting our customers first. What also remains unchanged is our commitment to long term growth that investors can count on. Over the last five years, Kroger\u2019s annual net earnings per diluted share growth rate was 16.3% excluding one-time items. Over the last three years, it was 14.2% excluding one-time items. We remain committed to delivering our long term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend.","And now, Mike will go into more detail on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone. Kroger\u2019s market share grew for the twelfth year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive both top and bottom line growth and generate blasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it where they spend the money. According to Nielsen Plus data, Kroger\u2019s overall market share with the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points in 2016 with 14 of 22 markets up too flat and six markets down. Starting in 2017, we plan to begin using IRI point of sale data to measure market share. While we expect there to be some differences in share reporting between Nielsen and IRI, we expect those differences to be minimal. Regardless of the source, we use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It is also worth noting that market share data is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales.","Looking at ID sales, deflation was the primary driver of our negative results for the quarter. Inflation adjusted ID sales were positive in the fourth quarter. Deflation excluding fuel persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw decline in pharmacy inflation and acceleration in produce deflation and a slowing in grocer deflation. Another headwind to ID sales was our capital program. Over the last four quarters, we relocated or expanded 35 strong performing stores taking them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. This caused about 70 basis point headwind to ID sales in the fourth quarter.","Tonnage was positive during the fourth quarter and we continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products which by the way hit nearly $16 billion in sales in 2016 in areas where we are saving customers time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions. We always give a little insight into our ID sales data. Visits per household and price per unit were down in the fourth quarter but those were slightly offset by basket size and household growth. Loyal households continue to grow at a faster rate than total households which was true for both the quarter and the year. It is interesting to note that loyal household had slightly positive ID growth in the fourth quarter.","Operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales excluding fuel, recent mergers, and a $30 million contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 11 basis points; rent and depreciation with the same exclusions increased by 24 basis points. While this result was better than the third quarter, we can and will do better. We are working diligently to pull costs out of the business and improve processes to lower cost as a rate of sales and deliver value to customers.","Now, for an update on retail fuel, in the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $0.0218 versus $0.0192 in the same quarter last year. For 2016 in total, we are at $0.171 for the year and $0.174 in 2015. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.31 times compared to 2.08 times during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and increases in working capital. ","The increase in working capital is driven by higher inventory in four locations where we open new or expanded distribution centers. When doing this, we duplicate inventory for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. Also, accrued liabilities are lower due to lower incentive plan payout accruals. This fortune will reverse in the first quarter when incentive plan cash payments will be lower. It is worth noting that over longer time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we continue to work with our unions to modify pension plans. We continue to negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates\u2019 future benefits as we did in the second quarter. These restructurings do not change the total obligations of the company because the debt we add is offset by a reduction in the amount of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.","In 2016, Kroger used cash to repurchase $1.8 million in common shares, paid $429 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and to merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities total $3.6 billion for the year compared to $3.5 billion last year. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09%. This result was affected by current year results and recently merged companies. We are committed to growing return on invested capital with the long term.","I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy\u2019s distribution center and with the UFCW for North Carolina clerks and meat associates. We are currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta, and Michigan. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefit for our associates. Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs with some of our competitors do not face.","Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates with importance of growing Kroger's business and doing it profitably, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we anticipate identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth for 2017. We expect net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 benefit for the 53rd week. We anticipate the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar to the second half of 2016. Our results in the second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle to previous year.","We recognize that this is an unusual year and that\u2019s why we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate as we\u2019ve done in the past. In fact for the first quarter, we are going to give you an earnings per share range, which is not something we plan to do over the long-term, but we think it\u2019s important to be very clear about how we think the year is going to progress.","For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be slightly up compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be up high-single digits compared to last year without the benefit of the 53rd week.","Our guidance for the year excludes the estimated cost of the voluntary retirement offer, but does include the anticipated expense savings, which we will reinvest in the business. Over the long-term we are committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. We expect a LIFO charge of $25 million for the year. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017.","Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives. As we invest more in these areas, our investment in stores will be reduced. As we anticipate Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike. We've never been more determined about our future. We continue to focus on gaining a larger share in the $1.5 trillion U.S. food market. We are working on process changes to lower cost and use those savings to invest in our people, our business and technologies that will enhance Kroger's competitiveness in the future.","We will continue to deliver for our customers today while setting the company up for our next phase of growth and customer-first innovation. We know that when we deliver for our customers, we create long-term value for our shareholders.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities LLC. Please go ahead.","Q - John Heinbockel","So, Rodney, let me start with ClickList. Generally speaking, what\u2019s the roll out plan for 2017 or do you want to study the 420 a bit more? And then what have you learned from the 420 you did last year in terms of driving new customer acquisition and in building share wallet with loyal households? Anything you can share on that?","Rodney McMullen","Okay. If you look at the 2017 plan, at this point, we would expect probably to open a few less in 2017 than 2016, but it's not driven by the enthusiasm for ClickList, it's driven by findings stores with the space and incorporating it getting zoning changes and anything else that we need to do. One of the things \u2013 probably the biggest learning that at least been a surprise to me, may probably not for others, is customers continue to shop inside the store even when they become a ClickList customer. And they will buy certain products via ClickList, but they still come into the store.","If you look at the more mature locations, you can start seeing more financially they start getting to the point where really indifferent in terms of whether somebody shops in store or online. Obviously, that's just the early ones that have been opened more at Harris Teeter than at Kroger. So we continue to have that headwind and we will continue to have that headwind in 2017 just because of the sheer number that were opening and the number that we opened late in 2016, but they continue to mature and we can clearly see it at a point where we're actually indifferent on how the customer shops with us.","John Heinbockel","Okay. And then just shifting gears to maybe not related to financial questions, FIFO gross margin ex-fuel, a little more pressure in the fourth quarter than prior quarters. Where did that come from? And then the first quarter when you look at the cadence in the first quarter earnings number, obviously, substantial deviation from the rest of the year. So, curious is that driven by \u2013 you would think it\u2019s driven by aberrational, I don't know if that's pension or shrink or what drives that?","Rodney McMullen","I will let Mike talk about the quarter stuff, but on the \u2013 if you look at the gross, it's really a combination of several things. Some would be driven by pharmacy continues to be a headwind on gross; other areas, there we have definitely become more promotional and more aggressive on some pricing as our sales were softer. So it\u2019s really both of those elements together. Mike, I will let you answer the quarter comment.","Mike Schlotman","Sure, John. As I\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, we do expect the first half of the year to be much like how 2016 ended and it's really just carrying the current trends out through the first \u2013 as you know this is a 16-week quarter for us \u2013 through those first 16 weeks of the year. And we see the clarity to some of the programs Rodney mentioned and the fact that we continue to drive unit growth. We do expect to see the recovery in the sales later in the year.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs & Company. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal","Hi, good morning, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Stephen Tanal","I guess I want to just ask what you guys are seeing in a competitive environment to start, clearly, there is at least some chains that are putting up slightly better comps or better comps and obviously versus Nielsen, it looks like you're gaining share, but I wonder what you're seeing and if you feel like there is a certain customer you may be losing or if there's something you can comment on markets where you're competing with more online, challengers, just any color there in terms of where you think some of the traffic may be headed?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at from a competitive environment, most of the changes that we would see is competitors running better stores. I don't think there's any doubt that they are, most of you and lot others have read about it. Certainly, it wouldn\u2019t \u2013 there isn\u2019t anything that would show that it's going to online at all. So it would be more driven by some of the competitors running better stores versus other aspects. I don\u2019t Mike anything you'd want to add to that.","Mike Schlotman","No.","Stephen Tanal","I guess, is that \u2013 can you give a sense for whether it's a lower-end customer or higher-income consumer or right in the middle or any color you can provider there?","Rodney McMullen","If you look \u2013 on one of the comments that Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks was when you look at our loyal shopper, we actually had positive identicals with our loyal shoppers, so it\u2019s really the customer though. What isn\u2019t very loyal to us is where we're seeing it. That would be more driven by value shoppers or shoppers on a budget than mainstream and customers that really value the experience in the freshness of our product and other aspects.","Stephen Tanal","I guess, so it's safe to say you're probably not seeing anything all too different in sort of a bigger, denser, more affluent cities that you are in where there are more home delivery options and I just have a couple of more follow-up on that \u2013 one more after that.","Rodney McMullen","We are really not seeing it from that aspect at all. And the other thing I think is important to note, we aggressively increased the amount of capital we were spending and increased the number of stores that we were relocating and remodeling. Mike mentioned it. But if you look at about 35 stores, we relocated or expanded which took amount of the identical calculation which actually hurt our total company identical by 70 basis points. So I think that\u2019s other thing that\u2019s important to remember.","Stephen Tanal","That\u2019s helpful. And just a last one from me maybe for Mike, the impact of the early retirement offer on OGNA if you could sort of quantify that perhaps maybe is that ramping through the year, is that maybe why the year looks little more back half waited and then we need a guess there.","Mike Schlotman","Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, as we finalize what the expense of that will be, that will be reflective in the first quarter. The offer is not entirely close so we won\u2019t know until next week exactly how many people ultimately accepted the offer. And there will be varying times when people ultimately retire so that does go throughout the year as those folks ultimately retire. Do keep in mind as I said in prepared remarks was we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates. We do have the savings in their plan and\/or a portion of what we plan to invest to increase the value proposition for our customers.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris Mandeville","Hi, good morning guys. So just maybe sticking with the guidance here, is it fair to assume that gross margins will be done in a similar fashion for the first half this year which is kind of given, a4 results and commentary for the full year being down 10 basis points. And then I guess for the back half of the year, that would imply \u2013 I would assume some gross margin expansion to some degree. I guess maybe Q4 but can you help us understand why Q3 should be implying 20% EPS growth. And lastly, how does deflation or inflation for that matter play into 1H versus 2H? Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. I mean there is a variety of contributing factors. Obviously going back to the first quarter where cycling one of if not the strongest quarter from the prior year, we had high-teens earnings per share growth with 2.4 IDs in the first quarter of last year. So we are up against our toughest compare for one thing. Also, as we go through the year, I\u2019m not going \u2013 I won\u2019t break down gross profit by quarter. We try to stick with ID sales and operating profit. We do plan to continue to make the investments as I said in the value proposition for our customers which we think will continue to drive IDs back into the positive range.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Please go-ahead.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Just on the guidance, just to clarify one or two things, so guidance does include buybacks correct?","Mike Schlotman","It does.","Karen Short","Okay. And I would assume that maybe given that you\u2019ll have more free cash flow this year than last, the priorities will be skewed to buyback?","Mike Schlotman","We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback we\u2019ll do and obviously it depended on market conditions as well as our Board being willing to give us incremental authorization. We will run out of our existing authorization here in the very near term. We\u2019ve been buying shares since late last year and all through so far this year off of the greatest average 10b5-1. So we\u2019re somewhat predicated and our Board given this incremental authority.","Karen Short","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So, Rodney, is there something?","Rodney McMullen","The other thing that Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, if you look at the range of estimated capital investment, 2017 is lower than 2016 as well.","Karen Short","Great. Okay, with that in mind, I guess when I look at your guidance and I try to kind of back in operating profit growth, it does look like you can get there but with some pretty meaningful offsets to SG&A in terms of SG&A per week. And SG&A peek has been growing pretty meaningfully and I know you point into that as an area of opportunity and he talked about that a lot in this call. But I guess I\u2019m just trying to reconcile like how much you actually have to get that done to achieve your guidance, but also reconciling that with the EU, you want to invest for the long term? So I wonder if you could talk to that a little bit.","Mike Schlotman","I can tell you there were lot of efforts we have underway to reduce our total cost of doing business and it\u2019s in a variety of areas. We can do better on shrink, we can do better on store productivity in some areas, we can certainly do better on in stock in some areas. And one of the great things about being in a company of this size and breadth of Kroger is, there is not an initiative we have out there that we don\u2019t already have, a very large group of stores achieving. We don\u2019t have to go outside the company and point to competitor actually doing this so we are. Every metric we have out there for our storage to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results, and as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, that\u2019s one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the four piece.","Karen Short","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Two questions related to our deflation, first I wanted to sense of what you guys are assuming for deflation or inflation this year and whether you expect to return a positive growth or positive prices later this year. And then secondly related to that, we are hearing more and more announcements from Target, Wal-Mart and others just talking more about price investments. Do you expect I guess the deflationary impact of competitor actions to be potentially more this year than what you\u2019ve seen in recent years?","Mike Schlotman","I think you\u2019re doing what a lot of people do including this morning when I was on CNBC of mixing inflation and deflation at cost and retail. When we talk about our inflation or deflation it\u2019s our product cost inflation or deflation. You kind of through and what\u2019s going to happen to retail product cost inflation or deflation. And overall, we do think that we will return to a slightly inflationary environment in the back half of the year. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that we pretty much add, I think Rodney was talking before with one of the callers, nine quarters in a row of deflation, declining inflation\/deflation. I\u2019ll be there inflation coming down or actual deflation, it\u2019s nine straight quarters now but that trend volume would be down. So it\u2019s been obviously fairly persistent. Despite that, even though we had a lot lower pharmacy inflation in the quarter that still generated a very large LIFO charge, it was offset by other areas that had deflation. So it\u2019s a completely mixed bag. Even in the fourth quarter, grocery inflation over the course of the quarter was basically half of what it was in the third quarter but produce inflation went up 600 basis points or deflation expanded by 600 basis points, and that was over 7% deflation in the quarter. So it\u2019s a huge mixed bag of what\u2019s out there and I\u2019m not going to pinpoint an exact number because I\u2019ve proven over the years that I can predict a totally inaccurate number on inflation or even LIFO, but we continue to manage through the process that we have.","Rodney McMullen","As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do expect the market to get more competitive. We\u2019ve assumed that for a long period of time. We continue to see great opportunities for process change and taking cost out of the business, and the last couple of calls I\u2019ve mentioned that we\u2019re doubling down on those. In the fourth quarter, we made more progress on those than we did in the third quarter and you can begin to see some of those things paying some fruit. As Mike mentioned, we are starting to cycle actual deflation. We think the first part of the year will still look awful lot like third and fourth quarter but once you get to the third quarter you start cycling some of those strong deflationary numbers and we didn\u2019t see it. The other thing that I think is important to note if you look at cost of goods, there is all kinds of things that we are doing to finance and pay for some of that for cost of goods savings and other pieces of business as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. Thank you for all the color.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Sinisi","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Just wanted to see, with the promotional environment any further color on promotions by categories, is it fair to say that the most deflationary is also getting the most promotions. And then also just in relation to that if you could give any further color around the cadence expected in addition to the very helpful EPS guidance by quarter? Thank you.","Mike Schlotman","The promotions by category, we would use our 8451 insights for that and it would really be different by customer, some of it would be things that you would do personalized one-on-one. So, it actually \u2013 if you go into the store from checking the retail price you wouldn't see it because of its offers that are made directly to customers, sums via coupons. It's all the above because different customers react different ways to different promotions, so it\u2019s becoming increasingly personalized offers based on what that particular customer wants and desires are. And it would be a mix of national brand, corporate brands and fresh product and others, so it's really a mix on the comp by quarter. Mike, I will let you\u2026","Mike Schlotman","Yeah, if you to repeat your question, I want to make sure I\u2019m answering the question you are asking, not what I have in head.","Vincent Sinisi","Yeah, sure, Mike. Just wondering if you could kind of give us in relation to your full year ID sales guidance, how you are thinking about that on a quarterly basis, maybe if any color around kind of where things are now and\/or just how you are kind of thinking about that as we go forward each quarter?","Mike Schlotman","Well the comment about we expect the first quarter to look a lot like the first quarter, I guess, would be a little bit of coat for ID sales continue to be a little bit negative right now, which means we expect ID sales to recover as we go throughout the year. And that's going back to the questions that we've gotten on the cadence of how we expect to see the underlying EPS is that is predicated on an improvement in ID sales throughout the year.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, perfect. And if I could just get a quick follow-up in there. Just any updates worth highlighting with you partnership with Lucky's? Thanks a lot.","Rodney McMullen","Sure. Bo and his team out there in Colorado continue to do some exciting things inside their stores, some of the new storages they've opened. We're pretty excited about the sales levels they\u2019ve been able to generate. Bo continues to look at his book of business and his stores, and they are a very new company. He's learning as he goes and he continue to make tweaks to his model and stop doing some things that aren\u2019t working and try some new things that seem to have \u2013 should be bearing fruit. But we're very pleased with what we see out of Bo and his team and continue to be enthusiastic about that kind of a format.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, great. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thank you. The 70 basis point headwind from removing some of these high performing stores from the ID sales base, I'm just trying to figure out, I don't think you\u2019ve divulged that number in the past very often, maybe you have and I missed it, but how does that compare to what you saw in recent years? I'm just trying to figure out is it an unusually high impact because you didn't do necessarily more relocations than you normally did. So was it just that the stores were so much better in taking them out of the base just hadn\u2019t that much more of an impact or maybe 70 basis points is similar to what you normally experience? Just trying to get a sense there.","Rodney McMullen","It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve talked about a whole lot and it\u2019s one of those things when you \u2013 if you have 3% or 4% IDs and you have a strong capital program and it\u2019s 30 or 40 or 50 basis points of headwinds from sister store impacts, the effect of that is dramatic as it is when you are close to 0 ID sales and negative. So, we haven\u2019t really talked about it. We did in the third quarter \u2013 20 to 30 basis points\u2026","Mike Schlotman","Is what it typically is.","Rodney McMullen","So it is a bit higher today because we have been doing more stores. A couple of three years ago, we were under $3 billion in capital and we were above $3.5 billion in capital this year. So we have ramped up our capital spend. We are touching more stores, we\u2019re opening more new stores, which causes sister store impact and expanding and relocating some very strong stores, which continue to perform very well, but haven't been brand reopened long enough to be into our identical store base yet.","Ken Goldman","So that's hopeful. Just to clarify, so it sounds like incrementally \u2013 it is rough, I know, but you're talking 40, 50 basis points of a headwind versus what you normally experience from this effect and just curious\u2026","Mike Schlotman","And when you look at the number of stores we did over the last year compared to two or three years ago, it\u2019s about double, major store projects.","Ken Goldman","So then looking ahead, is it safe to assume we will still seeing roughly a 70 basis point impact over the next three quarters or so and then how do we think about that in years beyond, is that \u2013 this is an unusual effect or do you continue to think that you're maybe \u2013 just again generally going to be relocating, expanding some of your higher performing stores in the future?","Mike Schlotman","Well, as those stores are open long enough they will flip back into our ID store base. And we would hope they continue to perform the way they are in the tailwind ID sales. And as I\u2019ve said in the prepared comments, we are taking capital down from what we would originally plan to spend in 2017 because we've been guiding folks to think about 2017 and even 2018 to be a similar spend level that we did 2016 and most of that will come out of new store. And we will continue a strong remodel program, so when we remodel a store, it does not come out of IDs, it's only an expansion or relocation or a net new that winds up affecting it.","Ken Goldman","Right. And then, relocation. So just to clarify, Mike, those, is it reasonable to assume that sort of 70-ish basis point headwind will continue for the next few -- three quarters or so?","Mike Schlotman","I think it will continue for a while, but it will decline over time as those stores become identical again.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","The next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Shane Higgins","Good morning. Just want to get a better understanding of the cadence of your tonnage growth and your nonfuel IDs during the fourth quarter, if you guys could kind of talk about what happened after early December when you guys were seeing or expecting trends to be slightly positive, just want to try to get some color there.","Rodney McMullen","If you look at during the quarter, it started out slow when we had the earnings call, it actually during the holidays improved and then January it slowed down again. So if you look at during the quarter, that's kind of the cadence within the quarter. I always hate to use weather as an excuse, but we had absolutely no weather benefits this year. The negative of that is we had no weather benefits. The positive is next year if we have any weather at all we cycle that.","Mike Schlotman","And if you look at the prior year, we didn't have much weather either and in fact the only one big weather event we had was the last weekend of the year in last year's numbers. So our year ended against the only weather event we had in the prior year with no weather this year.","Rodney McMullen","Tonnage growth cadence remained positive, but it's because of the deflation, but obviously around the holidays was stronger than two sides of the holiday.","Shane Higgins","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just, Rodney, back to your earlier comments that you guys were a bit more aggressive on your pricing and promotions during the quarter. Was that kind of a decision based on some of the insights that you're getting from your customers that you decided to make greater investments in price versus maybe investing in other areas of the store? And were those concentrated in any specific regions in response to the competitive environment out there? Any color there would be great.","Rodney McMullen","They were very broad-based and anything like \u2013 anything that we would do, we would use our insights to decide what our approach is.","Shane Higgins","Okay. All right. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Shane.","Operator","The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Please go ahead.","Alvin Concepcion","Thanks and thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the competitive environment. I think you mentioned earlier you're seeing it from competitors running better stores. What about in the form of pricing or promotions? Are you seeing major changes there since the quarter ended?","Rodney McMullen","I wouldn't say changes since the quarter ended. I would say that definitely are seeing some pricing in certain pockets. I never tried to calculate on a percentage basis, but any point in time you will always have competitors doing things from a pricing standpoint.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. And just a follow-up on some things about your delivery initiatives. You mentioned you'll be expanding Uber in 2017. Wondering if you could speak to that. Is that something that's been driving incremental sales and profitability and how many stores are covered by Uber at this point in time and how many do you expect in the future?","Rodney McMullen","Well, it's a pretty small test. We're early in the process. And it would \u2013 the same comment that I made earlier about \u2013 on ClickList, it's a headwind, but you can see as they mature it becomes where we're neutral in terms of how a customer engages with us. In terms of specific numbers that we would expect for this year, we're not to the point where we'd be willing to share it other than obviously we're working hard to scale it if it makes sense in ways that it makes sense.","Alvin Concepcion","If I could sneak one in, just related to that, Vitacost, it sounds like you've expanded it with Simple Truth. Just wondering about your future plans to expand beyond Simple Truth into other categories and is this a preferred delivery method versus Uber?","Rodney McMullen","Well, we would look at all the delivery options together and really leaving it up to customer how they want to engage with us. We'll continue to add items to Vitacost that make sense and the Simple Truth product is obviously the initial part of that.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Alvin.","Operator","The next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Good morning, guys. Just two quick things. Thanks for the color on the first quarter trends to date. I was just curious or maybe, Rodney, you can remind us, do delayed tax refunds, are they having an impact on your business and maybe give us some history on that? And I have a follow-up question.","Rodney McMullen","On the delayed tax refunds, I don\u2019t know \u2013 I really don't have very much insight into it. If you look, most of our products aren't as discretionary as some of the other retailers that have talked about it.","Mike Schlotman","Robby, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint. My conclusion, without meeting with some other folks and having conversation, would be that the timing of those doesn't affect us in a big way like it does other folks because over my time here at Kroger I've never heard anybody talk about I can't wait till tax refunds drop so we can get a boost in sales. So it just doesn't \u2013 I agree with what Rodney's conclusion is based on most of what we sell.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. And the only exception would be like in Alaska where you get paid to live in Alaska and it's based on the size of the check, based on fuel profits or gasoline profits for the state.","Mike Schlotman","Pipeline.","Rodney McMullen","From the pipeline. And that you can clearly see when the checks go out and the size of the checks from year to year.","Mike Schlotman","But those are all great big Fred Meyer stores with a lot of general merchandise.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. That's helpful. Then just the other question the Roundy's integration, can you just give us maybe more update on that and was it a drag to the fourth quarter and when could Roundy's become a year-over-year sort of tailwind for you guys?","Mike Schlotman","So if you look at the \u2013 if you look at Roundy's overall, we continue to be very happy with what Michael Marks and team were doing in Wisconsin as well as Don Rosanova and team in Chicagoland with the two banners. Mike and team have cycled through the first set of store remodels and offerings to the customers who are now in second market getting remodels completed and then we'll put a full campaign in that market. And then if we continue to see the positive reaction from the customers from ID sales dollars and units, we\u2019d expect to continue to roll that out throughout the state. From an ID stand sales standpoint, it really didn't affect it very much in the quarter certainly not as much as it did earlier in the year.","Robby Ohmes","Great, thanks. It's really helpful.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Robby.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Kelly","Yeah, hi, good morning, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Ed Kelly","Thanks for taking my question. Rodney, could we start \u2013 I just have a big picture question, if we think back over the years what the analysts meetings that you've had, you used to put up a slide showing the gap between your ID growth and your peers highlighting what's really been very remarkable consistent share gains. And as we think about the fourth quarter now and you think about the results that some other players are putting up, specifically, Walmart is a good example, it just doesn't seem like that type of share gain is continuing. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think this momentum is changing importantly how is it impacting the way that you're thinking about strategy and specifically the cadence around price investments going forward?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, well, I\u2019ll answer the question a little broader than just one specific competitor. But with the comment that I made earlier, there is no doubt, several competitors are improving and running better stores. So that is really clear when you go into their stores and it's much broader than just a Walmart. In terms of the things that we're doing, we\u2019re really doubling down on the customer experience; we\u2019re getting even more aggressive on process change and taking costs outward, it makes sense to take costs out and improving the competitiveness of our model.","So, in terms of what are we doing about it, those would be the things that we're doing about it, because what we find is certain customers are interested in price, but all they want is a fair price, they're really, really interested in having fresh produce fresh meat and a great experience and those are things that we have competitive advantages on and will continue to focus on that and our store teams and our folks \u2013 our associates across the whole company will continue to focus on those.","Ed Kelly","As we think about the industry now going forward, it certainly seems like the next five years could certainly be more challenging than the last five just given what we're hearing from competitors around what they're doing from a pricing perspective, you've talked about players being better at actually just running stores. We've got online to deal. We\u2019ve got hard discount the deal with. Do you think that it makes sense that the industry could enter another wave of consolidation and how are you thinking about M&A versus organic store growth now from here?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look, I've been around for 30-some years and I always would tell you that we've always felt that the next five years are going to be more competitive than the last five. I would definitely agree with that comment today. We definitely believe the next five will be more competitive than the last five because only the strong survive.","If you look at in terms of \u2013 we feel very excited about the opportunities that we have to continue to grow our business and I put it in two buckets, some of it is operational driven where if you look at the historical business that we\u2019re in, getting better at that, but if you think about the comments that you hear us increasingly talk about looking at the opportunity in the $1.5 trillion total food business, we continue to get more, more aggressive in terms of fresh food, fresh food prepared, what's for dinner and picking things up and that continues to grow well for us.","So we really see that that continues to be a large growth opportunity. And I would say, at the moment, we can see the opportunity more than the things that we're doing. When you were out for our investor meeting you saw some of the things we're testing, but we really continue to improve and get better and better about that part of the business. And one of the things that we've been very pleasantly surprised is the willingness that our customers are to eat in one of our stores and we believe that that will be an opportunity to grow the business and create a new leg, a platform for growth. So it's really both of those things together.","Ed Kelly","And M&A any more, less important for you going forward do you think?","Rodney McMullen","I would say it's kind of the same. If the right opportunity became available we would be very interested, but we don't \u2013 we haven't changed in terms of we design a model where M&A is not required and if the right opportunity comes available, we would sit down and talk to somebody. But it's not something that we\u2019re out proactively trying to change that.","Ed Kelly","Great, thanks, and good luck guys.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Ed.","Mike Schlotman","Thanks. We have time for one more question.","Operator","All right. Our last question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.","Chuck Cerankosky","My question was previously asked, so I will pass it on to someone else.","Rodney McMullen","All right, thanks, Chuck.","Operator","Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about volume as of late. I think there has been \u2013 our industry data and a lot of industry data seems to suggest some pretty weak volume and I think a lot of that data is skewed towards center store categories, but I'm just curious what your assessment is if you feel like you're seeing any similar surprisingly weakness in volume particularly quarter to date and if you think it has anything to do with channel shifting or change in consumer behavior or just may be a result of this prolonged deflationary environment?","Rodney McMullen","Well, we continue to see very much where people are increasingly spending money in the fresh departments. So there is no doubt there is a shift in tonnage from the center store to the perimeter and that\u2019s been a long term shift and that hasn\u2019t changed. If you look at the center store, we would still see tonnage growth there but remember that\u2019s an organic part of what\u2019s driving that growth. Natural organic is not \u2013 there is few public companies where you can just see that by itself and if you look at even for us, Mike talked about our total natural organic business at about $16 billion. Our Simple Truth brand by itself is $1.7 billion of that, so over 10% and those are things that you really don\u2019t see in some of the other measures. So the center stores have been soft for a long period of time but we\u2019ve continued to getting share in the center store and we also continue to change the mix of what\u2019s inside the center store.","Mike Schlotman","And different category reinventions with coffee and pet and baby where we\u2019ve totally redone to look and feel those departments for our customer.","Kelly Bania","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess lastly the shift to IRI, is there any reason or anything you can tell us about kind of making that shift from Nielsen to IRI?","Rodney McMullen","We announced earlier in the year and the relationship with IRI that we didn\u2019t talk about a whole lot, and it\u2019s really just furthering that relationship with them. And they have a few nuggets of data that Nielsen may not have but we think it\u2019s going to be helpful to us overall as we look at our volume in the overall food industry not just the integration store industry.","Kelly Bania","Great. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Kelly. Before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Thank you for continuing to connect with our customers every day. They are rewarding us with their business. With your help, we gain more the market and improved our customer satisfaction scores in 2016. Thank you for your hard work. For those associates who are choosing to accept the voluntary retirement offer, thank you for your contributions to Kroger. I know for some the decision to retire was not an easy one. You should note Kroger would not be the company it is today without your years of dedicated service. Each of you has made a difference in the lives of our customers, our communities and each other, and we are very grateful for all of your contributions. Thank you.","That completes our call today.

Please go ahead.","Kate Ward ","Thanks Laura. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger\u2019s first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share, and achieving Kroger\u2019s 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance, and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.","We\u2019ve managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment, and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we\u2019ll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that we create value for shareholders, as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate, on a compounded annual basis, was 14.1% for three years, and 18.8% for five years.","We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities, and our strategic partnerships.","Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders.","Many people come here for a job and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career. Despite record-low unemployment figures, when we held a one-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our Opportunity Culture as a competitive advantage.","We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly. Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets, with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website. And we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com\u2019s ship-to-home technology and platform.","Earlier this week, Kroger\u2019s technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 places to work by Computerworld magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We\u2019ve launched a new website, kroger.com\/livekt, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team. Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.","In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky\u2019s Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally-grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky\u2019s because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus a culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky\u2019s approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st Strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.","There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment, or competition. These are all issues that we\u2019ve managed through, some several times, over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I have often said that 2% - 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment.","What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it is even more important to have 84.51\u00b0 on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want, and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it.","Kroger\u2019s core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service and the highest quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout, as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage and both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.","Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low-end to mid-point of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied. And our to-do list remains longer than our done list.","Now, Mike will offer more details on Kroger\u2019s first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks Rodney and good morning everyone.","IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we have been in environments like this before and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units, and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.","Inflation was non-existent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and in fact was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we\u2019ve seen in the last six years.","During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.","Operating costs excluding fuel and Roundy\u2019s were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better, and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse.","We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st Strategy. And as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.","Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by 0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling four quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.","Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70, compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth.","Our integration with Roundy\u2019s is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano\u2019s stores in Chicago. Roundy\u2019s associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.","For our Corporate Brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on new innovations in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health & beauty care.","We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean Black Garlic Kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce.","During the first quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold, and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","The Company\u2019s net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12 times, compared to 2.09 during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders, while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.","Over the last year, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares; pay $397 million in dividends; invest $3.6 billion in capital; and merge with Roundy\u2019s, for $866 million.","Kroger\u2019s strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy\u2019s, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.","I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville, and Southern California.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective growing Kroger\u2019s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy\u2019s results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth.","For full-year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low-end to mid-point of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the five-year average. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter, with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.","We continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. Finally, we continue to expect Kroger\u2019s full-year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. We are proud of our team\u2019s performance during the quarter, especially in light of the challenging operating environment. We\u2019ve been through business cycles like this before. The best thing we can do is to deliver on our promise while investing for the future. We will continue to execute our Customer 1st Strategy and by doing so, we\u2019ll create long-term value for our shareholders. Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Ed Kelly","Can we maybe start off with just color on the cadence of the IDs through Q1? What you\u2019re seeing so far in Q2 and then, Rodney or Mike, could you maybe dissect sort of like tonnage trends versus inflation trends; and then lastly, as part of all that the impact that Roundy\u2019s had on the Q1 comp?","Rodney McMullen","Ed, I\u2019ll start out and let Mike fill in. But, if you look across the quarter, I would say it bounced around a bit. Part of that was driven by weather. Earlier in the quarter, we had basically no weather benefits this year versus a lot in the prior year. As you get towards the end of quarter, Memorial Day moved from the first quarter to the second quarter; and early in the quarter you had Super Bowl. So, there is a lot of things going on. The other thing on inflation; inflation, we had expected that it would start picking up some. And when we look going forward, we just don\u2019t see that picking up. If you look at so far this quarter, we\u2019re inside the range, just slightly below the midpoint of the range of the 2.5% to 3.5%. But, as you know, it\u2019s still very early in the quarter. Overall, the core continues to be strong. And we\u2019re cycling incredibly strong numbers from last year, and tonnage continues to be solid.","I don\u2019t know Mike, anything else you would want to add, or thoughts?","Mike Schlotman","No. One of the things we have done is if you look at our real growth that\u2019s IDs minus the inflation number that we gave. If you look at a two-year stack of that, it is amazingly consistent quarter-to-quarter, less than a 50 basis-point swing when you look at it over the last five or six quarters. So, when you look at things over little bit longer timeframe and you take out the effects of inflation on the reported numbers, our results have actually been amazingly consistent.","Ed Kelly","And Mike, just on the impact of Roundy\u2019s on that 2.4% you report this quarter?","Mike Schlotman","It\u2019s about 30 basis points.","Operator","And the next question will come from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","I know it\u2019s still early with ClickList in some markets, but what have you seen thus far in terms of how that\u2019s changing consumer behavior, and is it yet a new customer acquisition vehicle?","Rodney McMullen","As you started out your question, it\u2019s obviously very early. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments that we\u2019re in now 25 markets. What we\u2019re finding is almost anything you say would be correct. So, there is some new customers. And we find in some situations a customer will spend more with us. But, as you know, we\u2019re so focused on what is it that customer wants and needs are and what we have as some of our customers tell us they really appreciate it. And that\u2019s really why we\u2019re focused on it and continue to roll it out, because some customers find it incredibly helpful. We definitely from everything that we see, we find it an \u201cand\u201d and not a \u201cor\u201d. And the ClickList customer continues to come into the store and it really -- it\u2019s just one more way of making their life a little bit easier.","John Heinbockel","And then, I guess just as a follow-up, do you see -- do you think there is any difference in how you will run ClickList or customer behavior in the marketplace versus a traditional food retail store, given size differences and so forth?","Rodney McMullen","We have it in -- all in both types of stores and we really find the behavior isn\u2019t that much different, but we do not have the marketplace product on the website. So, if somebody wants to buy something from the marketplace site, they have to put in a comment section, \u201ccan you get me that\u201d. And obviously we will. But we don\u2019t see differences in behavior between one type and other. One of the things that\u2019s always part of the consideration is do we have space to do it in a store. And that\u2019s driven as much the decision on a size of store. There is some marketplace stores, we don\u2019t have it in and that we\u2019d like to have it in because we just really don\u2019t have the space to do it.","Operator","Next we have a question from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank.","Shane Higgins","How much you guys characterize the macro environment in the quarter? And any color you have on just the consumer sentiment overall? I think you guys mentioned that units per transaction were down slightly. Is that any kind of indication that consumer might be a bit softer, or any color there would be great?","Mike Schlotman","When you look at the units per basket, they were down slightly but that was overcome by more trips, making more trips to drive more units during the quarter. So, if you just look at those two metrics, it would have been a slight increase in the tonnage, and then the new households pushed the tonnage to be nicely positive. And I think Rodney touched, there is clearly a lot going on out there, the macro environment, there is the inflation and deflation, there is gas retails were rising during the quarter. It was an interesting quarter because there are so many unusual things out there. Our own comparisons to a lot of like Rodney said, the Super Bowl this year, then the weather, then Memorial Day moving. As Rodney said, the cadence of ID sales was really a little bit all over the board, depending on the week you\u2019re looking at. But, our fundamental approach is focused on the customer to make sure we\u2019re delivering on the value propositions that they want. And just based on how they\u2019re shopping, it\u2019s sure seems like we are hitting the mark on that.","Rodney McMullen","On the economy, to me, Mike and I have talked about this, it\u2019s really hard to describe, and it\u2019s very mixed. And how much of that is driven because of the election and everything else, I\u2019ll let somebody that has better insights into that than us to try to speculate on that. The strength certainly doesn\u2019t feel as strong as the numbers suggest. But with that said, if you look at the things that would be discretionary items or more upscale items, if you look at why, Boar's Head, Murray\u2019s, Starbucks, all of those continue to grow very nicely from an identical standpoint and well outperform the total. So, it\u2019s really pretty hard to describe from what we can see.","Shane Higgins","Yes, I appreciate the color, and just a quick follow-up. So, it sounds like you guys are driving additional trips. Is that a function of consumers utilizing your fuel rewards, is it more of a shift towards fresh and produce, more produce more fresh?","Rodney McMullen","You do see those types of items in a lot of the baskets of the incremental trip. And as people strive to eat healthier and need more fresh products rather than buying it and putting in the refrigerator or freezer, it does appear as though they are making their trips to the grocery store little more regularly and buying for a few days rather than for a week long stock up. That\u2019s certainly what it seems to be.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. First, I had a quick clarification to your answer to Ed on the quarter to date trends. I think you said you\u2019re slightly below the midpoint of the range, is that correct?","Rodney McMullen","Correct.","Scott Mushkin","And then, does that include or exclude the Memorial Day shift?","Rodney McMullen","That would include the shift of Memorial Day.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, that\u2019s perfect. So, you\u2019re at kind of a little below with the shift included. Okay, that\u2019s perfect. And then my big question, obviously you\u2019ve got a competitor, a large competitor making a lot of noise around price. So, have you seen anything in the marketplace where they\u2019ve gotten more competitive? And they have done and delivered what they said they are going to deliver as far as cleanliness and in stock. How seriously do you guys take their comments about several billion dollars of price investments? And they are even willing to take deflation in their own comps or kind of lower their own comps to get that done, and what\u2019s the plan at Kroger to kind of combat that if it ends up happening?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look, we take all competitors serious. So, to say we only focus on one, we really do look at all competitors. And we think it\u2019s incredibly important to make sure we focus on what our customer needs are. And as you know, if you look on annual basis, we are investing $3.6 billion on price today versus when we started on this new journey. So, we would have every intention to continue to maintain our price position. But, when you look at overall, the total customer, the way they look at value is much more than just price. And as you know, we stay focused on the total customer needs. And fresh products are incredibly important; what\u2019s the shopping experience; how long is the customer in line; how do they get treated by associates, all of those things are equally important. And we really are focused on continuing to improve all of those and we\u2019ve made substantial improvements in all of those. And a customer doesn\u2019t make a decision to shop where to shop based on only one dimension. And we think some of those other things create a very large competitive advantage for us.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, great. And then, I have one question. Obviously the ten-year bond has been falling quite steadily here for three or four months and then obviously has impacts on pensions. And I just want to get you guys\u2019 thoughts on this. We\u2019ve seen the drop like, 50, 60, 70 basis points something like that. And how should we think about pensions next year, and any framework there, Mike, on that if you think about this or no?","Mike Schlotman","Well, of course, I think about it. The effect of interest rate, it\u2019s really -- it\u2019s odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability use and the interest rate, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and several pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return as the discount rate. So, UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate, unless they change their expected rate of return. It\u2019s the same way -- the way it\u2019s mandated to be done. It would affect the Company plan a little bit but remember our Company plans are frozen plans. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and our participants in it, but there is no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough, so we don\u2019t have to do some reporting issues to participants. But, I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there is no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So, we purposely manage that to be slightly underfunded -- to be underfunded because someday rates will go up. And I don\u2019t want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in five years and have the fund be overfunded because I can\u2019t do anything with it.","Scott A. Mushkin","Any idea kind of a rule of thumb what the expected rate of returns on these -- on UFCW plans are and then our yield? Thanks.","Mike Schlotman","They\u2019re a little bit all over the board, I would say and the sevens [ph] is the most common; not a lot different than state and -- all the state, pension plan, they are all -- they all do it the same way.","Operator","And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Thank you for taking my question. Just on the topic of food inflation, deflation. This morning, the government data again showed a decline in food prices. So, I just want to get a sense what your latest full year outlook is and how you are thinking about the cadence, going forward?","Mike Schlotman","As I said in prepared remarks, we would have expected to start seeing a little bit more inflation right now than when we were sitting here three or four months ago thinking about it. And it just hasn\u2019t happened. And as I sit here today, it certainly doesn\u2019t feel like we are going to have the pickup in overall food inflation. Milk would have been projected to start having some cost increases but the federal market order on milk isn\u2019t showing any upward trend or not any significant upward trend. So, I think we are going to wind up most of the year in a fairly low inflationary environment.","Rodney McMullen","But, as Mike mentioned before, tonnage continues to improve; we\u2019re continuing to improve market share. If you look at year-on-year, we continue to improve the connection with the customer, and our gross profit dollars in departments remain strong as well. So, I think it\u2019s important to look at all these things together.","Rupesh Parikh","And then just going back to your comment here on traffic, if you look at traffic this past quarter versus recent quarters, has it improved? And if so, what\u2019s been some of the drivers do you believe behind the improvement?","Mike Schlotman","We have continued to see a strong growth in all households including loyal and non-loyals. I would go back to Rodney\u2019s prior comments on our never ending focus on the customer and making sure we understand what they want to figure out the way to deliver that with them while still having the right value propositions for them and our shareholders.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf","On food retail turning slightly deflationary, just to kind of echo Scott\u2019s question. Is that being driven at all by competitors taking pricing down even more so than the deflationary, just taking it down, try to get business going or is that all as far as you can tell or mainly as far as you can tell from the lower product cost?","Rodney McMullen","Almost all of it is the fresh department; it\u2019s the seafood, deli and all of those areas would be primarily driven by commodities. And then, if you look at in the grocery complex, milk would be a heavy deflation item; and that\u2019s as Mike mentioned before, really driven by the federal market. So, it\u2019s really -- it looks overall as for commodity based versus competition based. I don\u2019t know Mike, anything you\u2019d want to add to that?","Mike Schlotman","No, I absolutely agree.","Andrew Wolf","And on the guidance, keeping the ID sales the same as before but on lower inflation, obviously means you think the -- you are going to see improvement in volume. So, it sounds like volumes picked up a bit but what\u2019s sort of driving that outlook? Is it\u2026","Mike Schlotman","It\u2019s our expectation for the year. If you look at the first quarter, we delivered the 2.4% in exactly that kind of environment, and that was without the weather from the prior year and Memorial Day moving. So, we continue to focus on driving units, driving tonnage and making sure that the customer is getting the well rounded shopping experience that Rodney just spoke of.","Andrew Wolf","And if I could just get in a follow-up on ClickList, kind of a generic question on profitability. Is the current model -- let\u2019s say a volume -- store produces a reasonable amount of volume in ClickList, is that going to be as profitable as having a customer coming to store and pick their own groceries or does the model really have to shift to something that\u2019s scaled up or you can have a kind of a dedicated pick facility?","Rodney McMullen","When you\u2019re in the start-up period, obviously it\u2019s a headwind; there is more expense versus the other way. We certainly see that if you look at a model, we feel very comfortable the model can scale out to where from a profitability standpoint the customer can do either one and we are completely in different. One of the things that our team has done a lot of work on is trying to make sure we design a ClickList model that can scale to whatever the volume it scales to. So, if it is 5% of the business, we will do fine; at 5% if it becomes 20%, we will do fine at 20%. And our team really has done a lot of work to try to make sure we have designed a model that can scale and scale from a profitability standpoint, and the customer will lead us to where -- what percentage they want it to be.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan.","Ken Goldman","Is there any way to even roughly quantify the benefit of the Memorial Day shift on 2Q today, because you haven\u2019t really talked about that since 2004, and it\u2019s a long time ago? But from that we estimate maybe a shift like that can help roughly about 100 basis points on a quarter-to-date number. So I am just curious, is that roughly in the right range, meaning on a like for like basis you\u2019re doing maybe a bit below 2% so far in the quarter excluding the benefit from Memorial Day?","Rodney McMullen","I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll give you the exact number, but the 100 basis points isn\u2019t remotely correct. And don\u2019t forget, you have the week after as well and you really have to look at the two weeks together.","Ken Goldman","Not remotely correct meaning it\u2019s lower than 100 or higher, I am hoping lower?","Rodney McMullen","It\u2019s not even close to 100.","Mike Schlotman","Yes, you\u2019re not even in the right ballpark.","Ken Goldman","I\u2019ve never been so happy to be wrong, but I appreciate that.","Rodney McMullen","I am as well.","Mike Schlotman","And if that\u2019s impression that\u2019s out there, I\u2019ve never been so happy to help you be wrong.","Ken Goldman","Yes. That is the impression. So, we\u2019ll be smiling in the wrong house together. And then, I wanted to follow up on EPS, and forgive me if this was asked; I didn\u2019t hear it. Coming in closer to the bottom or the midpoint of the range, the reason that was cited was fuel. But you didn\u2019t -- unless I missed it, you didn\u2019t change your guidance for fuel margins coming in at or slightly below the five-year average. That was the same verb that you used last quarter. So, I just wasn\u2019t quite sure what actually changed that caused you to reduce the outlook?","Mike Schlotman","Fuel continues to be very volatile, and it certainly, again, I am sitting here in June trying to predict the rest of the year. And certainly seeing from what we see today that fuel will coming in at or below it, we pumped a couple of billion gallons of fuel in the first quarter and a very small change in that retail cents per gallon adds up to a lot of money very quickly. So, it\u2019s not like fuel has to change by $0.04 or defect our numbers in a big way. And it certainly seems that the trend would be closer to the below the five-year average than at the five-year average. But again, overall, it\u2019s really tough to predict. The last four days, the oil has gone down; is that going to leave the lower wholesale price of unleaded fuel? We\u2019ll know in the next few days.","Rodney McMullen","Plus the first quarter was slightly better than where we expected it to be. But when we look at the year, we really don\u2019t see the change.","Operator","The next question is from Zack Fadem of Wells Fargo.","Zack Fadem","Can we walk through some of the moving parts to the gross margin line in the quarter? With gross margin ex-fuel down slightly, can you talk about how things like deflation, price investments and the impact of Roundy\u2019s come into play here?","Mike Schlotman","I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll go down to that level of detail and walk through all the individual numbers. We continue to make the investments we plan to make in price throughout the first quarter. Certainly the dynamics of deflation, when you look at the whole gross profit margin for the entire Company, makes it kind of interesting, because as you have deflation, if you pass on exactly the lower cost of the customer, it drives your gross profit rate up; it\u2019s just simple math. Pharmacy continues to be a bit of a headwind to the gross profit numbers as well with some of the inflation in there and where the reimbursement rates are. So, it\u2019s just a really big mix bag; I would need several hours probably to point it.","Zack Fadem","Okay, we\u2019ll take that one offline then.","Mike Schlotman","Sorry to interrupt, but when you look at it overall, it\u2019s pretty close to where we expected it to be.","Rodney McMullen","And we executed our plan as Mike said.","Mike Schlotman","I absolute agree with that.","Zack Fadem","And just secondly, there has been a lot of talk about the online meal prep companies like Blue Apron. Have you considered expanding into this business? And if so, how you\u2019re thinking about it in terms of build versus buy?","Rodney McMullen","I want to answer it but I don\u2019t want t to sound flip. The short answer is absolutely. And as you can imagine, we would look at any and all approaches. The thing that\u2019s important is if we find somebody to make an investment and that they would value the leverage that we bring to the party as well and assign some value to that. So, it\u2019s not just something that has pure option value in the way they\u2019re getting valued. So, the short answer is yes. We would be very open to doing it on our own or doing it with somebody. And I think if you look at our track record, we\u2019ve had those approaches.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth","I wanted to dig in a little more on the Walmart question. We did a May price survey that was showing Walmart actually cutting in produce in two markets, cutting about 9%, and 5% to 6% cutting in another market. Are you seeing that in your view of marketplace? And do you think it really matters relative to your offering in produce since you have a broader offering and a little more robust?","Rodney McMullen","I don\u2019t know that I want to go in specifics because if you look at over the last say two years, you\u2019re going to find that type of variance among all retailers when you hit that specific market, and it\u2019s really which market are you looking at. So, I would hesitate to say there is something that\u2019s just fundamentally changing because you\u2019ll see those behaviors in specific markets all the time because any of us -- there maybe some market that we\u2019re trying to cause something to happen. If you look -- as you know for us, we have invested a ton of resources and labor improving the freshness of our products and especially in the produce department. And our customers are telling us, we\u2019re making meaningful improvements in what they see from a freshness standpoint in produce, specifically. We\u2019re getting the same thing in other departments but produce would be one to tell. And for us, it\u2019s really important the progress we\u2019re making to continue to make improvements from that. And as you know from an organic produce standpoint, we find that we have a outstanding variety of organic and customers continue to connect with that in a much deeper way.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. Inflation in produce in the first quarter was almost 400 basis points lower than the fourth quarter, still inflationary, but from fourth quarter to first quarter, it declined almost 400 basis points, less inflation.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. And Mike while we\u2019ve got you on, I wanted to ask about the buyback. You did like $1 billion of buyback here in the quarter. Do you anticipate more throughout the rest of the year; do you have any remaining in your buyback plan; and just give us some an update on where you\u2019re there?","Mike Schlotman","I currently have exhausted the authority the Board\u2019s given me. And if you look at our history, like to be with that authority for any particular point in time. And we have gotten a cadence over the last couple of years of frontend loading our buyback for the year. But we always want to have dry power, if the stock reacts in a way that we don\u2019t think is prudent based on our view of the underlying value of the Company.","Operator","Next we have a question from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","I actually wanted to -- two questions, one, I wanted to see if I could dig a little bit more into the inflation or deflation versus your outlook. Mike or Rodney, you guys have been talking about sort of good deflation versus demand driven deflation. Are you -- I just want to clarify, are you starting to see some demand driven deflation in your outlook that we should be concerned about? And maybe also -- it was helpful that you comment on milk and perishables. What\u2019s the center of store inflation outlook for you guys now; has that changed since you guys spoke to us last quarter? And then, I have a follow-up.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. I would say, it hasn\u2019t really changed very much other than it looks like it\u2019s going to come slower which could lead the less inflation for the full year by the time we get to the end of the year. And really as Rodney said earlier, everything we\u2019re seeing is really price led deflation, not demand driven. We haven\u2019t -- I am not sure -- trying to understand if your demand driven deflation on the fly here because the number we\u2019re talking about is what we pay for a product versus what we paid for it last year. So, I am not sure the demand would have to change rather dramatically in the marketplace for to affect grocery category. But everything we\u2019re seeing is just a little bit less inflation than we expected, right now, and it looks like that\u2019s going to persist.","Robby Ohmes","Thanks. And then, just one Roundy\u2019s, have you given us or can you give us a sort of rough, what do you think the rough impact on the FIFO operating margin is from Roundy\u2019s for this fiscal year? And just clarify, is that -- does it look like the amount you\u2019re going to have to invest in Roundy\u2019s including Mariano\u2019s, is that -- are you guys saying that\u2019s tracking right on plan or is that maybe going to be a little more than you initially thought? Any color on that would be great.","Rodney McMullen","If you look it overall, it\u2019s tracking on plan. I would say the thing that\u2019s taking a little longer than we would have expected is to get the actual things started. So, if you look at Wisconsin, obviously I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but on remodeling stores and making some of those changes, it took a little longer to get started than what we would have guessed. Now, why we thought we could have got it started it so quickly, I am not sure. And we\u2019ll learn that, so the next time we do something, because we\u2019re still doing it faster than what we could do within one of our historical Kroger divisions. The thing that I would say that I am extremely pleased with is our associates at Roundy\u2019s and how welcome they are and how excited they are to be part of the Kroger, and making sure that we leverage the size of Kroger. And the synergies continue to actually come in better than what we were expecting a little bit. But, as you know, we\u2019ll continue to invest those synergies into driving our business. Mike, you work on it closer than I do.","Mike Schlotman","No, I agree, and I disagree with Rodney\u2019s comment, I\u2019m not sure why we were as bullish as we were being able to get remodel started, because with an early termination of HSR filling, the time from announcement to close was very quick, and then you had the holidays, because we closed on December 18. And it just takes a while to get plans drawn, get sign off on how we\u2019re going to remodel the stores and things like that. But I can -- you can rest assured that if you found the right part of Wisconsin to go to, you would see a lot of activity going on in and around a lot of stores today.","Robby Ohmes","And for Mariano\u2019s, are changes that you plan there, either do assortment or anything else, is that may be running a little bit slower than initially hoped for?","Rodney McMullen","On Mariano\u2019s, there really isn\u2019t much of a focus on assortment, there may be some products that if the team in Chicago asks for, we\u2019ll obviously give them access to it, will start carrying it. But, in Mariano\u2019s, the focus is continuing to build more stores. And I think, this year, we\u2019ll end up opening four or five stores in Chicago on the base of 30 some stores, so very aggressive capital plan there.","Operator","And next we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning everyone, nice quarter. I would like to take a -- not a crack at that question about the economy but not so much about how the U.S. economy is growing or slowing or whatever the case might be, but really looking at customer behavior, as they all look at some of these fresh departments and experience lower prices. What are you seeing between say types of protein; are we seeing trading between those categories simply because people are more impressed with a lower price than they were last year?","Rodney McMullen","There is no doubt that you see people like in beef, buying more beef, things like that. So, those things are definitely happening. But some of those prices are the best prices that customers would have seen in, I want to say, almost three years, just reflecting back. So how much of it is driven because of economy and how much of it\u2019s just driven because it is a great -- it\u2019s a good value, again, given the changes in price. Mike you were looking at some details.","Mike Schlotman","I absolutely agree with what Rodney said. And if you look at the meat category in particular, until we got into late 2015 and in 2014, you had -- in the early part of \u201814 you had mid to single digits inflation, ended 2014 with double-digit inflation. Last year started off high and then as we got into the third or fourth quarter, the prices really started coming down. And it\u2019s people buying, perhaps buying more and people coming back into the categories what\u2019s driving it there.","Operator","The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us sense of just the overall competitive promotional environment in both conventional as well as natural and organic, how is it today versus what you saw in the quarter versus the prior quarter. And more specifically, have you seen any impact from all these in California?","Mike Schlotman","Again, we won\u2019t go into specific competitors or geographies but we always assume the environment around that it\u2019s going to get more competitive when we build the business plan. If you happen to have a year where that\u2019s not the case, that just makes the year a little bit better. But the industry has always been very competitive. And we see no, nothing out there that would cause it to be less competitive. And we go in every year with that assumption and build a business plan of how we can invest the dollars we have to invest for our customers\u2019 benefit to drive more tonnage and more trips to the store and increase loyal households. And as we continue to do that, you see the results as the number of our loyal households continue to grow, their trips to the stores continue to grow, and then the units they buy on a monthly or quarterly basis, continue to grow. And that really winds up being our focus. As Rodney said early on, competition and pricing environment. We don\u2019t ignore anybody; we know what they are doing, but we always come back to what\u2019s our customer wanting and how can we satisfy that need.","Alvin Concepcion","Got it, thank you and just as my follow-up. Wondering how we should think about the puts and takes to margins over the next few quarters. I know fuel margins are big impact but how much of an impact do you expect from things like the overtime legislation and are you fully EMV compliant at this point?","Mike Schlotman","We\u2019re EMV compliant where you have to be EMV compliant. The sea stores and fuel pumps and things like that have a different deadline to be implemented. Some of our merged companies aren\u2019t completely there yet because they started later than we had started, and we are working to get them caught up. But, if you at pre -- if you look at, Roundy\u2019s has some work to do on EMV compliance, relatively small piece of the total pie. So, those things weren\u2019t -- won\u2019t affect. What was the first part of your?","Rodney McMullen","On the labor changes, we would not have very many management people that would be below the new minimum wage. We are going through and understand exactly how it will impact us. But a rough guess, on an annualized basis, it\u2019s probably right now our guess would be 15 million to 20 million for the whole year. So, in the overall scheme of things, it\u2019s not a lot. But, we are still in the process of making sure what\u2019s the best approach for all our associates, but we don\u2019t have that many people that make less than that.","Operator","The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania","I wanted to circle back on Roundy\u2019s. It seems like their performance there was better than maybe your expectation. And just curious what drove that. Was that Wisconsin markets or Chicago? And do you think that 30 basis points -- are you looking for that 30 basis points drag for the next couple of quarters or do you think that could continue to improve, any color there?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, I would think the 30 basis points is what it\u2019ll wind up affecting the full year by. They continue to have obviously with it being a headwind, their sales trends are below the rest of the Company. It\u2019s not like flipping a switch and all of a sudden you put a program and they are done. We are going about this in a very methodical way for lack of a better world of making sure the stores are cleaned up, making sure the reset, making sure stores are remodeled that need to be remodeled, some may wind up being relocated. And then you step back and you figure out how to get the best value proposition to their customers, like we have done pre merger with Roundy\u2019s. So, the good news is this is a game plan that we have used before, as we invested in growing -- taking the business who had sluggish sales in Kroger at the turn of the century to a company that has very robust sales, and it\u2019s a strategy we would expect and implement in Wisconsin as we go throughout the year. But it won\u2019t be flipping to switch where all of sudden they\u2019ll turn on a dime.","Rodney McMullen","And if you look at our overall Roundy\u2019s strategy, when we announced the merger, we really look at as a three-year approach. And obviously some of the things that we\u2019ve talked about as part of it but as Mike just mentioned, our real estate would be part of that remodeling stores, expanding stores, all of those things would be part of the total package. One of the reasons why we got excited about Roundy\u2019s was obviously Mariano\u2019s but in addition to that in Wisconsin, the quality the real estate, most of the real estate to have there is very good location and for the most part good store sites as well.","Kelly Bania","Then, just wanted to ask, when you look at your households, your increasing penetration with new households in particular, I am wondering if you have any color on what kind of customer that you are getting there that new customers, is that higher income customer or lower income customer, is it at diverse group, any analyses that you\u2019ve done around that would be helpful.","Rodney McMullen","It is very diverse. And if you look, it would certainly be heavily weighted the mainstream and it scales from that. So it is diverse from ethnic diversity, it\u2019s diverse from income diversity, and it\u2019s diverse from age, which for us we obviously get excited by being in all of those groups.","Kelly Bania","And then one, just last one on the fuel margins for Mike. Is it fair to say $0.01 swing in the gas margin could be around $0.05 to the EPS, is that rough ballpark way to think about it?","Mike Schlotman","I actually don\u2019t have that calculation handy.","Rodney McMullen","For the year that would be close.","Mike Schlotman","Yes, for a quarter, -- as Rodney said, for the year, it would be fairly\u2026","Kelly Bania","For the year?","Mike Schlotman","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Mike, just a quick question on your view of the refinancing market right now; it looks like you had about $1.2 billion in CP and you have $100 million maturing later this year. So, I just wanted to get your view on continuing to use the CP market to roll some of your maturities versus terming them out in terms of a long-term market, given where rates are? Thank you.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. We do have the $800 million later this year and 500, a little over 500 million in January. What the reason -- I would see as that matures, terming that out, as it comes closer, we have been putting interest rate hedges on that debt through our time to take some of the interest rate risk off of the table if rates got to way from us quickly. Relative to commercial paper, you will probably us maintain commercial paper in that range. It\u2019s the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today; it\u2019s the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it\u2019s easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term them out. If I have swaps or hedges or if I\u2019ve done a three or five-year floating rate note, you really can\u2019t change that quickly or eloquently. So that will continue to be part of our strategy.","Priya Ohri-Gupta","Thank you very much.","Mike Schlotman","And we probably have time for one more question.","Operator","And that final question will come from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research.","Ajay Jain","Actually most of my questions have been asked already. My question is on Roundy\u2019s. Obviously, it\u2019s early in your experience there, but since last year\u2019s fourth quarter was a stub period and now you\u2019ve got one full quarter under your belt, I am just wondering if you seen any change sequentially in Roundy\u2019s operating performance sequentially, are you seeing any change there that\u2019s meaningful?","Mike Schlotman","Again, it\u2019s in the ballpark of what we expected them to be. We have, as Rodney said, if there is anything on Roundy\u2019s of note from us, internally it\u2019s just that we had a little bit higher expectations of how quickly we could do some of the things that have taken a little bit longer than we expected. But, we do have some momentum going now.","Ajay Jain","And, I think you mentioned and Rodney you mentioned things took a little longer to get started in Milwaukee. But can you also maybe comment on how you view the challenges for Roundy\u2019s in Chicago compared to Milwaukee? Obviously they\u2019re very different formats and different customer demographics. But to the extent that there is any real variability in terms of how those markets are performing, can you speak to that at all?","Rodney McMullen","In Chicago, it\u2019s completely different. Obviously the condition of the store base is substantially very, very good, most of the stores. The first store was opened in 2010. They had acquired a bunch of stores from Dominick\u2019s when Dominick\u2019s left the market; they\u2019re in the process of remodeling those stores. But the rest of the stores are in very good condition. The biggest thing in Chicago is just cycling a lot of sister store impacts because there were so many incremental new stores because of the Dominick\u2019s acquisition. But it\u2019s really -- the focus there is to continue to execute the plan, continue to connect deeper with customers and grow our market share. And Chicago is a fantastic market that we really like.","Ajay Jain","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you. Before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. And as you know, I always like to tell our associates a few comments because we just have so many that listen in. And first, I want to take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the recent horrific attack in Orlando. What happened is tragic and heartbreaking. I also want to thank the first responders, who put their lives in danger every day to protect us. I know our family of associates those at Axium Healthcare outside of Orlando, across Florida and throughout the rest of the country is deeply saddened by what has happened. We stand in support of the LGBT community. An event like this affects each and every one of us, no matter where we live or work. It serves to remind us of what is most important and that is taking care of each other. I want to thank our associates everywhere who demonstrate our values of diversity, inclusion and respect every day to treat all with dignity; to seek and embrace the differences among people; and to lift each other up.","That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us and have a good summer.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

My name is Colby, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Cindy Holmes","Thank you, Colby. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2013 investor conference to be held in New York in October. We will provide details later this year and look forward to seeing many of you then. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","The year is off to a great start. In the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share. In our investor conference last October, we outlined our long-term strategy and strategic and capital investment plans, which included expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate.","Based upon these plans, our positive identical store sales growth for the last 9 years plus, and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and 2012, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance to 8% to 11% plus an increasing dividend. These first quarter results give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering...","[Technical Difficulty]","I'm sure we're live. Are we back on? We must be. Okay, so let me continue. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis. I am very proud of our associates for delivering another quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We're connecting with our customers better than ever before, and their positive view of Kroger continues to improve.","Our associates also did an outstanding job of keeping costs down this quarter. We continue to find our cost savings in places that do not negatively impact our customer shopping experience so that we can reinvest those savings in ways that create lasting customer loyalty. As a result of this cycle, we achieved our 38th consecutive quarter of positive identical store sales growth. Our solid operating performance continues to support our plans to increase capital investment to grow our business over time.","We continue to monitor how 4 factors are affecting consumer confidence: the overall state of the economy, fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty. While there are signs of a better economy, the improvement is not robust. Customer sentiment is gradually improving but remains fragile. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks.","Overall, we are confident that we will meet the targets we committed to in October, both now and in the future. We've raised our fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance to reflect this confidence.","Rodney will now provide additional details about our first quarter business performance. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on our long-term growth strategy. We continue to narrow our focus on new markets for future expansion and to add square footage in several fill-in markets.","Fort Wayne, Indiana is a good example of where we've done this successfully. Over the last several years, we've upgraded our position in the market by investing in new stores and remodels, completing an acquisition and making incremental investments in our people through training and leadership development. As a result, we have doubled our market share in Fort Wayne over the last 5 years. We view this as a successful pilot and are well underway with similar strategies in several other markets.","A key growth metric of our business is identical sales because it provides the best measure of our growing relevance with customers over time. We are very pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3.3% without fuel. This is even better when you look at identical sales without fuel and pharmacy. On this basis, our identical sales grew to 4% versus 3.2% on a comparable basis last year.","Sales growth in the first quarter was driven by loyal household growth, more visits per household and increases in prices per unit. In addition to visiting our stores more frequently, customers continue to buy more on a monthly basis. Items per basket were slightly up on a per trip basis and a monthly basis. As a result, total units sold was up solidly compared to last year.","During the first quarter, we grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. Our loyal household growth count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.","The product cost inflation is estimated at 1.7%, excluding fuel. Every store department had inflation, with the exception of seafood, which had deflation.","Our pharmacy business has undergone a lot of change in the last 18 months, and we are thrilled with where we are. The amount of Express Scripts volume that we have -- the amount of Express Scripts volume we retained. As expected, the effect of generics continued in the first quarter, which I described earlier, affected identical sales by 70 basis points. Even with these headwinds, our pharmacy team continues to deliver outstanding performance, including solidly positive script count growth.","I want to echo Dave's earlier comment that our associates did a great job controlling costs in the first quarter. OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 21 basis points as a percent of sales.","Now I'd like to update you on the progress in corporate brand. As we said last quarter, our practice had been to disclose our corporate brand share in the grocery category only. Given the breadth of our corporate brand offerings, we are now comfortable to give you a view of our share across the whole store, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","On this broader basis, corporate brands represented approximately 26% of total units sold, up 30 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Total corporate brand sales dollars were 23.7%, also up 30 basis points compared to the same period last year.","We continue to see impressive growth in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands. We are regularly adding new items. In fact, we plan to launch 75 new items between now and the end of this year, and today, offer 450 honest, easy and affordable Simple Truth options for our customers. And by the way, they're great.","We also continue to make progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operation. Next week, we will publish our seventh Annual Sustainability Report. As a preview, I'd like to highlight some of the -- our most successful initiatives of 2012.","We have reduced total store energy usage by 32.7% since the year 2000. We also reduced our carbon footprint and made significant progress toward our goal of 0 waste. 21 of our 37 manufacturing plants have now achieved the impressive goal of sending 0 waste to landfills. I'd like to thank our associates for bringing all these initiatives to life through their individual actions each and every day. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live.","Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified a series of new labor agreements, covering stores in Michigan, Houston, Indianapolis, plus Fred Meyer and QFC stores in Oregon. We have many contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Roanoke, Seattle, and later this year in Cincinnati and Dallas.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.","Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective. Growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.","Now Mike will provide more detail on Kroger's first quarter financial results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.4% to $30 billion in the first quarter compared with $29.1 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.8% in the first quarter over the same period last year.","Net earnings for the first quarter totaled $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share. Net earnings for the first quarter of last year were $439 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Several factors contributed to this great result, including strong operations, lower LIFO expense, lower share count and partially offset by our higher effective tax rate this year.","FIFO gross margin was 20.65% of sales for the first quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 15 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $17 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $46 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year.","We were pleased to deliver on our goal to grow FIFO operating margin in the first quarter. First quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $47 million over the prior year. Excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012, on a rolling 4 quarters basis, FIFO operating margin increased 11 basis points.","On a rolling 4 quarter 52-week basis, return on invested capital was 13.5% compared to 13.4% during the same period last year. We are committed to growing our ROIC over time, even with the higher level of capital spending.","Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers margin per gallon was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.121 in the same quarter last year. As it relates to retails per gallon in all fuel outlets, they averaged $3.52 in this quarter compared to $3.65 last year. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.","Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: Maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments. You will notice on our balance sheet that the current portion of long-term debt has increased, and our net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.85.","As it relates to the current portion of long-term debt, we made the conscious decision to fund out our first quarter maturities using the historically low interest rates available in the commercial paper market. Since we have hedged the expected financings, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates has been mitigated.","The lower-than-expected net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was primarily a result of our stock's recent performance, which took us out of the market for share repurchases based on the 10b5-1 we had [ph] in place at the time. As you know, we modify our grid from time to time. We currently have $447 million remaining on our board authorization and believe that repurchases in the current range are attractive.","During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 4.5 million common shares for a total investment of $146 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters.","Capital investment totaled $646 million for the first quarter compared to $557 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full-year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.","Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. Based on the first quarter results, we increased our net earnings guidance range to $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. Our original guidance was $2.71 to $2.79 per diluted share. The company's long-term growth rate guidance is 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.","The calculation of our growth rate for fiscal 2013 is based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, as was shown in Table 6 of the fourth quarter press release. Adjustments include the UFCW consolidated pension plan lability, the credit card settlement and the extra week.","As you look at our expectations for the year, please keep in mind the guidance we gave in March for the fourth quarter. On a 12-week basis, we still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the fourth quarter last year. This is because we currently expect a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter this year compared to a credit of $41 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Kroger continues to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal year 2013.","Now I will turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Mike. I understand that at the beginning of the call, several of you were not able to hear our opening comments. And so I know that a lot of the purpose of this call is to give you a sense of how we felt about the quarter. So I'm going to go back and repeat just a little bit of what I think you may have missed.","The most important part you missed was the stunning oratory that Cindy offered of the forward-looking statement caution. But that, rather than read that you, I just want to you know that is posted online so you can find that there.","But the other paragraph that you missed was my initial comments about how I felt about the quarter, and so I want to read those to you, they're important. I said that this year is off to a great start. And in the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share.","In our investor conference this last October, we outlined our long-term strategy, our strategic and capital investment plans, which include expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate. Based upon these plans, our positive identical sales growth for more than 9 years and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and '12, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance from 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend.","These first quarter results that we're here to talk about today give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term earnings guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis.","So with that background, before I turn to questions, I want to close with these observations. I'm very proud of the Kroger team's relentless focus on delivering on our Customer 1st strategy quarter after quarter. It's what sets us apart from competition. Our customers' positive view of Kroger continues to improve, and they are rewarding us with their loyalty.","We achieved strong sales and record earnings per share for the quarter, controlled costs and delivered on our goal to improve FIFO operating margin. The momentum coming out of the first quarter will continue to drive growth and greater shareholder value. So now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things. First, did the first quarter come in a little bit better than you guys had planned in light of sort of the quarterly breakdown Mike had given on the last call? If that's true, what may have driven the upside in your mind? And then I know on the last call, Mike, you'd also -- you'd talked about the second and third quarter being up toward the high end of your long-term range. Are those still about right or has anything changed there?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, the second and third quarter guidance would remain unchanged, and we didn't call that out in the prepared comments. I focused only on the fourth quarter. Just to make sure everybody remembered that's what we said about the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter, yes, it came out a little better than we expected. Sales were a little stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, so I would say it was primarily a sales-driven beat in the first quarter, and just as well was great execution at store level from a cost control standpoint as well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, as you think about market share, maybe for Dave and Rodney, when you think about market share, and we give the Fort Wayne example, have you yet had a market, and I'm not sure if it would be Cincinnati or Denver or one of those, a market where you've not been able to increase share, you've hit a natural ceiling. And then when you think about the incremental margin attached to that, does that -- as you get to certain points of share, whether it be 30 or 35 or whatever, does the incremental margin sort of step up, up to a certain point and then flatten out, or how do you think about the economics of that?","David B. Dillon","Well, I'm sure there's some point of diminishing returns, but I don't think we found it yet. And I think we're pleased that at any of the historical references we would have to look at market share, we're not going talk about specific markets in that regard, but we have plenty of examples, some of which you've already listed, that illustrate well how that strategy will work. Rodney, you want to add anything to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","The only thing I would add is one of the things that we continue to expand some of the things we offer in a market, too. So if you look at the core grocery business, you may start getting a cap there or a diminishing return. But one of the things that we've had, and we've had very good results that help our return on investment, is expanding some of the things we're offering. So in some of the markets that you gave examples of, if you look at our marketplace store, we're finding we are getting good returns by expanding what we offer to the customer.","David B. Dillon","That's a really good point because it is a dynamic marketplace, and things will change over time, and even when you think you've hit a peak, you just push yourself to find additional either products or services or remodel the stores or approach the stores differently. It's just a dynamic place.","W. Rodney McMullen","And we do -- every time we do an investment project, we look at the incremental effect that it has on surrounding stores to make sure that their incremental return is there. And so it becomes store specific on each individual investment decision.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. But I guess you haven't hit a peak yet in share as far as you can tell in any market, right?","W. Rodney McMullen","Not that we can tell.","David B. Dillon","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I would like to just understand a little bit your sales guidance. You're still maintaining the 2.5% to 3.5%, although you hit close to the high end. And I would have thought that generics would have been a particularly negative impact on the first quarter, probably even through the whole first half, and then I think fuel prices were down a little bit. So are you being just very conservative, or is there something about sales for the next 3 quarters that make you believe that you'll stay no more than this range?","W. Rodney McMullen","It's really just so early in the year, and it's just having 1\/4 of the year over with. Obviously, so far, we're very pleased with our sales. We continue to strive to be in the top part of that range. We continue to strive to be there. But I would say the biggest thing is it's just early in the year, and it felt too early to change guidance on that given all the uncertainty that's going on in the marketplace.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, I understand that. I guess, I just would like to ask a little bit about inflation. 1.7% is not an excessively moderate number. I don't know what the trends have looked like. And a concern often is that if inflation gets to be moderate enough, some retailers could end up with negative comps, and you could see a heightening of the competitive environment. Are you seeing anything like that anywhere, or is there any reason to be concerned about that?","David B. Dillon","Meredith, I'll have Mike maybe comment on inflation and then Rodney on the competitive environment. But the inflation we saw in the first quarter was very similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter. And while there's a little push and take in what department it fell in, it was very similar and quite moderate. So you want to comment on where you see inflation, anything else you want to add, Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","No, I think inflation in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be, and it's essentially in line with what we baked in to our expectations for the year.","W. Rodney McMullen","And certainly from a competitive standpoint, we don't see huge changes. As you know, we always try to make sure we stay flexible to deal with competitive changes as they happen. But so far, we haven't seen really any change going on.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. I guess my just one other question would be about your investments in new stores in maybe new markets or adjacent markets. Is there anything in terms of what's happening with competitors or the real estate market that make you feel better or worse about the ability to generate a good return from those new investments?","David B. Dillon","I think the decision more rides upon our confidence in what we're doing. And I think it's somewhat independent. I mean, I suppose there's some outside factors that could cause you to go a different direction. But more than anything, it's really focused on what we do well and what we have confidence that we can continue to do well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Krueger.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dave, could you discuss the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in Q2 and how underlying -- I guess, underlying volume is probably the same since inflation is the same, but could you just give a little bit color there?","David B. Dillon","Sure. I'll describe what I think I recall and Beth will correct me if I'm wrong because she's sitting here with me. But earlier in the quarter, let's say through the first half or even 2\/3 of the way through the quarter was a little stronger than at the tail end of the quarter. But we still ended up happy and strong at the end of the quarter. And then so far, after 3.5 weeks, we've seen IDs without fuel to be very similar to what they were in the first quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen","The other thing worth mentioning is just Easter.","David B. Dillon","Yes, that's true.","W. Rodney McMullen","The comment early in the quarter is certainly true. Then when you look midway through the quarter, it's a little harder to see because Easter was earlier this year than last year. So some of the cycling of the change in Easter also affected the cadence during the quarter.","David B. Dillon","Yes, I think we -- I'd tell you the same caution I tell ourselves is don't try to overread it because -- the first quarter in particular, because of that Easter phenomenon. Every year, we're in this no man's land of trying to read, are you happy or not happy with your sales? And the week before Easter, the week after Easter and a few of the days surrounding either direction of that have a big impact on how you're going to feel. So I wouldn't overread it.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. My next question for you is on the gross margin. Historically, there seems, like our perception at least into the markets, is there has been more volatility in your gross margin quarter-to-quarter. Whereas you may see an opportunity to make an investment, it's probably hurt sort of investor perception of the company historically. But more recently, it felt a little bit more consistent. And I guess the question really is, has there been any change in the way you sort of think about running the company in terms of the investments that you're making in margin and the volatility around that in terms of you trying to take advantage of different opportunities?","David B. Dillon","Well, I think you're well aware that we try to look at this on an annual basis. However, we have also tried to be a little more consistent and conscious of the way in which a quarter might appear, so that we don't end up doing something abrupt in 1 quarter and wishing we hadn't done that, and then the next quarter have to go the other direction. So we have been a little bit more careful ourselves. We also have learned a little bit better how to pace ourselves on those kinds of investments, so that's helped. Rodney, you may want to comment a little bit on just how you see gross generally in the quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, I would agree with the comments Dave made. One of the things that, over the last several years, we've worked really hard to make sure that we understand what cost reductions we're getting and trying to make sure that we manage our gross investments, tying in and getting costs out. I would say that probably our internal estimation systems, we feel they're of a little higher quality in terms of giving us really better estimates in terms of what we're seeing on taking costs out because of our operations team and our finance team working together, which then, in turn, makes it a little easier to balance that with selling gross changes too.","David B. Dillon","Now one thing you ought to recognize, too, is that the moderation you saw in the first quarter was at least, in part, helped by the gross margin in pharmacy. Rodney commented on that in his prepared remarks, that pharmacy, because of the change to generics, has -- the sales dollars are down, our script count is terrific, but the effect on gross, it tends to flip it a little bit because the gross margin has been improved. Rodney you want to comment...","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, yes, I was just going to say the change in pharmacy made a huge effect in the total numbers. So if you look at the individual pieces, it would have actually been a little more than what it appears on the total.","David B. Dillon","And I thought that's important for you to know, but that was still on a very planned basis. I mean, we knew exactly where pharmacy was headed, and I could see that completely coming. So it wasn't a surprise to us at all.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And one very quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, is your SG&A comparison in the second quarter as difficult as it looks? Dollars weren't -- not up much last year. Should we consider that in the model?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I don't think it's something you should be overly concerned with. I can't think of anything that we're facing right now as compared to the prior year. And it's -- our expectations for the quarter are certainly baked into our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A few quarters ago, you had such, I guess, intense promotional spending from your vendors who sell branded food that your share of private label actually went down temporarily. I'm curious, I guess, if you can update us on the promotional dynamic today among your branded vendors in general. And the reason I'm asking is we're seeing some data today from Nielsen that would suggest maybe a broader number of grocery items sold on promotion today, but we're not seeing either way how deep some of those discounts are. So I guess I'm just curious for any color on the promotional dynamic overall among your grocery vendors.","David B. Dillon","I'll see if Rodney wants to give you specifics, but before he does, I would just say the keyword you used was dynamic. And you should think of this as changing all the time, I mean, every month, every quarter. So I don't know that we're going to be able to identify a clear pattern for you. But Rodney, you have any comments on that?","W. Rodney McMullen","I mean, if you just look at over a long period of time, private label or corporate brands have continued to gain share. Usually, what happens is some CPGs will make more money than they should be because the raw material costs haven't increased. And that always provides a huge umbrella for corporate brands to gain share, which happens. Then, the CPGs will get a little more aggressive with promotional dollars, which will bring it back down. But what we find is very seldom does the share ever go back to where it was before. There is a permanent loss when CPGs do that. So it is, as Dave mentioned, it's a dynamic process, but we -- overall, we think that's one of the really important reasons and critical for us to have such a strong corporate brand program that connects with customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Could you guys just talk about, I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on rates. If rates -- and I guess, Mike, you could -- maybe you can answer this. If rates back up another 50 or 100 basis points, what's going to be the overall impact on your expenses, say, over the next year or 2? Will that actually be a net positive since it could take certain expenses, such as pensions, down a little bit?","J. Michael Schlotman","It'll have some marginal effect on the funded status of my corporate plan. Keep in mind that all the UFCW funds that we participate in actually present value their lability at the expected rate of return, not current interest rate, so it really won't have any affect on my UFCW funded status. And the contributions to those funds are dictated by a contractual obligation anyway, not necessarily an exact funded status. So I don't really see any effect on my operating expenses as it relates to the backup in rates. Even the -- it's interesting to talk about a 2.4% 10-year treasury or so as the backup in rates because it's still a historically low treasury rate. And even if I had to refinance the debt I have coming due at these rates, I still wind up leveraging down the weighted average cost of my debt portfolio. So I'm still comfortable we're going to be able to execute the financial strategy we have. Plus, as I said earlier in my prepared comments, we've actually been utilizing the -- our commercial paper availability rather than accessing the market because we've been able to borrow at such low rates. And it helped the first quarter probably by $0.005. So I don't really see a huge positive or negative at this point from where rates are.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just a question on the fuel rewards program. Have you guys made any significant changes to the fuel rewards promotions, particularly as more and more competitors roll out these similar programs?","W. Rodney McMullen","We would continually offer different promotions on fuel rewards, things like that. But it -- it's one of the nice things about being first in the market. It continues to connect extremely well with our customers and especially our oil customers. But there's always different offers that you'll do in a specific market from time to time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Dave, I think I've asked you this before, but when you mentioned the variability of sales, not too surprising given some changes in payroll taxes and so on, but has -- or are you trying to tell us the amplitude? Or has that gotten worse, better or stayed the same?","David B. Dillon","I'd say it's about like it had been, that in short-term periods for like a day or a week, often unpredictable, but there's a reasonably clear pattern we've seen once you extend the time period to go to a period or a quarter. So yes, I'd say it's pretty much like what we've been seeing. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","The only thing that I would add and this is if you look at electronic benefit transfers, states continue to change the days that the dollars go out on benefits, which also causes some of the variability. And you don't know how much of that variability is just because of that change or how much of it is broader than just that change.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. So obviously, when it's smoothed out over a quarter or what have you, things are fine. Your IDs are excellent. But how about operationally? I mean, are you trying to say it's harder to set store hours because it's harder to predict who's coming in what day?","W. Rodney McMullen","It certainly is harder to make sure you stay in stock. And I think our teams are doing a great job doing that, but it does -- any type of variability obviously makes it a little more complicated to manage against.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And I also wanted to follow up just on the guidance. You were above your internal expectations and then raised guidance a little bit. So is that -- I just want to underline this or ask you to underline this. Is that more what you're seeing out there either with the consumer or with pricing and competition? Or is it -- it just it -- is it just it's early yet and you just don't want to raise guidance more than you might want -- at this juncture raise guidance more than you did?","J. Michael Schlotman","No, I think we're comfortable with the guidance we gave and it's where we believe we'll wind up on the year. Obviously, we raised the low end a little more than the high end, and that's because of the strength of the first quarter. We think that the low, the potential low end will be better than we originally thought. And I do want to remind folks that the fourth quarter, we do, as we sit here today, on a 12-week, 12-week basis, expect that to be behind because of the LIFO swing. And that's in our numbers, but not necessarily in everybody else's numbers.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Fair enough. And I understand about the guidance. I guess your guidance is your guidance. But I guess I'm trying to say is -- was there any change during the quarter or now, competitively or with the consumer, that has changed your thinking on the year?","J. Michael Schlotman","I think relative to what we see for the rest of the year, we remain committed to what our original guidance was. And we tried to compare to our original expectations. And we flowed that through our annual expectations, and we're comfortable what we -- with what we see from our original expectations for the rest of the year.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And this is probably for Rodney. Rodney, in the past, when you -- people ask you about M&A, you said a lot of the chains don't pencil out because their pricing in the market's too high. Now as I think about the portfolio of banners at Kroger, you actually run some high end and low end, such as Food 4 Less and Quality Foods, one which goes at a discount versus conventionals, one that goes at a premium. So how do you view -- when things come up in the marketplace that are either discount or premium type banners that are for sale, how do you view looking at their relative pricing? Do you still want it to be in line with the market, which you would, I guess, for typical conventional? Or do you adjust that thinking for the type of banner that you're -- that is out there in the marketplace?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. I won't give any insight into how we actually analyze any opportunity that comes up. We -- as we've said historically, we look at a lot of things when they come up, act on a very little of that, and actually, when I say act, make an offer on very little of that, and have a deal come to fruition even on less assets than that. If you look at our pattern over the last several years, we continue to be very happy with the fill-in acquisitions we've done. But to give specifics on how we might look at a particular group of stores, I just don't see any upside in going down that path.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with Merrill Lynch.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just curious on private label now. You mentioned some changes into how you're measuring the units and the dollars in that category. Can you remind us or let us know what categories are now in there? And then I guess related to that, how do you think about the Simple Truth line and shelf space there? I guess what I'm wondering, is there opportunity to add more? It sounds like it still continues to go very well.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. If you look at the private label share that I outlined, it includes all the departments except for fuel and pharmacy, so it would include produce, meat, seafood, drug\/GM, plus the grocery categories that we've always done in the past. So it's the complete store excluding pharmacy and fuel. Those things we thought would be a little complicated because we're not -- the generic drugs, do you put it as private label or not, and then obviously, fuel, we sell all our fuel unbranded. So that's what's included in the market share and the unit share that I talked about. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit in terms of if you look at shelf space, the model that we use to determine whether an item gets on the shelf is exactly the same for our corporate brands as it is for national brands, because we don't want -- we want to make sure, from a customer standpoint, the same dynamic is driving the location on a shelf and the item itself, whether it even gets on the shelf. The accountability for that has to be the same for our corporate brands just like a national brand. In terms of Simple Truth, it's been obviously a huge home run. It's connected really well with our customers. Because of that, it -- the brand itself is earning more shelf space, and we continue to find new items that will fit nicely into that Free From 101 different ingredients and Simple Truth Organic. So it's working really well, but it's earning its way there because of the connection with our customer.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's very helpful. And then if I could just follow up with one more question on gas. It looks like your gas margin came in a little bit lower for the quarter year-over-year, and I'm just wondering if you can remind us how you're planning that segment for the year in terms of profitability. And then just remind us, you mentioned that half of your stores, roughly half your stores have the gas offering. Is there much trend -- difference in trend in traffic or IDs right now, particularly with gas prices a little bit lower right now year-over-year?","David B. Dillon","Mike, you want to address that?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, when you look at fuel, any one quarter can be somewhat volatile on fuel margins in retails, which is why we talked about that. Relative to what we saw in the first quarter compared to our expectations for the year, I would say the first quarter wasn't that far out of the ballpark when you look at the comparisons of the numbers that we talked about at the supermarkets. They weren't wildly different, and it's clearly something that, as I said, we expect fuel to be a contributor to the overall growth of the company. Fuel earned a little bit less in the first quarter than it earned last year in the first quarter, but we experience that from time to time, and my guess is there'll be a period of time this year where it earns more from year-to-year. Relative to the -- why we put them at the fuels -- at our supermarkets essentially, it's just one more thing that we can solve a convenience for and offer a value to the customer, where, when they're already at our store and they come to -- our most loyal customers come to our stores 2, 3 or 4 times a week, and they have the availability of fuel there along with the fuel rewards, it's an incremental reason for them to want to come to Kroger versus a competitor. And it's clearly part of the overall value proposition our customers see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry, if there's background noise here. I'm on the road, and once I ask it, I'll mute. Could you quantify the gross margin impact from the pharmacy? Could you also talk about the impact on gross margins from ending the double couponing in many of your banners? And then actually the follow-up to the last question, if you could actually quantify the difference in same-store sales for your stores with and without fuel stations?","W. Rodney McMullen","In terms of the gross margin effect from pharmacy, I won't break it out separately. It was a meaningful number, but I won't break it out separately. On double coupons, we invested the monies that were saved from double coupons into lower everyday pricing. So if you look in total, it actually had no effect on gross margin. Because what we found was there wasn't very many customers actually engaged with double coupons, and we felt like it was better to give lower prices to all customers, so all customers could get the benefit of that. So it really didn't affect much. And then identical sales with and without fuel locations, that, obviously for competitive reasons, we have not shared and wouldn't think it's appropriate to share at this point either.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the gross margin for the pharmacy, the impact, if I put out a number, will you say if that makes sense or not? Kind of in the 20- to 30-basis-point range as a positive in that result?","W. Rodney McMullen","I won't. I don't know whether, Dave or Mike, if there's any insights that you can help -- that you would think Jason could find helpful.","David B. Dillon","No, I don't think there's anything else to add other than I don't think you would find the quarter and the variations and stuff to be unusual. The only thing that was unusual here is, and you can see with the 15-basis-point investment in our gross margin, that that's a little smaller than where we ran in any of the quarters last year. And we've just identified that the reason it was as moderate as it was, was, in large part, because it was helped from the pharmacy. Now we knew that going in and had that expectation. So, it was part of a planned program, but that's about as far as I think we're going to be able to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more color around how we should think about your long-term debt market needs for the duration of this year. We appreciate the commentary around your shift to CP usage. Should we expect that to continue or is there a potential need for you to come back into the long-term debt markets this year?","J. Michael Schlotman","At some point in time this year, we will access the fixed income markets and term out some of the debt. We just made the strategic decision early on in the year because we have plenty of capacity on our revolver. Our exposure to floating rates over the last several years has actually been relatively modest. So to try to adjust for that, we've termed out in the short -- in the short run on work -- on our commercial -- well, it's the commercial paper that we issued backstopped by our bank revolver. The -- if you look at that trend since then, the balance of that has come in some, because this is really the point in time of the year where we generate a lot of cash flow. And that also gave us the comfort to have it out there on the commercial paper markets. When we think about issuing it at, let's say, between 40 and 45 basis points on a regular basis, as compared even to historically low rates...","[Technical Difficulty]","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sorry, can you hear us?","J. Michael Schlotman","We can now. Somehow, we lost the connection.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. I think you got cut off right after you talked about issuing on a regular basis at about 40 to 45 basis points.","J. Michael Schlotman","Okay. I appreciate you telling me how much of my wonderful answer I gave. See if I can repeat it now. So Cindy will look at the transcript to see how close the 2 of them compare. But we've been very successful with being able to issue that debt, as I said, in the 40- to 45-basis-point range. The fact of the matter is this part of the year is when we generate a lot of free cash flow. So we felt taking a little bit of risk of terming that -- putting that out on a working capital line made sense. We don't have, historically, a lot of floating rate exposure, and it was really an attempt to gain a little bit more exposure to floating rates. The amount of commercial paper we have outstanding has come in since then. But as you may or may not have heard me say, we do expect at some point this year to term out some of our longer-term debt needs.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Do you have any sense or could you give us any guidance on potential size or part of the curve that you might look at?","J. Michael Schlotman","I don't want to give too much insight to it. You can look at our 10-Q or 10-K, and you can see how many dollars we've had hedged to give you some insight to what we think we -- our expectations and needs may be. But as far as the exact amount and what duration those may be, we'll wait and see what the markets are like when we actually access the markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Citi.","Tiffany Kanaga","Can we get an update on how online retail and home delivery is going at King Soopers? And are there any thoughts around expanding it to other markets?","W. Rodney McMullen","As you know, we've been experimenting with Denver for several years. It continues to grow at a modest rate. We're working on it as much in terms of understanding the economics and trying to get a model that actually is profitable. So it's one of those things where you should see us continue to work on it to improve it. We've actually changed our team -- our complete digital team, in terms of bringing some high talent from the outside to help us accelerate our growth. We feel very good about where we are headed. And as you know, from a digital standpoint, it's broader than just what you sell online. We also are very aggressive on making sure we use our strength and insights we already have on our digital strategy, based on customer needs. We're having huge growth in terms of the use of our website, the use and download of our apps, and we're also partnering with dunnhumby to improve those from a relevancy standpoint. So we actually are looking at digital much broader than just what you sell online, and we're making huge progress in terms of connecting with the customer digitally, and partnering with dunnhumby to do that in a way that uses our strengths and insights.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question. Just with the recent launch of like AmazonFresh and there's more talk of delivery and e-commerce shopping for groceries, and I was just wondering if you could provide us with kind of your latest updates and thoughts on, I guess, e-commerce strategies or digital strategies within the grocery business.","W. Rodney McMullen","The -- I'll give a little bit -- just in terms of -- tied in and talked -- some of the comments I just made to Tiffany. As you know, we've had, where we deliver in Denver, for several years and -- a website where we sell through. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we continue to work on how to get that to scale and profitability. But we think it's important to look at it more than just what you sell on the web and how do you connect with a customer on an overall digital basis, and making sure we use some of the strengths and insights we have. We're having huge growth with people downloading our apps, using our apps on almost a daily type basis. And we partnered with dunnhumby in terms of making that relevant for each customer, using each customer in terms of setting the prioritization. We feel really good about where we're headed, and it's something we continue to work on and we continue to get better and better at. And selling is just one piece of that connection with the customer digitally.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got you. Got you. I mean, do you envision like a store pickup type of program? Or are you testing that anywhere?","W. Rodney McMullen","The -- we would be testing almost everything that you can imagine, but I think, at the end of the day, there will be something that will be a combination of a lot of different pieces together. And we actually think that, that's one of the strengths that will play to us, just because we have so many convenient stores located close to customers' houses that it'll be left up to customer in terms of how they want to engage with us.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. And then one last one and I apologize for repeating that question, but with -- the Affordable Care Act and how are you guys thinking about that? What kind of impact do you think it might have on you guys and your business, on the labor negotiations that you have? Just any thoughts and more color on that would be helpful.","David B. Dillon","Well, it certainly affects, in one way or another, everything you do that touches health care. So in all of our union negotiations, whether it's at the trust fund level or in the negotiations themselves, you have to make sure that the health care plans work their way to complying with and, actually, working together with what the Affordable Health Care Act requires. So we've been going through that process in negotiations, and it certainly adds some degree of tension in the negotiations. But we have a good, really solid working relationship with the locals that we work with, and as you've seen, the contracts get settled over the last, really couple of years. All of those have had some implications from the Affordable Health Care Act. As to the company plan, we have done the same thing within our own organization of making sure that we've worked through understanding those requirements and including them in our own plans. In terms of costs, sure, we think they will go up a little. We're not -- I don't think we've publicly quantified that and nor do we intend to today. But I think it's all been -- so far, been workable, and we've been happy with the way things have worked out so far. Rodney, you want to add anything?","W. Rodney McMullen","No, no.","Joseph I. Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Okay. So you -- I mean, I guess maybe deeper into the year, we'll get a better sense of what you're thinking as far as -- I mean, I guess, I'm trying to understand like will there be any kind of an EPS impact. Really, it's more a 2014 thing. And I know you don't want to quantify it today, but just should we expect that maybe at the October meeting or...","David B. Dillon","Well, what you should expect is that we took into account what we know about health care costs when we gave you the guidance in March and when we updated the guidance today for this year. And we also have in mind and have a sense of what we see in health care trends when we gave you the long-term guidance of our earnings growth of the 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend. So we're knowledgeable of that when we made those decisions. So to that extent, it's been included in what we've told you.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Jason DeRise.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just thought that -- again, sorry, for the background noise, but I thought the comment about the convenience stores, as they fit into this omni-channel Kroger, was really interesting. And I wanted to get a sense of how far into the future do you think that would be a reality, of the omni-channel Kroger using all the points in online and pickups. I know in the past, it's been said that Kroger is a slow Midwest-moving company, but some of these other retailers are thinking about this more aggressively. So if you can comment on that, that would be great.","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, it's really -- I mean, our strategy is really built around letting the customers decide digitally how they want to connect with us. And we spent a ton of effort and energy making sure that we do an awful lot of research and testing things enough to understand the economics of what we're doing. So it's really taking all the pieces and tying them together. And when -- you should expect to see us, when we find something that makes money, we'll move very aggressively. And until then, you'll see us continuing to test to make sure we're involved and aware, but we don't see a benefit of rolling something out that doesn't create value for our customers and our investors as well.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Hopefully, we hear more about this during the Investor Day.","David B. Dillon","And I think that's our last question. Given that we had disruption a couple of times on the call, I thought it would be best to run a little longer and make sure we got all the questions in, and we appreciate all of those. We apologize for the 2 interruptions that we had. And as I usually do, before we end the call today, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. We encourage them to do that.","First, I want to thank each of the 400 -- or 4,800 leaders around the country who joined us for the first-ever Kroger Leadership Summit in Louisville recently. Because of you, this event was a big success. Taking the next steps in our Customer 1st journey together is important, and we're inspired by the enthusiasm and the passion that you show for leading our associates and serving our customers. We know you will continue to make a difference everyday for our customers and our communities.","Also this month, we celebrate community service in a special way at Kroger. Through widespread volunteer activities, our associates help strengthen the communities where we live and work. We're pleased to recognize, in our Annual Report, 29 associates across the company for their outstanding service as recipients of Kroger's 2012 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent to feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and coach at-risk teens, among many other causes, and we are grateful for their commitment.","I want to personally thank all our associates from coast to coast, who volunteer in so many ways. Rodney and I are touched by the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others in all the places around America that we call home. That completes our call today. We thank you all for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Cindy and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","2014 was an outstanding year for Kroger. First, let me say how proud I am to work with such a great and outstanding team of associates. Each of them deserves a round of applause for improving our connection with all customers and growing our core business, right in line with our growth strategy. Second, I am pleased to report that we kept our commitments to you, our shareholders. As you know, the growth plan we first outlined in October of 2012 includes four key performance indicators: positive identical supermarket sales growth, slightly expanding non-fuel FIFO operating margin, growing return on invested capital and annual market share growth.","In 2014, we met or exceeded each of these metrics. At the end of the year, we achieved an industry-leading 45th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, without fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling four-quarter basis. We improved return on invested capital even as we increased capital investment. And we captured incremental market share for the 10th consecutive year.","Strong performance means strong shareholder returns. We exceeded our long-term, net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% in fiscal 2014, and we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year, since we reinstated our dividend. Because we've been delivering this level, high level of performance, consistently and for so long, it can start to look easy or be taken for granted. It is important to know that our associates are committed to our continued success today and for the future.","We made progress on the other key elements of our growth strategy as well. We are innovating to grow. We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives the customer, our customers, the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our Corporate Brand team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organics brand, Simple Truth, hit a $1 billion in annual sales for the first time in less than two years after the introduction.","We are investing to grow in both new and existing markets. We continue to pursue our fill-in strategy and are making good progress. Our mergers with Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com have opened new markets that present meaningful growth opportunities for Kroger. We continue to create jobs. Today, we proudly employ nearly 25,000 more associates than we did last year at this time. Every day we are creating opportunities for both new and current employees.","Our strong, across-the-board results during fiscal 2014 allowed us to make a strategic and significant contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation this year. We use our foundation dollars to support causes that our customers consistently tell us they care about, that enhances our reputation as a locally-connected retailer. We are very proud that Forbes magazine previously recognized our work by naming us the most generous company in America. This contribution will allow Kroger to continue to support our key priorities, including hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families, and local community organizations. We are proud to make this investment to continue our efforts to support our customers and the communities that support our growth.","Kroger customers are increasingly positive about the economy since late last year through the new year. They are feeling more comfortable with their discretionary spending, in part due to the low retail price of fuel. Even so, how our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their family's finances. Customers' perceptions of the economic recovery are still very much divided. And yet, we continue to deepen loyalty with all of our customers. That is because whatever the external factors are at play at a given time, be it inflation in certain commodities, fluctuating fuel prices, or unemployment, we adjust to win with the customer.","So while inflation affected fuel costs through 2014, our personalized offers, weekly promotions and price investments helped customers stretch their dollars. We are currently investing $3.5 billion annually in lower prices. Even though natural and organic foods have been notoriously out of reach for many customers, we used our merchandising expertise, manufacturing base and buying power to make them affordable and accessible to all customers through Simple Truth, which continues to see double-digit sales growth. And while customers will always have evolving expectations for convenience, we have improved our prepared food offering to meet their changing needs as well.","Like a great meal, there is no single characteristic that makes Kroger great; rather, it is the sum of its parts. It is the combination of food and drink, people and atmosphere, surprise and delight that makes a great meal, great. And it is that combination of factors that our associates bring together, the sum of our parts that explains why Kroger is so successful.","Before I turn it over to Mike Ellis, I wanted to let you know that both the Harris Teeter and Vitacost mergers are going very well thanks to the incredible people at both companies. Mike will have more to say about these and our operational performance. Mike?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Rodney. Good morning everyone. This was a great quarter, capping off a really great year. Our associates make everything happen, and they knocked it out of the park this year on several fronts.","We achieved an outstanding fourth quarter ID sales growth without fuel of 6%. As Rodney pointed out in our press release this morning, while improved fuel margins contributed significantly to our reported results in the second half of the year, our operating performance without fuel shows that our associates are continuing to deepen our relationship with customers in very meaningful ways. The better our connection with customers, the better our shareholder returns. Our identical sales performance was supported by robust performance in every department and every supermarket division. Natural foods, meat, deli and pharmacy departments all posted double-digit identical sales growth.","For the tenth year in a row, we lowered costs and reinvested those savings to improve our store experience. It's no surprise that Kroger captured more share of the massive food market also for the tenth year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report on market share annually, and look at it as the customers would look at it where they spend their money.","Last year, we began using Nielsen POS+, a Kroger term for Nielsen data that includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy. The data is generated by retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes all major food, drug, mass and dollar competitors as well as most club competitors. It does not include C-stores. Nielsen POS+ captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including UPC-coded items, PLU and random weight items, making it a really good and consistent source.","According to Nielsen POS+ data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2014. This data also indicates that our share increased in 18 markets of the 20 markets outlined by the Nielsen report, and was down slightly in just two markets. Walmart is one of our top competitors in 15 markets of the 20 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger share increased in all of those markets.","In addition to market share growth, we regularly measure our loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. Customers are buying fewer units per basket but visiting our stores more frequently. This is consistent with the trend for the past several quarters. Inflation continued in pharmacy and among commodities such as meat during the fourth quarter. We estimate product inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect the strong tonnage growth that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue.","We've talked a lot this year about our Corporate Brands growth and success. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with Corporate Brands representing 28.2% of total units sold, the highest level in at least seven years and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. The star, of course, has been Simple Truth. And in 2014, Simple Truth reached an amazing milestone by hitting a $1.2 billion annual sales mark. Simple Truth has been our most successful brand launch ever, reaching billion dollar brand status in less than two short years. During the year, more than 20 million households bought one or more of our 2,688 Simple Truth or Simple Truth Organic items. The brand continues to earn double-digit unit and sales growth, which we don't see ending anytime soon.","Shifting gears, we just completed our first year since merging with Harris Teeter, and our integration efforts have been fantastic. We are creating synergies both ways, and we are learning new ways to connect with our customers. The Harris Teeter team is great, and both they and our General Office teams have done an outstanding job in working together. Also we are six months into the Vitacost merger and our integration is going well. We continue to discover new ways to use Vitacost as a strategic advantage. We already have a strong Natural Foods business, and Vitacost is helping us get better in that category. A cornerstone of our ability to deliver successful mergers is partnering with businesses that share our cultures and values. This makes it easy to share ideas between each other. Harris Teeter and Vitacost both illustrate that point.","Finally, I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We are currently negotiating in Louisville and with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. During 2015, we will also negotiate agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus, Denver, Las Vegas, Memphis and Portland, Oregon. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates.","Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities, and enhance job security, for our associates. We have very positive momentum with our customers, associates and communities as we move into 2015.","Now, Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results, as well as our guidance for 2015. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. Before I share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, there are a few things to keep in mind about fiscal 2014. There are two items that we are adjusting our full year results for: charges incurred in the first quarter related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits; and certain tax benefits that we enjoyed in the third quarter.","A lot of other things happened throughout the year as well, including: low retail fuel prices and unusually-high fuel margins; a LIFO charge that was significantly higher in 2014 than in 2013; a $55 million contribution to our UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter; and, as Rodney mentioned, we contributed $85 million to the company's charitable foundation throughout the year, $60 million of which was in the fourth quarter.","Now, I'll share our fourth quarter results. Please note that Kroger's operating results include Harris Teeter in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2014, but not in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013, which affects many year-over-year comparisons. Total sales in the fourth quarter were $25.2 billion, an increase of 8.5%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 14.2%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $518 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. We recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the quarter, compared to a $10 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin was comparable to the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation, and the adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the same period last year.","Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full-year 2014 results, I'll share some data on our fuel operations, which includes our supermarket fuel and C-store business. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.234 compared to $0.113 in the same quarter last year. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.19 compared to $0.141 last year. Going forward, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages.","Turning now to Kroger's full-year results for 2014. Kroger reported total sales of $108.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 10.3%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 12.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales, without fuel, increased 5.2% in 2014 compared to the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.73 billion, or $3.44 per diluted share. Excluding the 2014 adjustment items, net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.77 billion, or $3.52 per diluted share. It is important to note that if you look at adjusted EPS excluding fuel, it was at the high end of our long-term growth rate even with the contributions to the pension and foundation included. So while fuel margins get a lot of attention, our non-fuel business had a spectacular year.","Kroger's LIFO charge for 2014 was $147 million, significantly higher than 2013 due to higher product costs. FIFO gross margin for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 3 basis points. As Mike said, strong identical supermarket sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to reduce operating expenses as a rate of sales for our tenth consecutive year. Total operating expenses for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation, and the adjustment items, decreased 13 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. FIFO operating margin for 2014, excluding those same items, increased 10 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for fiscal 2014 of 13.74%, compared to 13.43% for fiscal 2013.","For 2015, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, fund the dividend, and increase capital investments. In connection with our merger with Harris Teeter, we committed to getting back to a 2 times to 2.2 times net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid-to-late fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our objective earlier than anticipated due to strong fiscal 2014 operating results. As of the close of the fourth quarter, net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.15 times, compared to 2.43 times during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of the press release. Based on our current 2015 expectations, we should maintain a ratio below the 2.2 times target throughout the year.","Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $2.8 billion for the year, compared to $2.3 billion in 2013. For 2015, we expect capital investments to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range. As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. New store openings are meeting our expectations. We have a great pipeline of high quality projects that we expect to allow this result to continue. We will allocate more of this spend to increase square footage in our fill-in markets. We have now identified eight markets for fill-in opportunities, this is up from six. Our excitement for this activity continues to grow.","Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the year, Kroger repurchased 28.4 million common shares for a total investment of $1.3 billion. As of February 27, 2015, Kroger has approximately $432 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase authority granted in June 2014.","Now, I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2015. We anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2015. This range takes into account several factors. It is early in the year, our outlook for inflation is lower than actual inflation last year, and we expect our strong trend in unit growth to continue in 2015. Full-year net earnings for fiscal 2015 are expected to range from $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. This equates to Kroger's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, growing off of 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time.","As we think about the growth in 2015, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages, we are not planning for similar contributions to the pension or foundation, and we expect LIFO to be lower than it was in 2014. We are anticipating inflation without fuel of 1% to 2% and the actual amount will be driven primarily by inflation in meat and pharmacy. So while fuel margins will be a headwind in 2015, we expect they will be offset by a lower LIFO charge, no planned contributions to the pension plan and our foundation, and the continued strength in our core business.","For the full year, our expectation is that we will be in the middle portion of the range. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe quarter one will be in the range, quarters two and three will be slightly above the range, and quarter four will be below the range. And as we expect Kroger's full-year operating profit margin in 2015, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2014 results.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mike. I'm so proud of our team. We fulfilled our commitments to our customers, associates, shareholders and bondholders in 2014. Kroger captured more share of the massive food market and continued to invest in growing our business. We created thousands of new jobs, and hired more than 6,000 veterans last year. While we are very proud of this outstanding year, we are committed to even more. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, our to-do list remains longer than our done list.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question today will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, guys, a few things. I think you said $3.5 billion of annual investment in price, was that right? And what do you include in there? Is that merely price reductions, promotions, or something else? Is that sustainable? Do you think you can do $3.5 billion a year? And then what happens to the elasticity of the return over time? Do the returns remain high on that investment?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, the $3.5 billion, John, that you heard us talk about, yes, that's an annual number. And that's the annual number in 2014. Now if you look at \u2013 obviously we started the journey about 10 years ago of taking costs out of the business and taking that \u2013 as we take costs out of the business, giving the customer better value both in everyday price and promotional. We would \u2013 we see it as our strategy to continue that as we take costs out of the business. We'll continue to give that to the customer in a combination of service and price based on what we see the opportunities to be. We are very satisfied with the elasticity of the demand side as we invest in price. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of data that we have developed internally to make sure that we're investing that in the right place where we get the best return. So, we would see it sustainable, and it is part of our continued strategy. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No. I think that's it, Rodney.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. So as far as you can tell, there's enough things to invest in that the return will remain \u2013 you think it'll remain what it's been as far as the eye can see, it sounds like.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Absolutely. And every category would have different results, and that's one of the values of our insight is, understanding that.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right and then just one for Mike Schlotman. I know you guys have liked a front-end loaded buyback program, right, for the productivity that gives you throughout the year. Is that the idea this year? Is that sort of embedded in the guidance that a lot of it'll be done in the first half?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would say the day-to-day market conditions will wind up dictating when we make those investments, but I would point out the fact that at the end of \u2013 when we had our conference call in December, we had not used any of the $500 million buyback authorization. And from my comments today, we have used some now.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice quarter.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. Good morning.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. So I just want start maybe with the center store trends. We've heard from a number of large CPG players just about challenges, and there's some in the center store categories. So, I wanted to get a sense whether you guys are seeing the same thing or any more color, what's happening there?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, actually, our center store has performed better in the fourth quarter than it had in other quarters in 2014, and we've done a lot of work in relaying our center store, getting things refreshed, new products in, and it's been a big focus of us to using customer insights and really going through our stores and doing the work that's around assortment that's really effective.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","The other thing that's \u2013 a lot of the CPGs would have something different than what we would have is on a lot of the natural food items, do you include that in center store or a separate department? And it's getting increasingly complicated, because there are certain categories where natural foods, is almost as big as the historical business. So, it's a short question, but hard to answer. For us, we're completely focused on what is it that the customer wants.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. And then switching gears, maybe to the Simple Truth brand, you achieved your target this year for sales of more than $1 billion, do you have any new targets out there and is it getting more difficult to get the supply for that business?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Supply has been an issue in certain areas, but when you have over 2,600 items, we have a great base of product today, and we're going to continue to expand that. But for the most part, in some of the perishable areas, there's been a supply issue or two, but we've been able to really take care of the customer and I don't foresee anything this year and in the near future.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","But certain categories will always have some tightness on supply, especially at the front end as farmers transition over to growing more of the organic or natural product.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I have made \u2013 this is a question for Mike.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Which one?","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Oh, sorry. That's right, Mike Schlotman. Question about labor negotiations. The very strong performance of the company, do you think that makes it harder for you to get the unions to go along with what you want? Or are they, maybe the better, bigger question is, are they pushing for wage increases?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If you look at our average wage of our hourly associates in the store, it's nearly $14 an hour, and if you look at the total benefit package our associates enjoy, it's even stronger than that. It varies obviously by geography and particular contract. We've been on the forefront, not only with a good solid wage. We've had \u2013 we've been very upfront with the unions and have done a lot of things to protect the future pension benefits of our associates, which others aren't doing out there. It's not just the big one we did two years or three years ago, we did some more smaller ones in the first quarter this year, and it wouldn't surprise me if there will be others that we wind up doing in the future.","If you look overall, we are adding jobs. We added 25,000 jobs last year. We're up to 400,000 jobs. One of the things that we like to say around Kroger is a lot of people, particularly part-time workers that are under 18, they come to Kroger looking for a job, and they stay for a career. If you look around the ranks of our store managers, two thirds of them started out as hourly, part-time hourly associates in our store. And that really just talks to the fabric of Kroger and how well we treat our associates overall. So, it's more than just about the wages. There's a lot more behind-the-scenes of what those associates look for when they come to Kroger.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Plus, what you make today is something different than you will make as you get promoted throughout your career and take on more responsibility.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, changing gears, maybe just talk a little bit about the tests you have of \"click and collect\" in Cincinnati? Maybe it's too early to say anything, but are you feeling good about how that's going?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, it is too early to say anything, Meredith, but the learnings that we have from Harris Teeter is really helping us develop our plans on how we're going to go forward. And Harris Teeter has had a very successful business for \u2013 well, they started over 10 years ago in the \"click and collect\" world. And we've learned a lot, and it's really helping us accelerate our learning and growth.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Meredith.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Great quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Karen.","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Karen.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just a little color, I guess, following on John Heinbockel's question, in terms of share buybacks, obviously, your guidance for fiscal 2015 is very strong given the tailwind that you're going to have in gas margins. So I mean, maybe a little color on how much of this is buyback related versus core EBIT growth. I don't know if you can just elaborate a little bit on that?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I won't get that granular on the model. From an expectation standpoint, you should have the expectation, we'll probably spend a little bit less on share buyback during \u2013 in terms of dollars in 2015 versus 2014. We are increasing our expectations for capital spend by a few hundred million dollars more because of the great pipeline of projects I spoke of in the prepared comments. And that's what we think we would believe is the driver for growth in the future. Keep in mind back in October of 2012, we said for the first couple of years of this new growth model, we would have 25% \u2013 a quarter to a one-third of our EPS growth may come from share buybacks, but that would decline over time as we continue to open successful stores in our fill-in markets.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking at the year in general, so when I look at obviously how strong this year was can you maybe try to frame how much of it was Harris Teeter related in terms of Harris Teeter outperforming what your original guidance was on accretion? I mean, obviously let's exclude fuel from the conversation. And then just following on that is when we start to model comps throughout the year, any color on how we should think of how Harris Teeter now that it's in the comp base, how that'll impact the comp throughout the year?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I won't give specifics on Harris Teeter. I would say that they added a little bit more to earnings per share than our original expectations for the year. They had a phenomenal year, they also helped the core at Kroger with some ideas that they have done historically and helped the core Kroger have a very strong year as well. Relative to the comp cadence throughout the year, even though we only had Harris Teeter as a business for this year, we included them in our comp base all year using their 2013 sales, so the sales numbers we reported during 2014 actually included Harris Teeter as though we had owned them in 2013. So, there won't be a big inflection point in ID sales from, including Harris Teeter going forward.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Even though the comps might have been pressured from investing in price?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","They \u2013 again, their ID sales were included in our 2014 results.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So going forward, they'll continue to be in there.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. So \u2013 sorry, yeah?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I was just going to add to Mike's thing. If you look at, Harris Teeter delivered more than we were expecting, and that was driven because of their strong operations and synergies, but fuel obviously drove it, but if you look at the core Kroger even without those two items, we still exceeded as well. So it was really all three pieces that drove the strong results.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Again, congratulations as well on a nice quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","First question just for Mike Schlotman. On the cadence of the EPS growth next year, Mike, you mentioned Q1 being in line with the range for the year. I guess I would've thought that maybe it would have been better, because the fuel comparison is obviously easier there. You still get the benefit from the repo in the first quarter and the share count, and then I would imagine that your comps are probably stronger earlier in the year than later. Could you just maybe help us understand why Q1 would just be in line?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","At this point, that's \u2013 we had a very, very strong first quarter last year. So, we are comping off of that. I agree that there will still be some residual benefit in the first quarter from the share buyback, but that was very front-end loaded last year. And we'll \u2013 and as I said earlier, we'll buy less shares back this year than last year. So, the combination of those, the way we bought it back last year did help the first quarter a bit. It's, a lot of it lines up depending on a huge number of factors, and we just recently finalized our business plan by quarter based off of how the year wound up and what our expectations are for the various quarters, and the best answer I can give you is, we're trying to be transparent about how our operators and so forth feel about the cadence throughout the year.","And that's what our expectations are. There's a lot of factors that go into it. LIFO certainly will play a factor of how and when we get expense charges in the quarter. As you know, we increased our LIFO charge throughout the year and then it came down in the fourth quarter, so if our estimate for LIFO is accurate this year, the second quarter and third quarter will be helped a little bit by a lower LIFO charge as compared to the prior year. So there's lots of things that wind up going into building that model.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow up, and this is just on your IDs generally. Your IDs typically have outpaced the industry for a very long time, but it does seem like more recently that this gap has widened. And I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, is there anything that you can identify that you think has driven that acceleration? For instance, you saw a windfall in fuel in the back half. Have you been able to use some of those proceeds to help you around the pricing front or the other things that have maybe helped this acceleration in the outperformance to the industry?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ed, it's a question that actually we've spent a little bit of time trying to think through internally, and probably the biggest thing is our associates, our store teams and all the people that support our stores, they continue to do a better job of helping serve our customers on a daily basis. Everything from making sure products are fresher to making sure that we treat our customers right. And we really do believe we had a great foundation in place and our associates really are taking it up to the next level in terms of how they're taking care of our customers. And we think that that's what's the thing that's really been successful and we really appreciate what our associates are doing.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on very nice end to the year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask about natural organic, which as you mentioned, of course continues to see some nice growth, Simple Truth being the main contributor to that. But outside of Simple Truth, can you sort of give any other color in terms of maybe some other category or brand growth within and in particular maybe any early color around Vitacost? Any cross selling or expansion there?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great question. Within Natural Foods, there's so many categories that customers are connecting with today that gets stronger and stronger, from dairy products, gluten-free, we could go on and on. And our ability to cross-merchandise some of those products throughout the store, I think has made some of those products more available in a broader way to a larger customer base. We keep talking about the blurring of departments and Natural Foods is becoming more and more mainstream for many people. So it's really broad-based when you look at where the growth is, and we're trying all kinds of new things to make these types of products more available to our customers every day. On Vitacost, we love what we have and it's a solid platform and we plan to do other things with that over time. And I think you'll be seeing some things in the near future.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, all right. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, maybe switching over quickly to Harris Teeter. Are all Harris Teeter stores now having the \"click and collect\" capability? And also, I know that you started in your Harris Teeter (42:44) in one region. Any further plans for roll out that you could talk to for this year, this coming year?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Well, we're still at beta testing in one store here in Cincinnati. But at Harris Teeter, we're at about a 160-some stores that are currently offering that to the customer. And I'll tell you what, the growth is exciting. Customers love the service, and the numbers continue to grow. We're setting new records at Harris Teeter all the time on more customers shopping this \u2013 in this way, and it's a big part of our strategy going forward.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, all right. Fair enough. Thanks very much. Best of luck.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and gosh, someone ate their wheaties this fourth quarter...","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I hear a headline coming.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","I just used it, maybe. But so my question is actually more strategic. As we kind of take a step back, you said a couple of things, $3.5 billion of investment in price kind of ongoing. I think, Mike Schlotman, you said you pushed up that CapEx growth rate a little bit again. So my question really goes to the top line growth of this organization. I mean is it time we accelerated it further? It seems like it's gone on a little bit but I mean is it time we continued to push? I was talking to one investor who said, Kroger is kind of the Costco with the grocery industry at this stage where they continuously reinvest. So what's your thought? I mean, is the growth rate, what should we think of as ongoing topline growth rate? Can it go higher? How do we get it higher? Is this something that the company is thinking about?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, Scott, it's a great question, and it's certain something we think about. And the investor you're talking to please pass along our appreciation for the complement, because we have a great deal of respect for Costco. We think about it a lot. In terms of, I guess, I would really say use your model to figure out how to accelerate the growth. As you know, we continue to accelerate the number of new stores, and we continue to try to make sure that our identical store sales stay strong. So I think that would automatically cause a continuation of an increasing growth rate. But we've spent a tremendous amount of energy and efforts on trying to accelerate our growth at a pace that makes sense for our organization. And one of the keys is we have to make sure we have developed associates to be able to handle the accelerated growth as well.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","And since they are and we've talked about this before, Rodney, I appreciate that answer, there has kind of become a Kroger way, a Kroger model, driven by, I think you're just advantaged in big data. How do you get that model into more consumers' hands in markets maybe that you're not in? I mean, you really haven't expanded, I guess Harris Teeter did it for you, but, I mean, do you agree that there's a superior model now and it would be advantageous for the company to bring it to more markets?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I was going to answer the question until you said the last part.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We'll still let him answer, though.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We wouldn't ever think that we have a superior way, and all we're really focused on is how to get a little bit better tomorrow than we were yesterday. And, for us, that would probably be the biggest part of the Kroger way is really trying to understand what the customers' wants and needs are and trying to get a little bit better at delivering against those. And over time, numerous times, we've said anything that's available out there you should assume that we've looked at it, and it's really making sure that we find something that adds value for our shareholders and something that we think the teams fit in well with Kroger, and we can do something for the customer that they don't already have. And, when you look at Harris Teeter, it checked all those boxes, and the Harris Teeter team was just amazing. But on smaller scale, Vitacost has been the same way and on a real small scale, YOU Tech has been the same thing. So it's really, we're constantly trying to look at things that add new growth for us.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","And next we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you \u2013 sort of a broad follow-up question from what everybody else has been asking. 2014, you guys have characterized as somewhat unusually good year. Can you sort of walk us through some of the things that could continue? Sort of the puts and takes on 2015 and why or why not it could or could not be another unusually kind of good year, and sort of the areas what I was hoping you would cover is things like the comp contribution from natural foods. Is that slowing in 2015 versus 2014? The competitive environment seemed to maybe be a little less competitive in 2014 for a lot of food retailers. What does that feel like right now as you look out? And then maybe a little more color on the puts and takes in inflation. Is there anything that could keep inflation from decelerating sequentially as you move through the year? And then the fourth part would be customer trade up. Was that a significant support to your accelerating comps in 2014? And could that continue in 2015 as a driver? Thanks.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, one very long question. If I ask you to repeat parts of those, I was trying to scribble them down and as everybody here at Kroger knows when I write slowly, it's hard to read my penmanship. Rodney took better notes apparently. The first point on what \u2013 the broad question, we obviously get very thoughtful and step back pretty far when we think about where we should set our expectations for a particular year. We've become very careful and protective of the overall business model that we've developed, and that focus on the customer is front and center. And as we decide what EBITDA growth rate and earnings-per-share growth rate is appropriate to ask our divisions and our different operating units to generate during a particular fiscal year, that's first and foremost. We really don't start necessarily with, here's what the answer has to be. It's what can the answer be and how do we actually build a model that winds up generating that.","From a comp standpoint, there's numbers of factors that can go into where the IDs can wind up being. One of those that you mentioned was inflation. We are expecting a little bit less inflation. That said, as you know, we have a very large and robust pharmacy business. That was a huge driver of the LIFO charge this year. Where that winds up in 2015 is purely a guess at this point. As I've said oftentimes, if we've done nothing else, the ability to predict a LIFO charge is something that is difficult at best. You mentioned competition. I don't think competition is benign by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's relatively consistent. It's always highly competitive. You never know what a competitor is going to do.","We certainly assume that the current competitive condition is not going to get better than it is today. And it's always been a highly competitive industry, there's always new people trying to take part of your business that have different operating models, whether it's a Sprouts or those kinds of operators or Publix coming into Charlotte, like they have, trying to take part of Harris Teeter's business. And we build a model to defend our turf no matter where those folks try to come. When you looked at customer trade up, I would say it's somewhat \u2013 there's a lot of things out there that are affecting broad customer base.","Certainly, I think we probably would've seen some trade up from the customer who has been less affected by the downturn in the economy over the last several years, probably spending a little bit more money in a variety of outlets, certainly some of ours. I would say that customer who has been on a budget for the last several years, they probably aren't spending a whole lot more money on being big contributors to a consumer-driven economy. They're probably able to take care of some of the bills that they manage on a monthly basis, trying to remember which one they're going to push off for a little while and they've probably been able to be a little bit more current on your bills but not a whole lot more disposable income. So it's a pretty big mixed bag out there. Certainly where fuel costs are going to wind up and a whole lot of other factors enter into it. I know I've been going on for a bit here, but it's a long and difficult \u2013 one, the question was long, but there's not a precise answer to say it's A and B and that's what drives the final answer. We take in a lot of factors as we plan a year and think about how it's going to wind up being.","Robert F. Ohmes - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","That's very helpful, Mike. Just the one area, just the one last area that I want to ask about, so on natural foods, you guys had big increases in square footage allocation to that space, very noticeable the last couple of years. I think that's slowed a lot. Should we expect less tailwind from natural foods to your comps in 2015 versus what you've seen in the last couple years?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think you're going to continue to see great growth in natural foods. It's more of a way of life for our customer today. Okay. The other thing is that in certain categories we are starting to integrate it rather than put it in a separate space as well.","Robert F. Ohmes - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Robert.","Operator","And next we have a question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. A couple, can you help us a bit with how QTV comp trends are proceeding, either quantitatively or qualitatively? And I guess similarly on 1Q fuel margins to date, any sort of flow-through margin help or have retail prices come down enough to maybe offset wholesale ones at this point?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If you look at our identical sales so far this quarter, and obviously, it's very early in the year because we're just a few weeks into the year. It would be slightly ahead of the guidance we gave. But it's very early in the year. On fuel margins, Mike, I'll have to let you answer that one because I don't know the answer to that one.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I don't think we need to talk about weekly fuel margins. It's difficult enough to predict what a year's going to be, let alone four or five weeks, because it's such a volatile area. Just won't go down that path this morning.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, that's fair. And then my follow-up is you're guiding to inflation being about 1.5% lower than it was in 2014. Are you talking about maybe a roughly 1.5% deceleration in total ID sales ex-fuel? So always risky embarrassing myself by asking a simple math question, but is it fair to assume your guidance is thus implying that everything outside passing along inflation, right, sort of traffic and basket size, you are expecting that to grow at a similar rate in 2015 as 2014, roughly?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, as Mike Ellis said in his prepared remarks, we had great tonnage growth throughout the year and it accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we don't see any reason why that would slow down during the year, and it winds up being in our hands to continue that underlying unit growth.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Just first wanted to double-check on guidance. So I think the message for next year is you had the very strong benefit from the fuel margins in the back half, but you have lower LIFO, none of the pension, you don't cycle that pension expense again next year in the foundation expense, and so net-net you still can kind of maintain that 8% to 11% earnings growth, but it sounds like fuel still may be somewhat of a headwind. So I don't know if you can maybe parse out the net impact of those factors that were kind of swing factors this year, just to help us kind of think about how the guidance for 2015?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, if you look at where fuel margins benefited us, and we talked about what the fuel margins were for the year, you know roughly what our gallons are over time, so you can probably figure out the incremental benefit from a margin standpoint on fuel. So, if you think about that normalizing and then LIFO expectation being lower, not having the pension contribution or contribution to the charitable foundations, they don't perfectly offset one another, but they come close to being negating one another, and that's why we're growing off of the $3.52 at the 8% to 11%. Keep in mind, all of that information aside, our core operations without those would've been at the high end of our 8% to 11% range all by themselves last year, and it's really that underlying strength in the core business that gives us the comfort to be able to have another great year in the 8% to 11% range.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Perfect. That's very helpful. And then just on the comps for the quarter, I think when you were planning the comps for the quarter in Q3, you'd talked about cycling the benefit from the weather. Just curious what really came in better than expected for the fourth quarter in terms of those core ID comps? Was there a weather benefit? Or did you just kind of hang on to some of those customers that maybe were pushed into your stores last year with the weather or, just curious, thoughts there.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The weather would not have been as helpful this year as it was prior year. So it was really hanging on to some of those customers, and really the operating merchandising team is doing a great job of making sure that we had strong programs to cycle that weather. So it was really the team executing, doing a great job.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay, Kelly.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll take one more question.","Operator","Okay. And that final question will come from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thank you. Wanted to get some thoughts, now that you're contemplating more of these fill-in markets, what should we be thinking about for a longer-term square footage growth rate for you? Because you have been fading off of your store closures, so I'm curious what the flow-through is going to be on actual net square footage growth?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it's really difficult to predict exactly how many operational closings you're going to have in a particular year, and there's a wide variety of reasons those happen. But if you look at our gross, we expect it to be 2% to 2.5% next year. Our net was a little bit under 1% last year. Our store count has been down. Keep in mind sometimes when we close an under-performing store, we may be closing an under-performing store. It's under-performing because its sales per square foot are at the way low end of a range of what will make that store profitable.","And as we replace that store or open a new store, that's larger than that, the net square footage may not go up dramatically, but the sales per square foot of that new store can often be several multiples of the store we closed. So it's a little misleading just to say oh square footage growth hasn't been that much, so they can't grow sales that much. The difference between that productivity of the new store and the store we closed can be quite remarkable sometimes.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And were there any tax implications from the charitable contribution in the fourth quarter or anything that carries into 2015?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Obviously we got a tax deduction for that, but it didn't affect the tax rate in any way, shape, or form. We've just taken advantage of the opportunity of a very strong year to be able to continue to have dollars to support the efforts that we support, both that are important to us and are important to our customers.","Mark G. Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Well, congratulations on a very strong core grocery performance for the quarter and the year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mark.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I want to thank everybody for calling in today and listening to our call.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note today\u2019s event is being recorded.","At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.","Kate Ward","Thanks, Jamie. Good morning and thank you for joining us.

After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger\u2019s first quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","As we all know, there is a lot of change in the food retail industry \u2013 both in terms of the operating environment and competitive landscape. The best thing that we can do is to stay on the offense by continuing to focus on our customers \u2013 what they want and need today and what we anticipate they will want and need tomorrow \u2013 and executing our strategy.","We continue to manage our business for the long-term and to deliver earnings growth on a three-year to five-year time horizon. We are making meaningful investments in our digital and online growth. We believe that customers of the future will want to shop with us for anything, anytime, and anywhere.","In the first quarter, we saw more than 30% growth in new digital customers and a more than 30% increase in digital visits \u2013 with faster growth in mobile compared to last year. We are also building on our personalization expertise to benefit our customers. An example of this is My Magazine, which delivers personalized content like recipes to loyal households based on their shopping behavior and interests.","In fact, we delivered more than 6 million unique My Magazine offers in the first quarter alone. This also allows us to offer personalized lower prices to our loyal households in addition to the low prices everyone can see. This is another example of how we leverage 84.51\u2019s expertise. We are investing in our people. We are improving customer service by both increasing labor hours in certain areas and increasing starting wages in certain markets. Taken together, these steps will improve the customer experience and improve retention.","I share these examples to demonstrate that we are laser-focused on providing our customers with the right value proposition. This is our Customer 1st Promise - our commitment to provide friendly service, fresh foods, and low prices, every day. And this is what we will continue to do, regardless of the external factors, because it\u2019s what our customers deserve and what we know ultimately that delivers shareholder value.","These investments both maintain and enhance our position in our markets. And while it is still early in 2017, we are starting to see some traction. We are happy with the better identical sales trend in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, and we are pleased to see that our current identical sales trend is positive. The last nine weeks of the first quarter were positive, and so is our second quarter to date.","Our teams continue to innovate in new and exciting ways that reflect where our customers are going. Recognizing the demand for convenience, high quality, and best value, Kroger\u2019s Culinary Development Team launched an incredible collection of Prep+Pared meal kits that we are currently piloting in Cincinnati stores. We can hardly keep them on the shelves! And it's easy to see why as soon as you try them.","Kroger\u2019s Prep+Pared meal kits offer restaurant-quality meals that are easy to cook in about 20 minutes. We think customers will love knowing they are available in stores when they are wondering along about 2 o'clock in the afternoon what\u2019s for dinner. Our Brands are one of the primary means we have to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.","Last year, we commissioned an independent third-party to conduct research that would give us an objective view of how our customers view Our Brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private label foods. Our research showed that the most-loved brands sold in our stores are Our Brands above even the national brands! And in the blind taste tests, Our Brands outperformed competitive national brand and other private label products almost 100% of the time.","Our products in Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands rated significantly above their respective competitive offerings. Of course, our journey is never done so our customers will continue to see rising quality and better value on Our Brand products in the future. By having brands our customers love that are only available from us, we gain loyalty and advocacy from our customers.","Our Brands represented approximately 28% of total units sold, and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy, during the first quarter. Our customers\u2019 needs are constantly changing. What doesn\u2019t change is their desire for a welcoming customer experience with an abundant variety of food, available when and how they want it, all at a great value. That\u2019s why we regularly evolve the execution of our Customer 1st Strategy, while the core strategy itself doesn\u2019t change.","Too often, American consumers have to make a choice between low prices and a great experience, compromising one for the other. Kroger is uniquely situated to eliminate the need for that compromise; serving customers who are hungry for more than food, who want to be nourished in ways that help them live their lives best.","Kroger\u2019s purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit and we are more confident than ever that by living our purpose and delivering our Customer 1st Promise, we\u2019ll deliver long-term shareholder value that you can count on. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.","And here is Mike to go into more detail on our first quarter results. Mike?","Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Like Rodney said, we were glad to see the better results compared to the fourth quarter for identical food store sales and for the second quarter-to-date, our ID sales are positive. Tonnage continued to be positive during the first quarter. We continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products as well as areas where we are saving customers\u2019 time, such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-heat meal solutions.","Visits per household were flat in the first quarter. Basket size and price per unit were down, but those were offset by household growth. Loyal households grew 3.2% compared to last years first quarter and our loyal households had positive ID sales growth in the first quarter.","In the first quarter, our gross margin was down, operating costs were up, and FIFO operating profit was down. While this is not representative of our typical expectations, it is important to keep in mind that we are making very deliberate and targeted investments in line with our Customer 1st Strategy.","As Rodney outlined earlier we\u2019ve made conscious decisions to increase starting wages in certain markets to improve associate engagement and retention that will create a better experience for our customers. We continued to invest and grow our digital business. Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year. This includes revenue from ClickList, Harris Teeter\u2019s ExpressLane and Vitacost.com.","As we continued to invest in price, we also remind you, Kroger\u2019s investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at our gross margins in the early 2000s compare to today. Kroger has invested more than $3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers over that time period. We have no intention of giving up the momentum we\u2019ve gained on low prices. These investments enable us to connect with our customers in a deeper way and increase our market share over time.","We are pleased that Kroger\u2019s market share, as traditionally calculated, was up in the first quarter. That said, we recognize there is no perfect metric for capturing market share. We are doing a lot of work to better define or perhaps redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores.","We see food as a massive, $1.5 trillion market, and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market. I also want to stress that we are committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales. Many of the things we are doing to pull costs out of the business today set us up for savings in the future. We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts.","Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.171 compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.33 times compare to 2.12 during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares.","Over the last four quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.5 billion in common shares, pay $438 million in dividends, invest $3.4 billion in capital, and merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment grade rating.","Return on invested capital for the first quarter, on a rolling four quarter basis, was 12.75%. On the labor relations front, we are currently negotiating agreements with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Dallas and our Food 4 Less Warehouse Stores in Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates.","Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger\u2019s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, and enhance job security, for our associates.","Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of this year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we\u2019re seeing. As Rodney said, there is a lot of change in the retail food industry. That, coupled with the transition from deflation to inflation creates a challenging operating environment.","The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel. Grocery was essentially flat during the quarter but had fluctuations up and down during it. Meat continued its deflationary trends. And produce, while deflationary for the quarter, showed inflation in the last four weeks of the first quarter and pharmacy was inflationary.","As a result we increased our expectations for LIFO to $80 million; a $55 million increase over our initial expectations. We have also made some incremental investments in price in certain markets that had very hot features on milk and eggs. While this affects gross margin in the short-term, it is less expensive than regaining a customer\u2019s loyalty. These two, plus the incremental investments in hours and wages, are the primary factors causing us to lower our guidance for the year.","Our GAAP net earnings per diluted share guidance for 53 weeks is now $1.74 to $1.79. Our adjusted net earnings guidance range is $2 to $2.05. The previous adjusted net earnings guidance range was $2.21 to $2.25. See Form 8-K we filed this morning for additional information on guidance. Because this is an unusual year, we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate, as we\u2019ve done in the past.","For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the second quarter to be down compared to last year, the third quarter to be up slightly compared to last year, and the fourth quarter to be flat, excluding the 53rd week. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, of flat to 1% growth for 2017. And we continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Over the long term, we remain committed to achieving net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike. We are making the investments necessary to continue being the best food retailer in the country. We know there is a lot of upheaval in the food retail industry. Our strategy is to focus on our customers as their wants and needs change, we\u2019ll be right there with them. We are confident that we will continue winning with our people, our food, and the customer experience, and we will not lose on price.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","John Heinbockel","So guys, just to start off, if you think \u2013 is there any way to quantify maybe directionally the investments in labor, in SG&A versus the investments in price? Labor being some multiples of the investment in price or maybe it's equally split. And then when you think about the investments in price, is a lot of that proactive on your part? You talked about dairy or is that more reactive given what competition is doing?","Rodney McMullen","I'll start and Mike just fill in, the mix between labor and price as you look forward, I would think it's probably pretty close to 50-50 plus or minus 10%. In terms of price, there would be \u2013 as you know, we would not be leaning on price as a strategy, but we're not going to let somebody have price. Now if you look at some of the competitive changes and what we see going on in those situations, we would be proactive versus reactive. And Mike anything you want to add to both of those comments?","Michael Schlotman","No, I absolutely agree. And the whole trick here, John, is how quickly the lines cross on our price investments create more gross profit margin dollars. And as we said in the prepared remarks, there's really two things relative to the labor, one is adding some hours to certain service departments as well as increase in starting wages, which we believe over time will reduce our turnover, which has a great payback when we can have a higher retention of our associates who then are more productive and give a better shopping experience. So that one has a little bit longer runway relative to when we see the benefits of those investments.","John Heinbockel","And then as a follow-up, if you think about what's different versus March, is it primarily the cadence of reflation? And then as you think about \u2013 it does sound like you do expect higher inflation this year than you had before, you didn't reflect that in your comp. Is that just higher cost inflation offset by price investments gets you kind of to a zero net impact from that?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. The biggest thing, if you look in terms of anticipation of identical sales going forward and the improvement of that, we would expect that improvement will continue, but the improvement will be a little bit slower than what we had expected. From an inflation standpoint, Mike, went into a little bit of detail on the LIFO, but that would be a big chunk, obviously the change in LIFO affected, I think, what, Mike, about $0.04 a share as well.","Michael Schlotman","Yes, Rodney, $0.035, $0.04 in that range. John, it's not necessarily that it\u2019s dramatically different today than we\u2019re expecting, but when we look forward based on the movements we\u2019re seeing in the lot of the underlying commodities. We do think there could be a little more inflation by the end of the year than we originally thought, but the accounting convention is whatever your year-end estimate is, you expense that ratably throughout the year. So it's really more reflective of where we think the end of the year is going to be not necessarily what happened in the first quarter, but we\u2019re required to ratably expense that over the year.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Couple questions, I guess, in general since you are taking the opportunity to lower guidance \u2013 I guess I have two questions, one is why not take the opportunity to widen the range to give yourself a little more wiggle room? But, I guess, more importantly why wouldn't you have lower guidance more because if I look at your revised guidance, I still would say this seems pretty optimistic, especially given the competitive landscape has only really just begun to heat up. And within your guidance, originally, there were some assumption that there would be operating expense opportunities and it now sounds like that\u2019s off the table which makes me even more confused about how we get to the full-year numbers?","Michael Schlotman","We talked about all of those and deciding exactly where to set the guidance range. We spend a lot of time taking where we are today, looking at the forecast for the rest of the year, trying to understand the gives and takes and settled on the $2 to $2.05. A wider range, perhaps we could have done that. The only answer I had to that is we decided that we feel good about the range we put out there.","We do feel good about the traction we are getting in ID sales that we think will help us support that ID guidance range. Relative to the operating cost reductions, I think \u2013 I don't have any concern that we aren\u2019t going to continue to get the operating cost reductions we're getting. We have made an independent decision to add some service hours to some departments as well as in some markets increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have, which hurts the customer experience as well as creates its own cost in friction when you are constantly hiring training people.","We didn\u2019t do that across the country. It's in select markets, but it's not an inexpensive proposition. So we try to factor all of those in. In fact, what we call enabler savings are actually pretty close to tracking to exactly what we expected in total to save on our cost savings initiatives for the year.","Rodney McMullen","And couple of other things, Karen to \u2013 and Mike and I both mentioned that our identical sales continue to improve and we would expect that trend to continue. If you look at quarter-to-date and realize it's only three weeks plus a few days, we would be higher than the midpoint of the range that we gave for the year and that\u2019s continued to improve over the first quarter and the first quarter was an improvement over the fourth quarter and it improved during the quarter.","And then Mike\u2019s point on expenses, there were some items where it's more of a one-time type of expense item. If you look at some of the changes in the logistics and some other places, we would expect as we get throughout the year that some of the investments we've made it will flip, so you won\u2019t have the start-up costs. And then if you look at the digital, obviously you have a lot of start-up costs initially when you turn on digital in the store, and if you look at the maturity of those stores over time that becomes a tailwind versus a headwind.","Karen Short","Okay. But just so I understand in terms of the operating expense reductions that you\u2019ve identified that we did not see any of that really in this quarter, but we will see more in the second, third and fourth?","Rodney McMullen","I would say we saw some in this quarter and what we have saved in the quarter and the run rate we have for the year is right in line with what our original expectation in our business plan is. There were other \u2013 as I said that the hours and the dollars investment in starting wages were something that was incremental to the plan, but we think it's prudent to do that.","We try to run the business dynamically and not sit back and say, well, it's not in the plan, so even though we think it's good, we're not going to do it and sometimes those are pluses and sometimes those are minuses. The investments we made in milk and eggs do not lose the customers to people trying to draw our customers into the store. That by itself, if milk and eggs were normal kinds of retails, so we probably would have had positive IDs in the first quarter not negative, which also affected gross margins in the first quarter.","So there's always gives and takes, but we \u2013 the thing we're trying to get across is we've made some conscious decisions to make an incremental investments in our Customer 1st Strategy, plus the effect of [Indiscernible] and higher LIFO charge.","Karen Short","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","Michael Schlotman","Thanks Karen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Zachary Fadem","Hey. Good morning, guys. Is there any color you can provide on the ID sales impact from digital orders at this point? I believe you mentioned you doubled your digital sales, so when looking at your data, how are you thinking about what's incremental versus what might be coming at the expense of in-store volumes?","Michael Schlotman","Yes. It\u2019s a great question Zach and it's \u2013 one of those it's always hard to answer, because you don't know what a customer would have done. The best we can tell, if you would give a range of between 40% to 60%, you\u2019re probably within that range, but it is a hard, hard number to guesstimate, because you really don't know for sure \u2013 incremental or that you would have guided anyway either way.","Zachary Fadem","40% to 60% incremental you said?","Michael Schlotman","Yes.","Zachary Fadem","Okay.","Rodney McMullen","It is clear that those ClickList customers spend incremental dollars with us. To put your finger into the exact number would they have grown their loyalty with us without ClickList perhaps, but you try to take the household trends as a whole and see where they\u2019ve been going and where they are today.","Zachary Fadem","And is it large enough to say that it's having a meaningful impact on the ID sales line yet?","Rodney McMullen","No, when you look at the total, the cost of the startup would be a lot more painful than the tailwind from it. But as you know when we merged with Harris Teeter, Harris Teeter, have been doing it for 10 years and when you look at the maturity that we are having with the Kroger versus the maturity that Harris Teeter had the maturity would be very similar, but it's a headwind for while.","Zachary Fadem","Okay. And I also wanted to address the headlines around all of the Lidl, conceptually how do you think about the role of the hard discounters in the U.S. and how that compares relative to the UK? And in your mind, what are the structural differences between the two markets that you would call out and given that, do you think that those guys would have the same competitive advantages here versus the UK market, any thoughts on that?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, exactly a lot of the question \u2013 couple of things for sure. One, just obviously the sheer size of the countries are different. I think the biggest structural \u2013 I guess two big structural differences, if you look at the cost that it takes to operate a supermarket in the U.S., it's meaningfully less than the UK.","If you look at the price spreads that they're able to achieve in the UK versus the U.S., the price spreads isn't as much either. So you have both from a cost standpoint and a retail advantage for the customer standpoint, not as big as spread.","Also if you look at the base experience of the supermarket in the U.S., we would typically offer more services in terms of every show would have a butcher that's there ready to help. The produce would be much more variety fresher. So there is a lot of aspects from the experience standpoint that would be different in the U.S. than the UK as well.","Zachary Fadem","Okay, that's helpful. Appreciate the time guys.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Kenneth Goldman","Rodney, one of the first things you said and I'll paraphrase was that the environment for food retail has changed, so I guess I\u2019m curious why was it surprising given that to see these hot promotional prices on milk and eggs, shouldn't that have been sort of expected given that the environment has changed or maybe you were talking about something different, which is why I\u2019m asking the question?","And I guess for my follow-up, I'm curious what is in your guidance in terms of what you're assuming for competitive pricing as we look ahead because if things do get worse and as Karen Short was pointing out, they likely will in terms of competition. I just want to understand what you guys are thinking, and how much that's factored into your numbers at this point?","Rodney McMullen","Okay. In terms of the environment is changing, I wouldn't tie directly to milk and eggs. To me that's just one example. But as you know people are changing the way they eat and we're committed and we will support the customer in changing the way they eat. So if you think about the comments on prepared, if you think about the comments on digital and using where our customer can engage with us digitally or in-store, what we find is a customer does both. So it's all of those things together, when I talk about the way customers are eating is changing and we intend to be there and take care of the customer, the way they change. In terms of guidance, Michael you\u2026","Michael Schlotman","Again in response to Karen\u2019s question, you never know when somebody in select markets is going to run some hot feature, and you have to make independent decisions as those features hit the street. Is it somebody just run an ad for a couple of weeks trying to get some business in the store or they going to do something longer term.","And when those kinds of ad stay there for a little bit longer, particularly when it's two important commodities like milk and eggs, ultimately we're going to react and not allow our customers to think they have to go somewhere else to get the best value for those kinds of products.","Just so happens those two commodities are big commodities and its expensive when hot features hit versus some other commodities and to say we do or don\u2019t have something exactly built into our business plan. So that's difficult to say, but we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores.","Rodney McMullen","That's our best guess in terms of what we see happening going forward in terms of at this point in time.","Kenneth Goldman","Can I just sneak one quick one and to make sure I understand is the message of then that and Mike and Rod that is helpful, but is the message of that you can't really predicted, so you're not necessarily factoring in as a general rule, more competitive prices or is the message maybe that you are, but it's harder to be that specific about it?","Michael Schlotman","I think we all believe that the industry is going to continue to get more competitive because every year, it does get more competitive. I think the price investments that we've made so far from our original pricing plan are taking good hold and good effect and we always still dollars in and to try to allow us to react to competitive pressures. So I think the guidance where we've lowered it to certainly have some [indiscernible], everything that may happen. As Rodney said, it\u2019s our best guess at this point in time.","Kenneth Goldman","Understood, thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.","Erica Eiler","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our questions. So I guess should the environment remain challenging from here. Can you maybe just talk about your flexibility to further reduce CapEx and perhaps redeployed buybacks or other avenues to increase shareholder value?","Rodney McMullen","But as you know from a capital investment standpoint, we continue to adjust and over the last year we've reduced the amount that we invest in store increasingly invest increase the amount we're spending from a digital standpoint and infrastructure standpoint. We will always want to keep our stores up-to-date and fresh in terms of the four walls themselves. What we find is that what the customer wants and needs are, it\u2019s constantly changing, so some of the things that I talked about will need to make changes in the store to support that.","If we would believe that we can continue to reduce the amount of capital we're spending, if we're not getting a return on that capital, we would still be looking at it like a hawk in terms of every dollar we spend are we getting a return for that dollar that we're spending and over time does that create value.","As for some reason, it doesn't. We would reduce \u2013 we have continued to increase the focus on the infrastructure, digital and some of the other parts and deemphasized stores in terms of the net new stores. I don\u2019t know Mike, anything you\u2026.","Michael Schlotman","[Indiscernible]","Erica Eiler","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just switching gears to private label. You talked a quite about \u2013 bit about private label in your prepared remarks, seems that a lot of groceries out there or increasingly pushing private label lately, some cases select players that even lowering prices on private label. So are you at all seeing step up efforts from the leading CPG players to support there products whether it's through more promotional dollars or through other avenues? It just seems that there would be much more of sense of urgency at this point, given what seems to be this increase retailer focus on private label?","Michael Schlotman","Yes, well our brand has been incredibly important to Kroger since the founding of the Company. And the research that we did last year, we want to make sure that we weren't just biased because we're so close to it and we did the research with our customers and our customers gave us glowing feedback on how strong our brands were, how great the products were in a blind panel. So they didn\u2019t know it was us.","If you look at our Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic, we just crushed the competitors in that space. So for us, our brands has always been massively important and we will have a world-class our brand approach and it's important for our customers, it's important in terms of being able to make money as well. So we don't look at it in terms of trying to do something versus a CPG, we really look at it is our brand and building our brands and doing the things that customer wants.","Erica Eiler","Okay. Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Tanal","Thanks guys. Good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Stephen Tanal","I'm sort of thinking through the cut to the guide, I\u2019m curious to know how you\u2019re planning food margins for the balance of the year relative to Q1. Do you think the year-on-year gross margin pressure is bottomed are you planning for that to get worse?","Michael Schlotman","Yes, I would say that when we look at gross margins overall, there's a variety of factors that wind up going into that. I think you'll continue to see us over time, reduced gross margins. If you think about my prepared comments over the last 12 years or 14 years, we've invested $3.8 billion in price by the drop we've made in gross margin.","And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down, it\u2019s typically what happens in that any segment of retailing to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter. I probably wouldn't get that specific, but certainly when you look at it over time. We built our business model, assuming that gross margins will go down. We need stronger IDs and we've had the last few quarters and we need to get back of the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin.","Obviously as I said in my prepared remarks, these are representative of the results we expect to deliver over time. But every once in a while you run through cycles, where you have to step back and adjust many of the metrics inside the company and we feel that we've done a good job of react and I'll sensibly and proactively to the environment around us, both from a labor standpoint, from a price investment standpoint and what makes sense to grow the business for the long-term.","Stephen Tanal","I guess two related sort of follow-up questions. The first would be the milk and eggs example. How widespread is that issue? And the second would be maybe qualitatively, as you think about the guidance and passing through the cost inflation that you're seeing, what's generally built in, like how long are you sort of guiding, so that you can hold the line on price longer than you think others well or is that a little different for any reason?","Michael Schlotman","Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, accepting categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making. You typically won't see us anymore maybe in the 1990s we did this. But you won't see the kind of reaction where we have very, very hot features that in the end don\u2019t drive any kind of loyalty in your store and just tries to drive foot traffic and get them to buy other things. Will we react to those types of things and make investments, so that they don\u2019t attracting of our customer stores, absolutely we will. But I think if you look over time, we\u2019ll continue to be proactive on how we make the investments.","Stephen Tanal","Okay, fair enough. And just lastly on meal kits I know it was about four stores some weeks ago, how fast is that being rolled out? How fast can it be rolled out and if you give us a feel for how incremental the sales are maybe how your pricing is versus kind of the group of ingredients in those kits that would be helpful as well? Thanks.","Michael Schlotman","Yes, a great question that I won't get into all the specifics because obviously competitors would appreciate that knowledge as well. What we're finding is the quality of that meal is the same as going to a restaurant and getting the meal, but people like to prepare something at home and they find it easy and they love the variety that we offer.","So lot of the price comparisons is what the prices versus going to a restaurant, but being able to do it at home and when it takes to 20 minutes, it's just as fast as Kroger\u2019s that is going to a restaurant and going through all that household when you're at a restaurant, and we're getting great feedback. We\u2019ll continue to roll it out based on the ability for the facilities to handle the volume, and so far it's been very good and we appreciate and looking forward to work out.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to kind of like broaden out a little bit and try to understand kind of where you guys think your business is and I heard Mike talking about gross margin pressure. As we look at the market, it seems like it's almost like the headline would be more Amazon moving into consumables, more Walmart price investments, more Walmart click and collect, more Aldi, more Lidl.","And so with this natural pressure on gross margins there's also seemingly a natural pressure on cost. And so as you look forward, I know you guys kind of reiterated your 8% to 11% EPS growth rate. I\u2019m just trying to understand over a number of years, how that's going to be possible in this environment. And do you need to make more aggressive, more offensive moves here with the business given this environment?","Rodney McMullen","It's really making sure that we're using the advantages we have, obviously the data that we have. Our average customer only has to drive a mile to get one of our stores. So it's using that personalization to connect with the customer directly on a one-on-one basis and having where they can engage with us anyway they want to, so if they want to pick up their groceries, if they want to delivered or if they want to shop and go at the old fashion way for lack of a better word.","We continue to add services and all of those services as part of the model in terms of making it easy place to stop, so if you think about fuel and some of the others. So it's really the sum of all those pieces together that we're offering and we're doing it in a seamless way.","So I don't disagree with the more and more and more, but there's also things that are a huge advantage for us. And when you look at all those things when a customer comes into our stores, we still give him a great experience on a friendly face. We have incredibly fresh product and it's important for us to continue to improve on those aspect because that's what will be a point of difference.","Scott Mushkin","So my follow-up question would be regarding the scale, this Kroger have enough scale in your minds to compete in this environment against the likes of Walmart and Amazon, which are just produce tremendous amounts of cash both companies. So, I was wondering as you look at the business, obviously you\u2019re a large company, but a lot of investments need to be made, do you need more scale?","Rodney McMullen","From everything - from our perspective, we would have plenty of scale and certainly $115 billion revenue Company, we would have the scale. The other thing is, if you look at like our own brands, the strength of our own brands and the strength of the experience the customers enjoy, all those things obviously add to that scale as well.","Scott Mushkin","All right. Thanks guys. Good luck. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Andrew Wolf","Hi, good morning. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Andrew Wolf","So I just want to clarify, you did say tonnage was positive, but if you just take out the inflation or the deflation rate, it looks like it might have slowed sequentially.","Rodney McMullen","I didn't catch the first part of your question, what was tonnage\u2026","Andrew Wolf","Just want to know if the tonnage slowed and if so \u2013 tonnage growth, you said tonnage growth is positive, but just doing given the numbers you provide us it looks as if it slowed sequentially.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. I\u2019m not going to get into \u2013 we typically don't give exact tonnage numbers and if you at ID sales compared to inflation, deflation it really skewed results when you try to add those two numbers together because of the mix of product that wind up being inside of those categories. When you have inflation in certain categories and deflation in other categories, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison.","Just stepping back from exact tonnage and things like that when you have the number of loyal households we have and you add 3.2% growth in the loyal households and your ID sales with your loyal households is on a positive trend. Those are all great signs of help for our business over time. Without giving \u2013 we're very happy with our unit growth in the first quarter let\u2019s just stay with that.","Andrew Wolf","Okay, great. Last quarter you said whatever market \u2013 the market share growth at least as you've given it out annually was a little less in the 2016 than it had been in prior years. What I am really trying to get to is \u2013 in last quarter you said that was more store-based, your traditional store base competitors running better stores. And meanwhile, you\u2019re talking more about the changing environments, so I just want to check in with you is that still what mainly you see is creating a heightened competitive environment here? Or is it starting to be, as [Scott] was alluding to what's going on digitally whether it's Amazon or other offers?","Rodney McMullen","On the estimating market share as you know is always difficult, but our growth in the first quarter, certainly on the analysis would indicate that our market share growth in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter. And as Mike said, we're pleased with what our unit growth was. We're pleased with our improvement in trend and we're pleased with the improvement in market share trends as well and the lower household growth.","Andrew Wolf","Great. Well that's encouraging. Do you want to comment on weather \u2013 where you\u2019re seeing competitive \u2013 it's obvious the new entrants coming in the market, but some of them are store-based folks like Lidl and Aldi and some are online like Amazon? So just in terms of what you're reacting to and so forth or how do you see things in the future? What is your perspective? Is it still going to be a store-based competitive landscape or do you see being digital including perhaps home delivery with certain click and collect more of Kroger's future really what you're stepping up to?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. If you look, we really see the customer \u2013 all our strategies and things are where do we anticipate the customer going. Everything that we could see and see and doing what we're building our infrastructure for is to be able to serve the customer the way they want to be served. And everything that we can see, we find that the customer likes the combination of everything versus just one approach and we continue to partner with third-party on doing deliveries, we have that in a couple of markets and we continue to expand that. We continue to expand the number of items that are offered and obviously we continue to expand the number of ClickList ExpressLane stores we have.","But everything that we can see the customer wants to shop on their terms, the way they want to, but they still for certain items like to come into a physical store, because they like to interact with people. And we think it's incredibly important to continue to have a strong physical presence, but it's the sum of all parts rather than just each one individually.","Andrew Wolf","Thank for the color. I just want to follow-up if I could on the regional price and hot pricing in dairy. Could you tell us what regions is that more in the east where is a proactive to Lidl's entry more so than not and just generally how widespread that is?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I won\u2019t comment on exactly where we sell, other than it was not concentrated only there.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. Wanted to just go back to the pricing philosophy, obviously been talked about a lot, but I think warranted, given the fact that for investors today probably the line that jumped out most within the release was we will not lose on price. So you talked about obviously being \u2013 certainly a part of that is proactive, I'm sure some of it and given markets is reactive, but can you just give us a little bit better sense on kind of the true kind of philosophy around balancing that kind of strict price versus obviously a lot of the other factors that Kroger has going for it and kind of who that maybe kind of most aimed after, that'd be great? Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I think it's important for people not to over play the price comment. As you know, we do a ton of work on understanding where the customer wants and needs are, and we're incredibly focused on differentiating our experience versus our competitors in terms of the service our associates provide the products and the quality of the products, the quality especially in the fresh areas and produce and meat and seafood and our deli, and the shopping experience itself, so how long does it take me to get into the store?","How long does it take me to get through the checkout line? What type of experience? Those are the things that we're focused on, and that we will differentiate ourselves. We're increasingly differentiating ourselves in terms of the ability to do engage with us anyway you want. Price, we're just making sure we don't lose customers because of price. So it's really \u2013 those pieces together, is where we're focused on and focused on delivering for the customer.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. And maybe just a follow-up to that, maybe more on the promotional environment and obviously a big kind of more theoretical question for everyone on the call is, how much of this is more kind of permanent shifts and pricing versus more of just kind of that weekly blockbuster promotions kind of like what you mentioned.","So I guess how do you think about particularly in the second half of this year with the commodity costs, showing signs of improvement? How much of kind of maybe some of those this weekly promotion did you expect on your side to kind of moderate versus how much of this may just be more kind of permanent in nature? Thanks a lot.","Michael Schlotman","When you look at how people are going to promote and what will be features are going to be, I wouldn't have enough time to step back and think about how our merchants develop their marketing plan, they\u2019re well out, the multiple weeks out. We certainly make assumptions about how customers or how other competitors reacting around holidays, how they may react in weeks, during the summer when there's a lot of vacations going on and maybe fewer people at home shopping and what kind of promotions they may do.","But to be able to sit here and say, this is exactly what we're expecting from a promotional standpoint will be very difficult to say I have X, Y or Z built into the plan. Other than we know there is always going to be markets and there always are markets where there are a lot of hot features going on.","There's other markets that are kind of in the middle, there is high low kind of activity kind of normal traditional grocery store pricing. And then there is other markets that are relatively benign where you go back to daily that fortunately for us, we have the number of markets we're in the breath of those markets that not every market is high for competitive at the same time in some of the ones that aren't quite as competitive help offset that. So to sit here and try to project what the competitive environment are more specifically, the promotional environment maybe would probably not be any significantly prudent.","Vincent Sinisi","Now that's helpful to hear as well. So best of luck. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Kelly Bania","Hi, just some more questions on margins and the price investments. I guess it seems fair to ask where \u2013 of these hot ads are of these traditional supermarkets. Are there any different kind of behavior that you would expect to get better over the next coming quarters from these competitors with these hot ads and I guess as you respond to them, how much of your response in terms of price investments is going in personalized discounts versus your everyday pricing? And are you seeing any different changes in terms of what you would expect in terms of elasticity to those price investments that you are making? Thank you.","Michael Schlotman","I'm not sure exactly where to start on all those questions. At the end of the day, we always assume this industry is going to get more competitive quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out and unfortunately I guess we're really disappointed with the result of our expectation and that's that \u2013 it's always been a competitive market. It's always been a competitive industry.","In our view, it's going to continue to be competitive. There are bursts of time where things heat up and then burst of times where cool down and we know over time that if somebody runs a high feature over the course of the weekend that's one thing.","If somebody appears to be try and to put a stake in the ground on big volume important commodities to drive volume into their stores, the best thing we can do to counteract that is as Rodney say, not lose on price of that commodity, because that takes the advantage away from them and it doesn't get any of our loyal customers or any of our customers, any reason to go anywhere else to shop.","And you have to make judgments throughout the course of a year and a quarter of \u2013 is this a short-term thing somebody is doing that you can not necessarily this way, but by and large ignore or is this something you need to react to? How do you balance that with planned price promotions you have?","Nobody on the call can see the advantage we create with our loyal household with the My Magazine, Rodney talked about or there were 6 million individualized offers in the first quarter alone, but offered those households a different price and everybody sees on their shelf edge.","We do that without creating any kind of price impression amongst our competitors because they don't know we're doing it. But that's the way to be able to reward and give a better price to our most loyal customers without putting it on the front page of an ad and perhaps us causing something like that to happen. So we're constantly using those kind of advantages we have primarily through 84.51\u00b0 to figure out how to reward our most loyal customers the best.","Rodney McMullen","The only other thing I would add Kelly to Mike's point is if you look, typically you'll have consolidation and consolidation happens in spurts and everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out.","And it's one of the things that we think is incredibly important to have the scale that we have and the diversity across the whole country that we have because it allows us to continue to do what's right for our customers. We will continue to work on improving the basic operations and by doing those things. The shareholders continue to get a great return over time as well.","Kelly Bania","Great and I guess my follow-up to that would be just in this environment, are you thinking about M&A any differently that all given what you just said?","Michael Schlotman","I wouldn't say we're thinking about M&A any differently at all. I do agree with Rodney\u2019s assessment of consolidation. I think you'll continue to see us have the opportunity to increase our footprint in markets we're already in by the consolidation of competitors we're going by the wayside, you saw the news reports from earlier in the week in Indiana. And I think there will be a further opportunities like that going throughout the course of the next few years. It's one of the reasons why Rodney\u2019s comment on reducing our capital expenditure on increasing our footprint.","It doesn't worry me too much over the next few years, because I think I can lower my CapEx invested in things are going to drive sales and reduce operating costs and increase my footprint and prices below what it would cost me to build from the ground up. And when they get into those kinds of situations, it sites you really want the fit rate rather than buying an entire chain and trying to do something with that. So I feel really good about that part of what's going on around this.","Kelly Bania","Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","And we have time for one more question.","Operator","And our final question today will come from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Charles Cerankosky","Good morning, everyone.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, Chuck.","Charles Cerankosky","Rodney, could you talk a little bit about how prepared foods did just as a category all the forms and which you sell in market prepared foods did versus a year-ago?","Rodney McMullen","It continued to grow nicely versus a year-ago. It would be one of the strongest departments and it's one of those things, as you know we think it's more and more customers will go in that direction and as you know we went to the upside to hire some talent there and we really feel good about the opportunity in terms of the growth opportunities and we love the progress we're making.","Charles Cerankosky","Is that an area that is going to get more capital dollars when Mike spoke earlier of infrastructure spending?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, they will get more capital dollars, but more importantly, it will get more attention and just the discretionary effort of organization, we will. It's not as capital intensive to make the changes we need to make there. The key thing is changing, and keeping the menus fresh and up to-date and the attention that we spend in that area.","Charles Cerankosky","And then switching to some of the offsets, Mike hinted about operating cost, projects to reduce operating expenses that might be overshadowed this year by some of the wage investments, but could you highlight some of the projects that are going on please?","Michael Schlotman","I wouldn't get through specific. One of the bigger areas that just always particularly of late, we have a lot of projects going on in\/and around shrink, some tests going on and a handful of markets trying to reduce the trends on shrink. It's early on in those handfuls of markets, but early signs are the customers doing seems to be encouraging and hopefully as we get to the end of the year and it starts to be \u2013 end of the year and then the next year something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of the headwind.","Charles Cerankosky","But headwind, you mean the wage investments this year are going to cover up a lot of the other expense reduction efforts?","Michael Schlotman","Or just shrink not being exactly where we wanted in these projects being able to turn the trend on shrink.","Charles Cerankosky","Gotcha. All right, thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Charles.","End of Q&A","Rodney McMullen","Appreciate it. Before we end today\u2019s call, I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, the changes that we talked about today and the direction we're headed in, we're making those changes proactively. And it's really based on where we see the customer is going and we think it's incredibly important to do those changes in advance and we\u2019re massively excited about the growth opportunities for the business going forward, I am we really feel good about our team in terms of the opportunities and taking advantage of those.","So I want to make that. And then I also as you know, I always like to share some comments with our associates listening in. As you\u2019ve heard us describe during this call, we\u2019re focused on executing our Customer 1st Strategy and living our Company\u2019s purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Feed the Human Spirit is our purpose because both our customers and you, our associates, told us it resonates powerfully with you, and also because it is authentic to Kroger it\u2019s who we are.","We\u2019ve been living our purpose in large ways and small for more than 134 years. Whether it is through providing a billion meals to Feed Hungry Families in our neighborhoods over the last four years, committing to being a zero waste company by 2020 or simply extending a smile or a helping hand to a customer, we and you make the world a better place one associate, one customer, one community at a time. Thank you for all you do every day for our customers and each other. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially.

Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","Rodney McMullen ","Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger\u2019s first quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger\u2019s President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Kroger delivered an outstanding first quarter. It is a great start to what we believe will be an another exceptional year. Our associates continue to enhance our connection with all customers and achieve key performance measures, which are allowing us to achieve our growth strategy. We also achieved our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales; exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling four quarter basis; maintained a steady return on invested capital while increasing capital investment. We are achieving synergies from our merger with Harris Teeter. Both Mikes will have more to say about this in a few minutes. And we returned over $1 billion in cash back to our shareholders this quarter through our buyback program.","The staying power of our Customer 1st Strategy and our accelerated growth plan are generating strong momentum. We continue to lower our costs of doing business and to invest those savings both for today\u2019s customers and for future growth. Our strong first quarter results set us up to deliver 12% to 15% net earnings per share growth rate for the year partly due to the benefit of Harris Teeter compared to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% plus the dividend in both cases.","I am also pleased to report that we continue to take meaningful steps to restructure and help secure our associates\u2019 pension obligations for the future. Through two innovative agreements, we plan to move nearly 2,000 associates and retirees to more stable pension plans and 350 associates to a Kroger-sponsored 401(k) plan with a match. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard our associates\u2019 benefits. We are always looking for opportunities that are good for our associates, good for Kroger, and good for our shareholders.","From an economy and customer shopping behavior, we are seeing strong positive indicators in shopping behavior. Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behavior, for example. Consistent with the rise in Consumer Confidence Index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery. While it is obviously welcome news, the recovery remains fragile, especially for customers on a budget. We intend to keep delivering value and improving our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether through our popular fuel rewards program, our Simple Truth offerings, or a more convenient shopping experience, Kroger is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise in any economic environment. And against this backdrop and uneven economic recovery, our team\u2019s excellent first quarter performance stands out in even greater contrast.","Now, I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?","Mike Ellis","Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019d like to congratulate the entire Kroger team for executing our Customer 1st Strategy with precision in the first quarter, which is driving growth and improving our perception in the eyes of our customers. We are connecting better with our customers, showing them we care, and making sure they have a great shopping experience every time. Keeping cost down allowed us to invest strategically and increase customer loyalty.","During the quarter, we grew our number of loyal households at a much faster rate than total household growth, which also was up for the quarter. We saw inflation increase in the grocery category during the quarter. This, combined with higher inflation in meat, produce and pharmacy, has caused us to adjust our view of inflation for the year. We estimate inflation, excluding pharmacy, was 1.8% in the first quarter and 2.1% with pharmacy included. We expect it to be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year as well. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the first quarter.","I will jump to Harris Teeter. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going extremely well. We are spending time with Harris Teeter and learning a lot about how they connect with customers. Their store standards and fresh foods are world-class. And our cultures are a great fit, which makes our integration work rather easy. We are excited by what we are learning about Harris Teeter\u2019s online ordering and store pickup model. It\u2019s a program with a lot of promise.","A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st Innovation. Each quarter, we are highlighting one or more of our innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I will highlight some of the new, exciting work of our Corporate Brands and Kroger Technology teams.","In Corporate Brands, a strategic differentiator for Kroger\u2019s Corporate Brands portfolio is our multi-tier offering. It allows us to offer the right price points and product experiences for everyone. In the first quarter, we introduced new branding and packaging for our Value products, the good tier of our good, better, best program. The new design calls out to customers with attractive uplifting packaging and the response so far has been really terrific. For fresh products, we have replaced Kroger Value with Heritage Farm. The name better reflects the inherent quality of the brand and we are already seeing positive acceptance from our customers. Corporate Brands had a solid first quarter accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.2% of total units sold and 24.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","Kroger Technology is our team of technology innovators and inventors. They are implementing a fundamental foundational technology that we can leverage to create the Internet of Things in the retail environment. One tangible example of this is real-time temperature monitoring in our supermarkets. Today, temperature checks are performed manually by our associates. But by using interactive sensors that are connected through an in-store network, we can better ensure the freshest foods by allowing for more frequent, real-time temperature checks of meat, produce, deli and frozen food products. And we love these kinds of initiatives because they save money and they free up time for our associates to engage with customers. And most importantly, this technology will help improve our already vigorous food safety efforts. We plan to continue leading the adoption of the Internet of Things in our stores.","Now, I will give a brief update on labor negotiations \u2013 labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Atlanta and Southern California, as well as for non-food associates in Portland, Oregon. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Cincinnati, New Mexico, Toledo, and parts of California and an agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates.","Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective knowing Kroger\u2019s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, and enhance job security for our associates.","Now, Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger\u2019s financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Mike and good morning everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets; leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs, through both traditional and digital channels; and continuing to deliver shareholder value through our share buyback program and dividend. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 Investor Conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.","Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter ID sales growth of 4.6%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding, double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and general merchandise departments also posted strong ID sales growth and Kroger\u2019s pharmacy department continued its strong performance.","Rolling four quarters, FIFO operating margin, on a 52-week basis and excluding fuel and the pension agreements, increased by 12 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling four quarters basis. Until we have Harris Teeter in both the current and base years, the expected increase will be higher than our long-term guidance, which is slightly expanding. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling four quarters basis.","The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a 52-week rolling four quarters basis of 13.5%, which is consistent with ROIC during the same period last year. As we increased capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near-term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. As Mike and Rodney have already said and our integration with Harris Teeter is well underway and we are achieving synergies in multiple fronts. One great example was combining insurance programs, which has reduced our annual premiums by $6 million already.","Now, I will share our first quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this is the first period that includes Harris Teeter in Kroger\u2019s statement of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $501 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates\u2019 future benefits, as described in yesterday\u2019s press release. Excluding the effect of these charges, Kroger\u2019s adjusted net earnings were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the first quarter. Net earnings in the same period last year were $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share.","As Mike Ellis said, we are seeing higher inflation than anticipated. We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $17 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $90 million. Our previous LIFO guidance for the fiscal year was a charge of $55 million. This affects the year by about $0.04. FIFO gross margin increased 1 basis point from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative costs plus the rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, declined 9 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year\u2019s first quarter.","Now, for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.131 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment grade rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, and fund increasing capital investments.","Kroger remains committed to achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to EBITDA ratio by mid-to-late 2015. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and realized no incremental EBITDA in fiscal 2013, because the transaction closed late in the fiscal year. This has a material effect on the company\u2019s net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.42 times compared to 1.85 during the same period last year. As we get a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA in the calculation, we expect to be closer to 2.2 times by the end of the year. Kroger\u2019s net total debt is $11.3 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago. This is a result of the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger\u2019s share repurchase activity.","Kroger\u2019s strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 25.7 million common shares for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $709 million for the first quarter compared to $640 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014.","Now, I\u2019d like to update our growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings guidance to a range of $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. The original guidance was $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. The company\u2019s long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance remains at 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel to 3% to 4% for fiscal 2014, including Harris Teeter. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%.","And now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Mike. What a terrific start to our year. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going exceptionally well. We are learning a lot from Harris Teeter associates and our business is performing well. And we are even more excited about Harris Teeter\u2019s people and the opportunities today than we were when we first merged. Across our company, our associates\u2019 remarkably consistent execution continues to generate consistently remarkable results for our shareholders. We will continue building on this resilient foundation to grow aggressively into the future.","And now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Hey, guys. So, a couple of things. Obviously, it\u2019s a little hard to tell with Harris Teeter mixed into the numbers, but if I try to back that out and think about ex-fuel gross margin decline, it looks about what it\u2019s been running or maybe just slightly higher than it\u2019s been running? And I ask that because I am curious what you see with regard to inflation today, is that being passed along fairly quickly or given your value position, you are delaying some of that for weeks or maybe even months?","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, John. Yes, it\u2019s been on \u2013 breaking it out, you would be correct, if without Harris Teeter, the trends would be very similar to what they have been running. From an inflation standpoint, we pass it along some of it in terms of obviously how is the competitive environment going and also the inflation that we think is just a seasonal type inflation or something that\u2019s longer term. And I would say in our ability to pass it through, it\u2019s pretty much similar to what it\u2019s been running. And I don\u2019t know Mike or Mike anything you want to add to that?","Mike Schlotman","No.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then as a follow-up, when I think about your price investments, right, and I don\u2019t know what inning we are in, but how do you think about it now in terms of investing by category, right. So, I know you made investments in natural foods. Are there more categories where you need that type of work, it doesn\u2019t look like there is or is it solely items? And then how do you think about private label, price investments in private label and when you think about that, do you look at the private label spread versus the brand or do you actually go out and look at what other retailers are retailing their private label products at?","Mike Ellis","Well, the first question on overall price investment, we are continuing to look at the markets we do business in and deciding where we want to be positioned. Also, we look at categories within the store and try to determine where we want to be priced relative to competition or the market, but private label, there are several ways to look at private label pricing, one would be \u2013 it would be how it\u2019s related to the branded product. And in some cases, it might be priced with the competition in a way that keeps us on our pricing strategy and keeps us relevant. And it really depends upon the item and the market.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","But do you think we are talking about items now, most of your category adjustments have been made or you disagree with that?","Mike Ellis","We have been through most categories and made some sort of adjustments over the last several years in pricing, but we were still looking at pricing overall and where we positioned it and making decisions on where we want to be.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay, thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John.","Operator","And the next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hey, thanks for the question. Forgive me if you mentioned this, can you estimate even if it\u2019s just a rough number what weathers tailwind was on your comps in 1Q?","Mike Ellis","It\u2019s really tough. If you look at the cadence of comps during the first quarter, the first four weeks of the quarter were a little bit stronger than the rest of the quarter, but not remarkably high. And the second, third and fourth periods, the second and third were affected by the Easter shift. If you kind of normalize Easter between the two periods, they were very, very close to one another. So, I don\u2019t think there was a huge bump in the first quarter as a result of whether it certainly helped, but it\u2019s not what made the 4.6% strong, the second, third and fourth on a combined basis certainly contributed to the results as well.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay. And then as we look at your comps into 2Q, so any particular headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about just a little more color on how things are progressing so far this quarter, just curious on those lines?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. We wouldn\u2019t see anything unusual versus what it\u2019s been running. And we would continue to be slightly above our guidance range in terms of so far this quarter. And it\u2019s very similar to the first quarter.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","One last quick one, it\u2019s a bit tricky because of the different days in the quarter in Harris Teeter, I just want to make sure, your D&A was up 12% year-on-year, your interest expense was up 14% year-on-year, are these roughly the growth rates we should be modeling for the rest of the year on a year-on-year basis?","Mike Schlotman","For the year on a year-on-year basis, yes, they will be in that kind of the range because of the Harris Teeter depreciation as well as the debt we took on for Harris Teeter. And then obviously next year, we will return to more normal level. The other one that\u2019s a little different than what we have historically reported is ramp as a rate of sales, because the large majority of the Harris Teeter stores are at least not owned like ours. So that affects that line as well and we break that line out separately.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Great, thanks very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Ken.","Operator","And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to delve a little bit more into the upside in the quarter, so you beat the high end of your guidance I think by about a few pennies, was that all driven by sales upside or are there other things in play?","Rodney McMullen","The sales piece would be by far the biggest driver of the upside.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Okay.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. And just to clarify we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, so we only give an annual guidance. So, the only thing you can compare to is what the Street expectations were.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then you also mentioned that you are seeing better signs of a consumer this quarter, what are you seeing more in some of your discretionary areas of the business?","Rodney McMullen","Well, we have really seen \u2013 I mean, if you look it\u2019s continuing a good solid trend. It\u2019s always hard to define what\u2019s discretionary, but certainly if you look at what areas people cutback on first we continue to see strong growth on that across the board. I don\u2019t know Mike anything you want to add to that?","Mike Ellis","No. That pretty much sums it up. There has been some mixed changes in what people are buying it looks like, but overall it\u2019s been strong all across the board.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Okay, thank you and good luck. Nice quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse","Hi. This is actually Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just a quick question. Can you remind us what percent of your stores have heavier mix of natural and organic selection and where that number could potentially go to? And then also if you see a comp lift when you add \u2013 when you sort of bulk up that offering in your store?","Rodney McMullen","Well, I don\u2019t know if there is any particular area that has a higher mix of natural foods. We tend to \u2013 it\u2019s a strategy for the company to improve our natural foods offering across the country. So, any of our new stores or remodels we try to be more aggressive on natural foods positioning and the amount of products we carry, but \u2013 so it\u2019s pretty much throughout the country. And it is a \u2013 it\u2019s definitely a strategy of ours and it\u2019s really connecting both customers right now.","Mike Ellis","And it\u2019s not always, pretty much every store has some offering of natural and organic products, but we are finding it as much a lifestyle decision as it is a demographic driven topic. And people of all demographics are choosing a healthier lifestyle. So, we actually have the product and really, I can\u2019t think of stores I go into that don\u2019t have some. Now, the size of the store can dictate how much you have, but it\u2019s a broad appeal product.","Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just a quick one, can you update us on your total MEPP liability?","Mike Ellis","I don\u2019t remember what it is off the top of my head. It was in our 10-K and the MD&A. I don\u2019t want to guess the number, because I will be guessing wrong. You can follow-up with Cindy and I after the call.","Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks for taking our questions.","Mike Ellis","It was in the MD&A and our 10-K.","Lauren Wood - Credit Suisse","Thanks.","Mike Ellis","Yes.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a housekeeping item first before I got into my bigger question. The ROIC calculation you guys ran in the report, it seems like and maybe I am wrong, but basically Harris Teeter is reflected in the denominator, but the numerator is not pro forma or my \u2013 or is it?","Mike Ellis","Okay. So, you are correct, Scott. And you also noticed that we went to one decimal place instead of two decimal places. So, the way that works it\u2019s rolling four quarters calculations. So, your denominator becomes the average assets at the beginning or the end of the year. So, you effectively have half of Harris Teeter\u2019s assets in there because of that averaging, but only one quarter of their EBITDA. We will get more and more of their assets and more and more of their EBITDA as we go throughout the year. So, we did in a couple of ways. If you look at it just the way this calculation is it was about a 2 basis points down. If you pro forma Harris Teeter in there for the whole timeframe, it was about 2 basis points up. So, we just decided that rather than try to confuse it, we are going to call it the 13.5 until the end of the year and then we will go back to two decimal places, I would think.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay, perfect. Thank you for that clarification. So then the second question is actually more of a strategy question. I mean, you look at the broader food landscape here and I think you guys just outcomped Whole Foods, if I am not wrong about that, but on the other side of the equation, you are clearly outcomping Wal-Mart. You have a format now and probably the best high-low operator out there, you got big data. When do we \u2013 and you just bought Harris Teeter, but when do you put this more aggressively on the road, I think you are in 34 states now, when does Kroger really start to drive even more growth? I mean, clearly you are taking enormous market share where you are either through more M&A or more aggressively venturing into places you are not?","Rodney McMullen","Scott, as you know, if you look at our fill-in markets, that is the first part of that and it\u2019s really if we look at the returns from that, the higher our market share, the higher our ROIC. So, that\u2019s really the first phase of that is we are increasingly getting aggressive on fill-in markets. And that\u2019s we are very pleased with the early result. In terms of new markets, by merging with Harris Teeter, we really view that is going into several new markets. And as I mentioned in the call, one of the things that we are really excited about is the market share opportunity, growth opportunities that Harris Teeter has. And we will aggressively partner and support growing in several of those markets as well. So, from our perspective that is going on the road with it in the context of where we think we see the highest return with the capital that we have allocated.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Maybe a chance we get a bump in the growth rate that you have out there, 8% to 11%, I think you have been exceeding now for a while?","Mike Ellis","We are not even two years in the 8% to 11%, Scott. Let us get comfortable and used to this one for a little bit.","Rodney McMullen","But as you know, the key to our growth rate is being sales led and growing our business and then continuing to execute against our model. So, I agree with Mike give us a little time, but that\u2019s really how we are trying to drive to grow our business.","Mike Ellis","It\u2019s one thing to announce investments in October \u201812. It\u2019s another thing to begin making those. And then it\u2019s another thing again for them to come out of the ground and start generating sales and EBITDA. So, there is a lag from when you make the announcement until you get there. Keep in mind, our share buyback in the first quarter is very strong. That was contemplated in our guidance. And we told everybody in October \u201812 for the first couple of three years, a third to half of our growth was going to come from share buyback until our investments started to mature. So, we will have to wait for that tipping point happen, Scott and see where we are at that point in time.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Alright, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Scott.","Operator","And next we have a question from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just on the comps looking at the numbers that Harris Teeter reported last year, it looks like I mean they actually had some pretty decent comps throughout last year, right up until their third quarter. So, I am kind of wondering if you could give some color on what the impact for Harris Teeter was on your comps?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. We won\u2019t give specifics. Obviously when we talked in the fourth quarter, we said we would \u2013 we gave guidance with Harris Teeter in it. We were pleased with where Harris Teeter\u2019s numbers was. It was consistent with the budget and that\u2019s true for EBITDA as well, but I won\u2019t give specifics in terms of how it affected the overall total Kroger number other than it wasn\u2019t much.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I know you obviously gave color on your inflation in the current quarter, what are your expectations on inflation for the whole year or the full year?","Mike Ellis","Yes. We are kind of expecting in the range where we saw in the first quarter to hold true for the year. I figured inflation was going to come back up again, so actually flipped to a page in our \u2013 you have seen me carry my blue book around in the conferences, Karen.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Yes.","Mike Ellis","If you look at some interesting things and without fuel and pharmacy, last year\u2019s inflation cadence was 1.7, 1.6, 1.5 and 0.8. And everybody is concerned about inflation right now in our first quarter and that same metric was 1.8. Grocery inflation in this year\u2019s first quarter was actually lower than grocery inflation in last year\u2019s first quarter. And pharmacy and meat and produce are basically in the same range. So, this isn\u2019t a world we have lived in and it\u2019s not a huge shift really from where we were about the same time last year. We are comfortable managing the business and in an inflationary environment like we have today and think we are going to see this continue, there are some grain prices out there that are favorable. Milk looks like it\u2019s peaked and it\u2019s going to start to come down a little bit, which will help the grocery inflation index, because that\u2019s where we classify milk and we talk about inflation. So, we think it\u2019s going to be pretty comparable to where it is today.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","The blue book came in handy. Thanks. Thanks for that color.","Mike Ellis","This is why I carry it.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","And then just the last question, it looks obviously you gave your dollar amounts at a buyback, but it looks like you are done, pretty much done with your authorization. So, any comments on that?","Mike Ellis","We did have our expectation and our guidance for the year contemplated a front end buyback program. It is somewhat unusual first to go without any kind of an authorization. What I would say is unless there is I wouldn\u2019t expect significant incremental buyback activity for the rest of the year.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Great, that\u2019s helpful.","Rodney McMullen","And it\u2019s really left up to our board on the approval.","Mike Ellis","Right.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Karen.","Operator","And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Hey, guys. Thanks. I am going to probably talk about something a little bit bigger picture. I was very intrigued by the commentary about pension and specifically that you had some employees a small number, but some employees shift to a 401(k) plan with matching and also that you moved a much larger group of employees to a different plan, could you just talk a little bit about kind of what the discussions were? Why would somebody move away from a defined benefit plan and what do you think the prospects are for other people recognizing the value of 401(k)?","Mike Ellis","Yes. There were clearly a couple of different moves here, Meredith, both of which came together in the same quarter. The folks in the Pacific Northwest, there were actually two separate moves with those folks. They are continuing, their accrued liability moved into the consolidated UFCW plan that we established a couple of years ago. So, we took their historical liability that they have already earned into that company managed UFCW plan. Their future benefits are being accrued in the sound plan and it\u2019s not a sound plan from the financial standpoint, although it\u2019s very well funded. It\u2019s called the sound fund in the Pacific Northwest. So, that was a group of retail associates.","The second move was a group of King Soopers pharmacists who happen to be unionized. Same thing, we moved their obligation and it was actually through the negotiating process with them, where they have the desire to go into our 401(k) plan and be able to manage their investments themselves and accrue those dollars and move them around as they see fit. And it was \u2013 that one was really associate-driven at the negotiating table. I will tell you we have some high level talent dedicated to this effort. In fact, if you remember a year or so ago, we moved Scott Henderson, who was our Treasurer and he spends a good chunk of his time when he manages our entire pension investment program, both of the \u2013 all three of the K plan, the company plan and the UFCW plan as well as spends a lot of time with our labor negotiators trying to do this. Our view is we are trying to be proactive on this front, not reactive. And we think by being proactive, it\u2019s the best thing for our associates not only for the pension they have already earned, but for the pension that they would expect to earn going forward.","Rodney McMullen","And Scott and Mike working with our labor negotiators and the union, they understand the opportunity and need for this. And this really does improve the quality of the benefits our associates have and improves the security of their ultimate benefit. So, it\u2019s one of those things where the union is also working with us on these, but it\u2019s a lot of work and a lot of effort.","Mike Ellis","It happens slowly.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","And I guess it\u2019s fair to say that repeating what you did with the pharmacists maybe unusual because they are a unique group of employees?","Mike Ellis","Perhaps. You never know what\u2019s going to happen in the negotiation. All I know is the unions and Kroger both have the desire to continue conversations to try to come up with creative solutions to help secure the benefits they have already earned and give them a decent benefit approval going forward as well.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","That\u2019s great. And then I am going to just switch gears talking about fuels, you had \u2013 it looks like it was pretty attractive margin on fuel this quarter and I assume that\u2019s because prices were coming flat or coming down. Is that fair to say and kind of what\u2019s your outlook if you can have an outlook about fuel prices for the rest of the year? And also did it contribute to earnings per share in any kind of a meaningful way?","Mike Ellis","What we always say about fuel is one thing we will guarantee and that is it will be volatile. It was volatile inside the quarter. There were days and weeks where we were not as thrilled with our fuel results. And then there were days and weeks where we are very thrilled with our fuel results. Relative to the retail price per fuel in quarter one on a total company basis, fuel, supermarkets and convenient stores combined, the average retail price per gallon last year was 3.50 to 4 and this year was 3.45 to 6. So, it was actually a little bit lower on a combined basis between the two years. And the cost was actually about the same amount, maybe just a touch amount lower as well. So, it\u2019s \u2013 and we had very, very strong gallon growth, almost 6% gallon growth.","Rodney McMullen","It was \u2013 it helped the quarter, but it wasn\u2019t the driver for the quarter, by no means. And as you know, we always budget fuel margins kind of the same this year as the prior year. And over time that always seems to come out pretty close to right. Along the way, there is, as Mike mentioned, quite a bit of volatility.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Right. And then I am just going to fill in one more quick question I think I just didn\u2019t hear what was said about pharmacy and what pharmacy maybe to comps and anything else about pharmacy profitability, I don\u2019t know if you made a comment, some stuff broke up when I was listening to it?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. I made a comment when I spoke about ID sales for the quarter that they continued their strong performance both from a script count and the sales count, sales basis. So, good ID sales growth in dollars and scripts.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Meredith.","Operator","And next question we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a one follow-up on the inflation questions that you have been getting, with meat rising really quite rapidly the last couple of months and the quarter coming out okay on gross margin and you guys saying your survey works looks like your customers are loosening up their pocket books. Are you seeing a lot less change in behavior in terms of trading down in proteins and into lower quality meats and stuff like that? And well, that\u2019s really the question. So, it\u2019s kind of a pass-through and are you able to pass it through in a sort of more reasonable way than you would one or two years earlier than when that type of thing happened? And how is the consumer reacting to that?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at meat specifically, you can clearly see behavior changes as prices increase. So people buying more cube steaks or buying more hamburger, those kind of things you can clearly see. The comment on the customer overall is very broadly in terms of if you look at what they are doing in total, we feel very good about and we like what we are seeing in terms of the customer in total being willing to spend a little bit more.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And I wanted to ask just a follow-up on Harris Teeter, I know you guys do a lot of survey work with customers and Harris Teeter has a pretty rich loyalty card as well? Have you been able to do any survey work with their customers? And could you reveal what it is you might have heard from them in terms of maybe in terms of the four Ts that you guys go to market with or that kind of thing? I know at a conference recently you said perishable pricing was the focus for example?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. If you look at obviously Harris Teeter has done customer research for years and before in a couple of markets, we would have our customer research on Harris Teeter just because they were somebody else in the market. Harris Teeter scores incredibly strong on people and products and freshness of products. So, when you look at produce meat, deli department, they score very well and their associates are very friendly. And that\u2019s really their strong suit. And we would expect when we start doing the combined research that, that\u2019s consistent with the research Harris Teeter has done before, we would expect to see the same.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","And were they scoring well, let\u2019s say, in some of that merchandising and maybe customer interaction as well, is that something where that can be integrated into all or parts of Kroger or is it just too much of a task for given the size differential between the two companies?","Rodney McMullen","Mike Ellis on this prepared comments talked about a little bit. I can tell you that Mike Ellis and the operators are spending quite a bit of time trying to understand exactly how Harris Teeter does that. And Mike you are in the middle of all that.","Mike Ellis","Well, it\u2019s really been fun to have someone who was a competitor that you admire. And now you can actually see what they do, how they do it, but as Rodney mentioned, they have been really strong on some of the matrix better than us in several markets. And so to learn how they do, what they do has been actually really a lot of fun and we are integrating some of that into some of our operations today throughout Kroger.","Andrew Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","I look forward to hearing more about that. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Andrew.","Operator","And our next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I guess turning back to the guidance given the big buyback upfront it looks like the year seems a bit of a change in the margin on a standalone basis even when factoring in the high LIFO charge. I know you don\u2019t like to get into this much, but can you talk qualitatively about your underlying gross margin given the OG&A assumptions in the back half and any unusual shift we should be expecting?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t get that granular. The closest I will come is we did make comments about operating profit and as we get a full year of Harris Teeter into the numbers, we would expect our operating profit margin to not be the 12 basis point rolling four quarters increase we had in the first quarter, but as get a full year of them in we would expect it to come closer to the slight increase that we project overall.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I think the other thing that I guess Kroger has been doing, it\u2019s a little bit different than other areas and retail is moving towards a few of the larger format stores, marketplace stores. As you look at general merchandise, which has been shifting online and you learn from click and collect at Harris Teeter, how are you thinking about the opportunity to offer general merchandise at a broader group of stores with the web and what are the implications for sales per square foot?","Rodney McMullen","Well, all of our large stores have some selection of general merchandise, including apparel and all of our future plans and remodels that we are working on. And we are really pleased with the results, pleased with sales per square foot and pleased with customers\u2019 reaction to the product offering. So, it is part of our strategy going forward.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","And for the smaller stores, is there an ability right now to actually have click and collect on general merchandise?","Rodney McMullen","Not today.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Would it take so much?","Rodney McMullen","We would expect to take the Harris Teeter click and collect as Mike mentioned other \u2013 to do it in an another market. We like what we are seeing there.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks. Best of luck.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Stephen.","Operator","And our next question is from Jason DeRise of UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Hi, it\u2019s Jason DeRise. Wanted to ask on natural foods obviously growing double-digits, can you share what it contributed to the 4.6% comp?","Rodney McMullen","We really wouldn\u2019t get into that level of detail in terms of how much of the 4.6% is driven by that. Mike did mention that all departments were positive identicals.","Mike Ellis","All departments and all geographies.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. So, it\u2019s broad-based. So that isn\u2019t the thing that\u2019s driving it, but obviously a nice growth.","Jason DeRise - UBS","And when you look at your customer data, do you think that this is a customer who is just entering the category in a more meaningful way now that you are offering it or do you think that you are perhaps this is sales that previously were outside of Kroger at maybe a specialty store now that shopper is deciding to that trip at Kroger solely?","Rodney McMullen","I think it\u2019s all the above. There has been lower prices in lot of areas in natural foods, so it\u2019s I think to bring new customers to the category, but certainly people are more health conscious for their family and the things that they consume. So, lot of our customer insights are driving lot of the decisions on what we carry and what we put into our stores. And there are customers, is shouting that this is something they are really interested in. So, it\u2019s a big focus by us \u2013 for us.","Jason DeRise - UBS","I think it is maybe a year or two ago, there was a lot of talk about how Kroger only has half of their customers grocery spend. How has that trended since the efforts in natural foods and other categories to try to win more of that share?","Rodney McMullen","And Jason, it\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s one that if you could \u2013 if you were in the room you would see us smiling at each other, because it\u2019s pretty similar to what it was, because the fortunate part we keep adding new customers. So, if you look at the loyal shoppers that have been loyal for a while we continue that 50% would probably be more like 70% to 75%, but fortunately, we keep growing our customers. So, you have new loyal customers coming in. So, when you look at the blend of existing loyals and new loyals, it\u2019s still around the 50%.","Mike Ellis","Yes. If you look at ID loyal customers, it will be much higher than 50%, but the good news is we keep adding people that become loyal below the 50%. So, it dilutes the total back down.","Rodney McMullen","Obviously, natural foods helps on that, but it\u2019s really across the whole store that we are picking up that customer including the fresh departments produce meat, deli bakery, seafood.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay, great. And I guess I just wanted to see if I can put this in there on Harris Teeter, would you quantify just the EPS accretion for the quarter, just so that we can sanity check the original guidance on that?","Rodney McMullen","You should assume that our original guidance, our updated guidance would have the same base assumptions for the Harris Teeter contributions to the year.","Mike Ellis","I did mention that Harris Teeter is performing consistent, a little bit better, but not a lot in terms of the analysis that we used when we are working on the merger. So, we are pleased with where they are tracking and they would be consistent with what we shared with them.","Rodney McMullen","We are right on track with what our expectations were.","Jason DeRise - UBS","I mean, there has been in the press, I guess that part of it\u2019s your press, but that the Harris Teeter started dropping prices, similar type of press releases that you would see coming out of other Kroger banners on this. And so, that\u2019s I guess is there anything you could share about how that\u2019s gone? Is that what\u2019s driven maybe a bit more of the upside, the response to that or is that not where the incremental upside has been?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. It\u2019s really very, very early in that process. And what we are doing is the synergies as we accomplish them, Harris Teeter is taking that money and giving it back to the customers. So, it\u2019s really given the customer something back from the merger and some of the savings and Mike mentioned insurance, for example.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Mike Ellis","Thanks, Chuck.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Chuck.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Looking again at the pension benefit announcements you have made the other day, like I\u2019d like to get a better idea on how the cash flows are going to look on this. You are obviously not going to pay $56 million immediately, but at the same time, how might that be broken up over the next five years or so as it moves into the funds? And is there a corresponding offset in your hourly contribution of these plans?","Mike Schlotman","Couple of questions there. So, the $56 million is the after-tax cash we will have to put in. And as we said we have up to five years to do that. We really haven\u2019t decided exactly how we are going to do it. The King Soopers pharmacist is a smaller part of that total contribution and we actually have longer than five years to do theirs, but you should expect some plan over the five years to do it. What this really does is technically what happened is assets and liabilities came attached to their already earned and accrued benefits. And that\u2019s what we are shoring up in these plans. Going forward, they will continue to earn benefits. In the pharmacist case, they will get a K plan match. In the clerk\u2019s \u2013 in the Pacific Northwest contract, they will continue to earn the benefit going forward and there will be cents per hour accrual for those benefits going forward. So, it won\u2019t reduce that.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So that the $56 million is to shore up the plans and whatever is negotiated going forward is an additional pennies per hour kind of deal?","Mike Schlotman","Now, what we don\u2019t have to negotiate and we are about funding going forward is any cents prior to make up the $56 million, because we will do that separately. So, going forward, any portion of an hourly contribution that was there to make up an under funding in the plan, obviously we have already negotiated that and walled it off. So, all we have to worry about funding is future benefit accruals, not vested benefit accruals that will be separate.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And announcements of this sort are likely to recur, but it\u2019s very difficult to forecast when and how frequent, is that a fair statement?","Mike Schlotman","Predict when and how and it\u2019s one of the reasons we had a disclosure of this kind of activity in our outlook section in the 10-K, because that\u2019s why we dedicated some very talented resources to this, because we would love to continue to pick off opportunities like this to secure \u2013 to help secure the pension benefits of our associates going forward. And some of these under funded plans get that out of that fund, if that fund runs into trouble. We know our associates are taken care of, because we have them in a fund that we are helping manage and we do view that what we have is an obligation to do that for them.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Yes, thanks Chuck.","Operator","And the next question is from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi","Yes, good morning and many thanks for taking my question here. And (indiscernible) has recently indicated that they had seen a pickup in competitive activity, not only obviously in their home markets with the expansion of Albert Heijn stores, but also in some U.S. markets. Should we read into that, that you perhaps have sharpened a little bit your pricing already with Harris Teeter given that they do compete with the Food Lion stores in a number of markets?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. As I mentioned before, that is a good assumption, but it\u2019s just early in that process.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi","Okay. And then just a follow-up if I may. I may have missed this, but following the announcements yesterday, have you indicated by how much your multi-employer liability will shrink on the balance sheet?","Rodney McMullen","Well, that amount we put in the MD&A is not entirely on our balance sheet. And theoretically, it would be reduced by the $56 million once we fund it. That $56 million will actually now sit as the liability in our balance sheet until we do fund it.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi","Okay, great. Thanks very much for the color today.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. Thanks Filippe.","Operator","And next we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on your comp guidance, you clearly raised it, first quarter was strong, it sounds like second quarter\u2019s running strong as well. And you talked about a little bit of a less cautious consumer behavior, which I don\u2019t think I have heard you guys say for a while and upticking inflation. So, just curious if there is any conservatism in that 3 to 4 kind of outlook for the rest of the year or any other things that we should be thinking about getting back to a 3 to 4 range?","Rodney McMullen","The one thing that if you look at last year by quarter, the fourth quarter actually was a little better than the trend had been. It wasn\u2019t driven by weather, but it was helped by weather. And as we start cycling some of those things until you actually cycle them, obviously you don\u2019t know where you are. Now, we will always hope that we are a little conservative, but until you get there it is our best estimate at this point in time. Mike or Mike you want to agree completely?","Mike Ellis","I would agree completely also.","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","Great. And if I could just add another question on natural foods, clearly up strong again. Just curious as you look at your competition whether it\u2019s discount channel or supermarkets or elsewhere, do you see them investing as much as you are in natural product categories? I mean, I realize Wal-Mart has announced the Wild Oats line. We haven\u2019t really seen that show up in stores yet, but do you think some others could start to invest more in natural foods as well or what are you seeing versus your competition?","Rodney McMullen","Well, there is investment. We are seeing competitive investment in natural foods. For us, we have positioned natural foods in different parts of the store now. You will find soy milks, almond milks in the regular dairy case and things like that. So, we are just trying to answer what the customer wants and have products available at a price that they are willing to pay and in a location that they are happy to find them. So \u2013 but competitively, yes we have seen a little bit of move, but not much.","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","Great, thanks.","Rodney McMullen","We have time for one more question. Thanks Kelly.","Operator","Thank you. And that question will come from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for squeezing me in. So, just actually had a bigger picture question, as you look at your overall store base whether you think you will see a net increase in competitive openings against you this year or if it\u2019s consistent you think with last year or maybe offset by closures at weaker chains. Obviously, it doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting your comps this quarter, but just curious how you see that playing out this year?","Rodney McMullen","It\u2019s a good question. And you continue to see a lot of people talk about adding square footage in the space. Some of that square footage is dedicated to what we sell in the side of a different format be it inside of a Dollar General store or a drugstore or something like that. Wal-Mart is obviously building some smaller neighborhood and kind of markets. So, that\u2019s there. What kind of gets lost is competitors who are closing stores that I would call versus a small offering inside of another format, what I would call a destination store. So, when you have a destination store closing, it\u2019s 50,000 or 60,000 square feet and somebody else has added 1,200 square feet, that\u2019s really a convenient shop. It\u2019s a different kind of competitor. So, I think we will continue to see a lot of square footage open up that sells food. I think overall, the destination kind of square footage is probably flat to slightly down.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just one other quick one, I saw that you recently introduced a premium pet food assortment which sounds like it could be a nice incremental comp driver for you guys. I was wondering how many stores that\u2019s in today and maybe how many you are planning by year end? And then it also sounds like maybe along with that there has been a change in the receptivity of premium pet food brands distributing to the supermarket channel?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. We just recently introduced, I am glad you caught that, a new line of premium pet foods and it should be in every store in Kroger I would hope that was the plan and sales have started out strong and we are real pleased with it. Glad you caught that.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","I try. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen ","Thanks Kate. Before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Earlier this month, we introduced the Taste of M\u00e9xico event in all our stores. We hope our associates are enjoying this fun celebration of Mexican food with our customers, including in-store sampling, creative displays and special activities. I know I have enjoyed visiting our stores across the country and seeing the creativity, passion and enthusiasm from our associates for the Taste of M\u00e9xico. This special event is the first of a series of celebrations of foods of the world in our stores and runs through June 24.","Our associates\u2019 passion for doing good is evident in the way we serve our customers and neighbors in the communities where we live and work everyday. This month, we honor our associates\u2019 efforts in serving our communities and those in need. We are pleased to recognize in our 2013 Annual Report 28 associates across the company for their outstanding volunteer service as recipients of the Kroger\u2019s 2013 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent to honor veterans, feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer, and bring music to mentally-challenged among many other causes. We are grateful for their commitment. A big heartfelt thank you to all of our associates who volunteer. Mike and I are proud of the work you do.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Schlotman, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.","J. Michael Schlotman","Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Cindy can't join us today, so I'm going to do the introductory comments. Her daughter, Grace, is actually having an emergency appendectomy as we speak, and I haven't violated any HIPAA rules by disclosing that. Cindy was okay with me telling you why she couldn't be here.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions]","Thanks again to those of you who are able to join us for our 2000 (sic) Investor Conference in New York on October 30. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and soon-to-be CEO; and as you've already heard, Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the call today is Mike Ellis, Kroger's Senior Vice President and soon-to-be President and Chief Operating Officer.","Our third quarter results were quite strong and helped ensure that 2013 will be another great year. Team Kroger continues to fuel our accelerated growth by performing with consistency and discipline. The resiliency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for shareholders and customers was on full display during the quarter even as our internal research shows that customers remain uncertain about the economy.","We expanded rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We increased return on invested capital while increasing capital investment, and we lowered operating costs as a percent of sales. And once again, this quarter, our associates' disciplined performance resulted in positive identical sales in every operating division and every store department.","Overall, our quarterly results show once again that Kroger is uniquely positioned to grow and win in the U.S. food retail industry.","I am most proud, however, of another distinctive achievement, team Kroger's 40th consecutive quarter of positive identical sales. It is not simply the scorecard that makes this meaningful, although 10 full years without skipping a beat is extraordinary. What makes 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales so remarkable is the underlying importance of the metric.","For retailers, identical sales are the strongest indication of whether or not we are connecting with our customers over time. Every one of our 343,000 associates deserves recognition for their individual work to achieve this unprecedented milestone. Congratulations. I know our entire team is hard at work to achieve the 41st.","We are pleased with where our business is trending, pleased with the growth of our loyal households and pleased with our business during the Halloween and important Thanksgiving holiday, all of which give us confidence that we will achieve our full year earnings per share and identical supermarket sales guidance.","Looking forward to 2014, we expect our earnings per share growth rate to be 8% to 11%, excluding the effect of the Harris Teeter merger and tax benefits, which is consistent with our long-term growth objective. I'll now hand off to Rodney for more details on the third quarter performance and consumer sentiment. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did a terrific job executing our Customer 1st Strategy in the third quarter. We improved our connection with customers, especially our most loyal shoppers and are receiving more credit from our customers because of our strong progress to improve our fresh products and customer service. As you know, these areas are important aspects of our 4 keys.","Before we discuss our loyal customer growth for the quarter, I want to highlight that Kroger has consistently grown loyal households for the last -- the past 10 years. We estimate that since 2003, loyal households have increased by an outstanding 83%. That means today, compared to a decade ago, 83% more households are shopping with greater print [ph], purchasing more items from our stores. Focusing on our most loyal customers has been a real key to reaching 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales.","In the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores because on average, we only capture $0.50 of every $1 loyal customer spend on products we sell. In the third quarter, loyal customers drove total sales gains in line with our strategy.","Our strong identical sales in the quarter were largely driven by the increases in total and loyal households. Total units in the quarter were up compared to last year, although items per trip continues to trend down as it has for the last couple of years. We believe this is a reflection of changes in shopping patterns that began with the economic downturn and have now become the norm. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.5%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","As Dave mentioned earlier, we had positive identical sales in every department. These sales were exceptionally strong in produce and natural foods. These gains confirm that our Customer 1st investments in our products are working as intended and creating sustainable competitive advantages for Kroger.","We continue to invest to meet our customers' health and wellness needs, and this is evident in our pharmacy and the Little Clinic businesses. We are very pleased with the strong gains we've made when our pharmacy team seized the opportunity created by the dispute between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and even more pleased with the scripts that we've retained. By nearly every measure, our pharmacy team took advantage of that opportunity and ran with it. The Little Clinic likewise continues to see strong growth.","Many of our customers are feeling the stress of an economy that is only slowly improving, and they are not immune to the episodic ups and downs that create uncertainty. There are a number of factors impacting an already fragile consumer sentiment, including government gridlock, various concerns about health care, and it remains to be seen how the reduction in SNAP benefits will impact the entire U.S. retail industry. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks.","What little economic recovery there is remains bifurcated. For some of our customers, the economy is markedly improved. But for others, there are no -- there has been no noticeable improvement at all. While these factors are creating more uncertainty than we normally have, we have never been more confident in our business model and we continue to gain market share. This is because of the remarkable consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy. No matter the environment, our customers and shareholders can depend on Kroger to deliver value. Our ability to make constant adjustments based on what we see in the environment and what our customers are facing has defined Kroger, in our customer's eyes, as a place they can rely on in good times and in tough times.","We continue to personalize and merchandise in ways that solve for the needs of all of our customers. For the customer under stress, we are offering low entry price point on key items and special low prices on seasonal items, especially in corporate brands. And for all our customers are -- and all our customers are benefiting from better service and more value through lower prices on organic and natural foods, including Simple Truth, as well as our digital promotions, fuel rewards and health and wellness offerings.","Corporate brands continued to gain market share during the third quarter as well, with corporate brands representing approximately 26.1% of total units sold, and sales dollars were 24.1%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter, as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs are -- costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the adjustment items for 2012 and '13 decreased 27 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. We are on track to deliver our ninth consecutive year of leveraging operating costs.","Before I turn it over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on labor relations. Our store associate ratified new labor agreements covering stores in Little Rock, Dallas and Seattle. We are currently negotiating our contract in Cincinnati, which is on extension until March 1. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.","Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, plus enhance job security for all associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we have added 33,000 jobs.","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.2% to $22.5 billion in the quarter compared to $21.8 billion for the same period last year. We know there are estimates out there that are higher than our total sales, but it's important to keep in mind that the retail price per gallon of fuel was down 8% for the quarter. This is why we look at sales excluding fuel, which increased 4.7% in the third quarter over the same period last year.","Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain adjustments. This year's third quarter includes a net $0.04 per diluted share benefit that is comprised of $0.05 from certain tax items, partially offset by expenses related to Kroger's pending merger with Harris Teeter.","Last year's third quarter included a $0.14 per share benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and from a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January of 2012. Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.53 per diluted share in the third quarter this year and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.","FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.57% of sales in the third quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $15 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. The company continues to estimate its full year LIFO charge at $55 million.","FIFO operating profit margin, excluding fuel, the 53rd week last year and the adjustment items in fiscal 2012 and 2013 on a rolling 4-quarters basis increased 11 basis points. On this basis and for the full year, we can continue to expect our non-fuel FIFO operating margin to expand slightly.","Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About 1\/2 of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers' rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.141 compared to $0.133 a year ago. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.","We increased our return on invested capital on a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, recording a 13.42% return on invested capital this year compared to 13.34% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.","Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating; repurchase shares; have a growing dividend; and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $8.2 billion, a decrease of $525 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, Kroger's net total-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 1.86 compared to 2.08 during the same period last year.","During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 3.6 million common shares for a total investment of $148 million. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has returned more than $752 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends as a result of our strong financial position.","Capital investment, excluding purchases of leased property, totaled $641 million for the third quarter compared to $474 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.8 billion. We expect full year capital investments to be approximately $2.4 billion.","As you know, we plan to continue increasing capital investment over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and ROIC. This fill-in strategy is a continuation of efforts that have been underway for some time and include a new focus on markets such as Dallas, Texas and the state of Michigan.","Stores we have opened in the earlier fill-in markets are producing results in line with our expectations, giving us the confidence to add new fill-in markets. Additionally, we will continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically.","Next, I would like to update you on our pending merger with Harris Teeter. To say we are excited about the prospects of our companies joining together would be an understatement. We know this is going to be an outstanding combination that will benefit our customers, associates and shareholders.","The merger is proceeding as planned. Both Kroger and Harris Teeter are having productive conversations with the FTC staff. We believe we are still on track to close the transaction before the end of Kroger's fiscal 2013.","Now I'll update you on our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Excluding certain tax items and expenses related to our pending merger with Harris Teeter and assuming a LIFO charge consistent with our current estimate, we expect EPS to be up -- for the year, to be up in the range of $2.73 to $2.80. That's our current range. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.","While these are fairly large ranges with one quarter to go, several factors, including the reduced SNAP benefits, a shorter holiday selling season and slow economic recovery, make it a little more difficult to precisely predict the fourth quarter. Regardless of where we finish in the range, it will be a very strong year, demonstrating the strength of our Customer 1st Strategy. I want to echo Dave and Rodney's thanks to all of our associates for your hard work to deliver what will turn out to be a very good year.","We do realize such a wide range of potential earnings per share results this late in the year can be somewhat confusing. It could also raise questions about where our trends are going into next year. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver 2014 results in line with our 8% to 11% earnings per share growth targets. This is why Dave discussed 2014 expectations. Normally we would not talk about this until our year end release in March, but felt it was important to be clear about the underlying confidence we have in our team and the future.","Now I'll turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered strong across-the-board performance in the third quarter. More importantly, we demonstrated the consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for customers and shareholders alike.","Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our investors. As you know, Rodney will become CEO on January 1. While I will continue to serve as Chairman through the end of next year, Rodney will take the lead on the call next quarter.","I've appreciated our dialogue through the years. You have made me a better retailer as we envisioned our future. I hope you will continue to invest in Kroger in the years to come. I know I will. I could not be more confident in Kroger's future, knowing that our entire leadership team and Rodney McMullen will guide Kroger to even higher levels of performance. Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe just the first question to start out. Mike, you talked about the wider range in the fourth quarter. There's not really a wide range around the ID expectation. So is that more around gross margin? And does that say anything about competitive environment and what you're sort of thinking about there? Maybe just a little bit of help on that front.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I don't think it's really -- that it's necessarily an increase in the competitive environment out there. It's always been a competitive industry. I think it's really -- the thing that's a little difficult to read at this point in time is exactly what the effect of the SNAP reduction will be. It's early in that process. While it's been a full month with November behind us, it's a little difficult to extrapolate November. With the Thanksgiving and holiday selling season in that month, it's always a big selling season and people always find ways to have a good holiday celebration. That, coupled with the shorter holiday selling season of between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as just the slow economic recovery, it's just really difficult to predict. As Rodney had mentioned, we see great volatility of sales by day and by week, and it's just a little difficult to predict exactly where we're going to fall in the range. But again, wherever we fall -- wind up falling inside that range for the year on EPS, it's going to be a very solid year and one within our 8% to 11% guidance.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And to the extent the economy -- I mean, you sort of hinted that it's harder, but how do IDs look so far in Q4?","David B. Dillon","Let me answer that, Ed, because I'd like to actually give you a little perspective. I want to look at how they flowed through the third quarter and then bring you up-to-date in the current quarter. In the third quarter, they were stronger earlier in the quarter, a little less strong near the end. However, so far in the fourth quarter, we are running slightly higher than the sales guidance that we've just given. But I want to add, I wouldn't read an awful lot into where we are currently because of the unpredictable nature of the things that Mike just described, the calendar, SNAP benefits and the impact of health care. Uncertainty has -- all of those create uncertainty for the consumer, and as a result, create some unpredictability. So we're optimistic, as you can see. That's why I wanted to give you that perspective on how the sales have emerged so far this quarter.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Is there any way to sort of quantify what you think SNAP has done so far?","W. Rodney McMullen","So far, in November, you can see where SNAP dollars are down, but customers are substituting and buying with cash that shortfall. So the trend so far for that customer hasn't changed, but the way they're paying for their product has changed. How much of that is at the expense of other consumption items would be pure speculation. As you know, the other thing that's helping the economy and everyone is fuel prices are lower this year than a year ago, so some of that savings or benefit or whatever you want to call, is probably coming from there as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. If we take a look at natural and organic foods, you mentioned the strength this quarter. And I guess, we're just hoping if you can provide some additional color on the current size of that business today.","W. Rodney McMullen","How do I do this in a way that is helpful for you, but not gives up competitive advantages? It's a meaningful part of our business. And it would be, I don't know, probably our sixth or seventh largest department. But it's by far the fastest-growing department on a percentage basis, and sometimes even on a dollar basis it's one of the bigger departments. I don't know, Dave or Mike, if you can think of any other way to give a little bit better insight.","David B. Dillon","I think the interesting thing to me is we're such a big company and seeing the growth of that inside our company, you hardly are able to see it the way we do. But it's been a fabulous part of our business. We are pleased. It certainly indicates where customers are headed and have suggested that what we're offering, they really like.","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at our natural -- the competitors out there that focus purely on natural foods, we would be the second-largest retailer out there on a stand-alone basis by a pretty large margin. We would not be bigger than the largest in that space.","Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then I guess, if we could just talk generally about, I mean, how you view the market share opportunity, I mean, maybe taking a brand like Simple Truth, I guess, the mature share or how the share develops over time, do you see the ability to get to, say, double the nonorganic categories of overall market share? And then just lastly, if you could just briefly touch on the margin structure and how did that look compared to the more conventional categories as well?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at the market share opportunities, for us, we can easily see how that business could double from where we are today. And if I understood the question right, you were direct at just Simple Truth, but that comment is, when I look at natural foods and organics overall when I make that comment. But we don't see it as something that's a dream to double our business. We actually have a pretty good plan in place that will get us significantly along the way on getting there in a reasonable period of time. The margins on the business, it's still -- it's a little bit better than the margins on the conventional business, but it's not hugely different. And like in produce, you'll see us more and more pricing a lot of the organic items at the same price as conventional certainly in certain markets. So we're driven because that's where our customer's headed. We think the growth there is because customers overall, our existing customers continue to buy more and more organic and natural foods, plus the younger generation buys a higher share in those categories. So we see a huge opportunity and we see it exciting and we have some great products to offer there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jack Mohr \u2013 Barclays, Research Division.","Jack Mohr \u2013 Barclays, Research Division","This is actually Jack Mohr calling on behalf of Meredith. I guess, I wanted to see what your strategy is more broadly around the new markets that you have recently announced investments in, including the Dallas market, the Michigan and Detroit and then also in Cincinnati. And how would you prioritize the kind of acceleration of investment in those markets? And where do you see the expansion going forward?","W. Rodney McMullen","It's really a combination of several things. It's markets where we see, from a competitive standpoint, an opportunity to gain share because there are certain things that we offer in the market that our competitors may not be offering. We have a good relationship with our associates. And we have a competitive cost structure where we can afford to invest and give the customer a good value and be very strong in the marketplace. So it's a combination of all those things together. It isn't necessarily driven by the economic growth in the market, but we do see, like in Dallas, a great -- that economy there in Dallas\/Fort Worth has a huge growth in front of it.","Jack Mohr \u2013 Barclays, Research Division","And the second question would be, would you consider your strategy to be an aggressive offensive type of strategy in these markets or more of a defensive market share protection? How would you characterize and I guess, maybe more granularly by each of those 3 to 4 new markets that are expanding?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, if you look at the markets you've identified, I feel very comfortable to call all of them offensive. We see great opportunities to get a good return on our investment and grow the business there. So I would characterize as all of them offense in nature. I don't know, if Dave, would you...","David B. Dillon","I not only would characterize it that way, I would even think about it from the point of view of we look at market share more as we can grow our connection with the customer better. I would, and Rodney did the same, is I wouldn't use your term aggressive because that sort of implies you're going to come in and try to stomp on competitors, and that's not the idea. The idea is we attract our customers better, we serve our customers better. That they like what they're having, and that's the relevancy. The customers that we've talked about for so many years. And that's the essence of really of our strategy. So it is definitely offensive and it works exactly like Rodney described.","W. Rodney McMullen","And the other thing is we have a great foundation of associates in these markets. And by -- as you're building new stores, you create a lot of job opportunities for people to get promoted. And what we're finding is we have a lot of associates that are ready to continue to grow to take on more responsibilities. So it's a double win and our shareholders get a good return because we find there's a high correlation between the higher our market share, the higher our return on investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If we're looking at the gasoline business, thanks for the data on that, but as gas prices have come down, what has been the customer response to it? Is it still looking as an important reward? Are they buying more gallons because it's cheaper at a better margin? Can you talk about that a little bit?","David B. Dillon","I'll just mention on gas, as we've said, and Mike or Rodney may want to add to that, but we've said gas is -- fuel is an important part of our business for a variety of reasons. Our gallons were up nicely. We feel -- we continue to feel really good about where we're positioned. But gasoline being a large purchase out of a family's budget, even at these lower prices, is still significant to -- and important to them to have the fuel rewards that we offer. And it's important to have a convenient place to refuel at a really competitive price. I just filled up the last 2 weeks twice at getting $1.05 off a gallon. And I can tell you that even in my case, I smile when I'm driving away from the gas pump. So it makes a difference. Rodney or Mike, do you want to add anything? Okay.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Can you quantify what the gallon lift was in the quarter?","David B. Dillon","Mike, do you want to give any color to that?","J. Michael Schlotman","It was mid-single-digit gallon growth. That's total, not IDs because, as you know, we continue to add a lot of supermarket fuel centers in existing markets that cannibalizes the existing stores a little bit. But it's -- we are very pleased with the direction of the gallons that we're selling in a market that's not growing anywhere near that much.","W. Rodney McMullen","And identicals were positive.","J. Michael Schlotman","Identicals were positive as well.","W. Rodney McMullen","Correct.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. How about the mix of gallons at full price versus the reward price?","David B. Dillon","I don't think we give that out ever, do we?","J. Michael Schlotman","We haven't.","David B. Dillon","And I don't think we're going to start now.","J. Michael Schlotman","The good news is I'm not even tempted to give it to you because I don't know the number off the top of my head.","David B. Dillon","But thank you for asking.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Yes, I try. On the convenience stores, can you give us a little update on how that business is tracking and some of the, call them, experimental formats, you've been looking at, have been trending?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at the core business, that continues to grow and their consecutive identical sales growth quarters is actually longer than the 40 that Kroger has achieved overall, and they continued with their streak. On the experimental formats, I would say right now, we're continuing to learn a lot. And it's still early in the process and Mike Ellis and Chris Hjelm have actually been heading it up, and we've actually recently restructured some of our internal operation structure to get more focus on it. I could tell you we still remain excited about the opportunity, but we haven't found something that I think our shareholders would be excited about the opportunity yet. But we think there's something there and we continue to learn a lot.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Comment on general merchandise sales during the quarter and what that might be telling you about where the customer is headed. And I'm not trying to get in a prediction of holiday sales, but the sort of quarter year-over-year third quarter and how the general merch sales are tracking?","J. Michael Schlotman","One of the important metrics would be, as you look at general merchandise, probably the best metric would be the Fred Meyer Group had an outstanding Black Friday. By the end of that day, they were very pleased with the ID sales growth they had, not important holiday for the general merchandise merchants. And they feel like they're set up very well to have a strong holiday season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","And Dave, congratulations.","David B. Dillon","Thank you.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","We're going to miss you on the calls.","David B. Dillon","Thank you.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","But enjoy your retirement and your grandkids. So I guess, I want to go back to what Ed was focused in on in the first question. Because if I -- and I really appreciate, Mike, you giving us some kind of thought process on the fourth quarter. But I guess what pops into my head is kind of what's changed? In other words, kind of new about SNAP. And I mean, when we were at your Analyst Day, we also -- I think I asked about the days that were going to go missing and we kind of knew about it. So I guess, what I'm trying to understand, it seems like you're a little bit more cautious about the fourth quarter, generally. I just wanted to understand what's kind of maybe changed in your -- even though your sales are running, I guess, over 3.5% right now. So what's changed?","David B. Dillon","Let me add a comment or 2 and then Mike can add to that, Scott. The thing I think I want to emphasize is that we see the world as a little more unpredictable than it generally is. And the SNAP change that occurred, certainly, we knew at the investor conference what was going to happen but we didn't know what the outcome would be and we still don't actually know the outcome, and that's what makes it unpredictable. And the more we think about it, we think it's -- there's a lot of ways in which it could be played out. We still believe, as we did in the investor conference, that customers' eating is a high priority, and so customers will tend to substitute other forms. So they'll pay in cash or credit card if they didn't have the food stamps and then they will give up on something else. And at the moment, as I think Rodney mentioned, they've been able to give up on fuel because the price of fuel is so low. But you don't know where that will lie in the longer term and we also don't know how the Christmas holiday plays out. The holiday calendar, of course, we knew that before, too. Now that it's right upon us and we're reflecting on it, we're not quite sure what it means. And then we watch every day the amount of uncertainty that our customers have generally, not just with SNAP and not just with holiday, but you look at the health care and some of those areas that we've discussed. It just created enough unpredictability for us that we felt we needed to take a little more cautious position.","J. Michael Schlotman","Okay.","David B. Dillon","Okay. Now, Mike doesn't want to add anything more to that. So I think that's the only reason we felt that way. I don't want you to over-interpret what we've said because I'm actually quite optimistic.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","Dave, I appreciate that. Is it something that -- because like you said, your business is running pretty strong right now. Is it behavior inside your stores where the week-to-week and what the consumer is buying? Or is it more of even though you guys are taking maybe even more share now, what's going on with some of your competitors...","David B. Dillon","It's actually that when you look at the data, it's a little, it's more unpredictable, more variable than what we're used to. We've talked about this actually for quarters, where we've seen wider swings from week-to-week, especially first of the month and last of the month kind of swings. We've talked a lot about that. But we're even seeing now, in addition to the week-to-week, the daily kind of swings that are surprising. But still in the end, as you can see in the third quarter, in the end, it came out terrific. So maybe I'm over-reading it, but I just think that variability creates unpredictability, and unpredictability means we need to be a little bit more cautious.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","That's terrific. And then if I could ask one about gross margins and kind of what your thought process vis-a-vis inflation, so I guess, kind of a 2-part question. I think you guys said about 1.5%. Where do you think that's going? And do you think we've had deflation before and people freak out thinking that something is wrong and tend to overinvest in price on top of it? Is that a concern and where do you think the inflation is going? And then I'll yield.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, you bet, Scott. Thanks. From an inflation standpoint, when you look at where -- let's just talk about the grocery categories since that's just such a big percentage of our sales. It's fairly remarkably consistent in the first, second and third quarter, all a little bit above 1% inflation. You look at individual periods inside there, and there's a little bit of variability, but it's been fairly consistent inflation in that grocery category. Some of the perishable categories have had a little bit more inflation during the year, causing that overall index to be a little bit higher. We really haven't experienced deflation and aren't predicting a deflationary environment for next year. Our expectation as we end this year and go into next year is probably inflationary pressure is about the same where we are today, a very low inflationary kind of period, which is a period we operated in for a very long period of time. There was a very long period of time until the last 3 or 4 years where there is virtually no inflation, and in some of those years actually had deflation. So we're comfortable with our ability to continue to execute and operate in this environment. One of the things that does cause us frustration when you see problems with inflation is when there's big variability in an inflation from inside every year from high inflation to deflation and swinging back. Those have been the periods of time where it's been difficult to manage through. But a consistent, little more than 1% in grocery. Yes, life's a little better with a little more. But when it's consistent, it's significantly easier to operate in that inconsistent environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Wanted to get into a little bit what categories are working because it seems like if you look at Nielsen data and some of the other areas out there, the center of the store seems weak for the rest of the industry, yet you're saying all of your categories were still showing good IDs. So maybe if you could tell us color on the center of store versus the perimeter?","David B. Dillon","Well, Rodney may want to add some color to this, but we've identified some of the strong growth areas that we have better than our average sales, places like produce, natural food. I don't think we've mentioned. Well, we did mention pharmacy. It's also true in deli and seafood. But -- and natural food has a number of items that are within the center of the store so that would be partially part of your answer. We're also seeing a really strong or improved trends anyway and very strong in some, but the categories that are more discretionary, which illustrates the bifurcated nature of the economic recovery, things like Starbucks and sushi and Boar's Head and some of the upscale cheese. Greeting cards are doing reasonably well and toys are too, both of which are in the center of the store. And Rodney, you may want to add some more color to where you see that.","W. Rodney McMullen","No, I would agree. If you look at -- it's kind of hard how you define center store anymore. Dave's comment about natural foods is one where I always struggle with because technically, it probably is center of store. That would be -- the center store is the weaker part of our business, but it has been for a long period of time because people are buying more and more -- they want dinner prepared and they just come in and pick something up. So there's all kinds of shifts going on, but we continue to gain good share in what business is there. And it really is just moving -- adapting as the market changes. And Mike reminded me that grocery units continue to grow, so it's still positive. Don't take too much into what I said.","David B. Dillon","Yes, and the important note is that we sell both.","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, it's really important to be positioned to take advantage of both because it's left up to the customer what they want versus us trying to force them.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And if you dig in a little bit on that natural food category, are you still adding aisle space and SKUs to that area or is it really just more higher turns of existing products?","W. Rodney McMullen","It's a good question and it's really both. We continue to -- there's a lot of product innovation in those areas, so you find a lot of good new products that you can add that customers like. We continue to find subcategories within it that we haven't had in the past that's doing very well that we continue to add. Plus if you look at the base business, it just continues to grow. So you have all those things happening. We are continuing to add space to those, to that department when you look across the company.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And are those more focused on your upscale stores or is this actually creeping more into some of the core stores also?","W. Rodney McMullen","This would be all stores. The amount of it would be different. But a value store would have changes as well. It isn't focused just on upscale by no means.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Dave, I just want to add my congratulations on everything you've achieved in the last 10 years or so at Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups. First, at the end of the quarter, when things got weak, could you tie that or would you tie that to using focus groups or your own intuition or whatever, to the uncertainty around the government shutdown? Do you think that was the primary reason October sort of softened for your business?","David B. Dillon","Well, my intuition says it was a variety of things. There was a modest change in the calendar in such a way that, that might have affected it a little bit. I think that there was some differences in our own merchandising from last year to this year, not a lot, but enough that you could maybe see a little difference in it. And then third is the point you raised is I think there were a lot of unpredictable things going on and causing people to be uncertain. I know for sure that in some retailers, you could see a clear change in sales performance when the government was shut down because of the wildly uncertain market that created for some people. And the categories that were within that retailer would have been within our store, and we didn't see quite [indiscernible] and we certainly didn't see that kind of a variation in our total sales or even any one department. But I think each of those things go together, conspire together to create what I think is probably going to be an anomaly. But it illustrated to me how unpredictable some of these events may be. And that's probably what makes me a little cautious. It doesn't make me negative, it makes me cautious about predicting, not cautious about what the future will actually be. That's why I emphasized I'm actually quite optimistic.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, I think that's a good segue into my real -- my primary question, which is around the sort of ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the kind of machinations it's changing and as it's going -- the rules that are coming out and all that's going on. So we've had our conference recently. It seems to be, especially from the corporate viewpoints, creating a lot of consternation about the consumer, about take-home checks, are those going to change January 1 materially, and really about corporate cost structure. So sure you guys have put a lot of time and energy into this. I know there's a lot of uncertainty around it. But I wonder if you could just share with us right now and I know this will change over time kind of your best thinking around the consumer, what it's going to mean for the consumer and what it could mean for Kroger's cost structure. Maybe it's a positive thing relative to nonunion businesses, but I'd just like to hear what you think about that.","David B. Dillon","Well, I have a couple of thoughts and recognizing it's early and as you point out, it makes things a little hard to know for sure. But the first thing is that everyone will be affected in a similar kind of a way. I don't think Kroger will be singled out in any particular way either in advantage or disadvantage. And as a result, if it ends up being worse than I'm mentally thinking, then it's worse for everybody than it is -- it's just not Kroger. But also what we're seeing early on so far is our estimates and the way we've played out the future is consistent with what we have been thinking and what we've been feeling, meaning our cost will go up a little bit, it's going to be manageable, it's within the context of what we see as our long-term earnings guidance. And it doesn't change our confidence level at all about what our future looks like and our ability to perform. The short-term effect, the effect on uncertainty and unpredictability for the customer and whether that changes their behavior, that actually could be a short-term issue, it certainly could be a long-term issue too, if I'm wrong. But the short-term issue is more because of the unpredictable nature, does that cause the customer to be more cautious themselves and their behavior. That's what many people felt happened with the government shutdown. And then, of course, once that got back to normal, then a lot of the business looks like it kind of recovered and came back to normal, too. Rodney, I don't know. You and I have talked a little bit about that. You want to add any...","W. Rodney McMullen","No. No, there are some customers that will probably end up saving money as well. If you were in one of the groups where you were paying more for premiums than under the new structure, so there's some people that's on the other side of that as well. So I think Dave's point on unpredictable in terms of how the customers are going to react, I think the customer doesn't even know how they're going to react yet, because they're still trying to understand what does it mean.","David B. Dillon","Yes. Now, you did mention the union, nonunion picture and of course, we have a number of collective bargaining agreements. And in those, it does create a little, I want to say a little bigger pressure on both parties, on the union bargainers and on the company bargainers, because there's certain changes you have to make because of the law. And when you make those, then that has cost implications and then that puts pressure on the rest of the contract to make whatever other changes you have to make to adjust for that. And I could see the argument that might put a union operator at a competitive disadvantage. I don't happen to feel that way but I can certainly see the argument. Because I think what it really does is it causes the parties at the bargaining table to try to face reality and say, \"How are we going to collectively negotiate this out and compromise this out in a way that works for the law and works for our associates and works for the company?\" And that's been our objective and so far, we've been pleased with being able to do that.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I just want to get one follow-up on a question a few folks, including Mark Wiltamuth, I think asked on where the natural food growth is coming, velocity versus expansion. And really, Rodney, I think you said the business could double and I clearly see that that's more than likely. But would you -- could you put a time frame around that, bracket it? Would it be closer to 10 years, closer to 5 years, within which you predict, I know not to the year, but what -- would it be closer to one or the other?","W. Rodney McMullen","I would say it's closer to 5. Now Mike Ellis is over there cringing because if you -- I would be pushing him to maybe get there a little faster.","Michael L. Ellis","True.","W. Rodney McMullen","But definitely, I would see it in the next 5 years' time frame.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division",";","I just wanted to ask a couple more housekeeping-related questions. On your comp this quarter and also on your gross margin, what was the impact of generics this quarter? Have we finally cycled that completely or are there still some impact on the comps?","J. Michael Schlotman","With and without pharmacy numbers, without pharmacy, we were a little bit stronger without it when you take pharmacy out of our sales along with fuel so there was still a slight impact on the ID sales as a result of the pharmacy department. It wasn't [indiscernible] certainly declining.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So it should be fully cycled by '14?","J. Michael Schlotman","It's not meaningful. It's not meaningful anymore, it's so small.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the gross margin deterioration that we saw this quarter, now that we've more or less cycled the generic benefit on the gross, is that kind of -- is that our I should think about the gross margin deterioration this quarter? Like it was obviously less in the first and second and then now it's just taking a little bit of a step up, not that meaningful, but it's [indiscernible]","J. Michael Schlotman","I would characterize where our gross wound up a little different than deterioration when you look at the cost savings, the total operating cost savings that Rodney spoke of when we look at OG&A plus rent and depreciation, we clearly paid for our investments in gross. And we continue to strive the balance on our rolling 4-quarters basis, the investments we make in gross and the reductions in our cost. And as we've always said, individual quarters can have different results than the full year happens to have. And I wouldn't take one quarter and try to extrapolate that. I would look more where we've been on a rolling 4-quarters basis or on an annual basis so far this year.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then looking at your CapEx, you brought your CapEx spend up to the high -- well, to the high end of the range, but it seems like the projects that you have, have kind of remained unchanged. Anything to point to there because it was $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, just that we -- where we sit today, having spent $1.8 billion year-to-date, it's more likely than not that we're going to be in that $2.4 billion range. When you look at the number of projects, the major projects may not be appreciably different as a result of that. We're doing a lot of smaller remodels that don't fall into the major project category. Plus we're having a lot of spending in 2013 on 2014 projects, so we can get them opened earlier in the year. And that is something we continually work on, is to not look at those budgets necessarily that you budgeted to open in '14. So spend all your dollars in '14. So there is quite a bit of pre-spend on 2014 openings.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question is when you actually close on Harris Teeter, will you provide updated guidance at that time or are you going to wait until you report your fourth quarter?","J. Michael Schlotman","My view is that considering that it will be by the end of our fiscal year, which means by the end of January, we'll probably take February to sit down with them. It's a little difficult today to have even conversations with them about what their business plans should look like next year relative to the FTC will be concerned. We're trying to run their business and we haven't closed on the merger. So my expectation is we'll take the month of February to sit down with the management team at Harris Teeter to solidify jointly what their business plan should look like for 2014 and then give combined guidance when we release earnings for the full year in March.","W. Rodney McMullen","But the accretion for the first full year would be consistent with what we talked about before.","J. Michael Schlotman","Absolutely, there's nothing that we know of or would expect to know of that would cause the $0.06 to $0.09 to be different.","David B. Dillon","Yes, great, Karen. Thank you very much. And before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional brief thoughts with our associates, who we encourage to listen. 10 years of positive identical sales growth is simply amazing, and I'm proud to be a part of an organization that is committed to serving our customers and enriching the lives of others. As I've said earlier, each of us had a role to play in reaching this milestone. It is one you should each be proud of. And thank you all for what you do to make our stores the best place in which to shop during the holidays. Remember the little things like a smile and a friendly greeting always make a customer's day better. And actually, they make our day better, too. I hope each of you celebrate the holidays with family and friends. We wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. That completes the call today.

With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","Restock Kroger is designed to reposition our core business by 2020, so we can achieve our long-term vision to serve America through Food and Inspiration and Uplift. We outlined the four main drivers of our plan last October. First, redefine the grocery customer experience. Second, partner for customer value. Third, develop talent; and fourth, live our purpose. Delivering on our objectives under each of these areas between now and 2020, will generate incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow to create shareholder value. And while we are only two quarters into our three-year plan, we are making solid progress. ","More importantly, I want to help you understand how all the steps we take today and in the future are set in motion with clear strategic intent in line with our vision. Everything we are doing is intended to create a truly seamless shopping experience, so we can serve customers anything, anytime, and anywhere. As we create a seamless experience, we will use our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers to be the hero to their families at meal time, every time. ","You can see this through our exclusive arrangement to bring Ocado\u2019s smart platform to the US, and in our recent launch of Ship. Kroger's new direct-to-customer shipping platform and in our continued expansion in home delivery, including our driver less delivery test with Nuro. You can also see this in our merger with Home Chef, part of what makes our merger so exciting is their data-driven and customer-centered approach to menu creation and meal solution development. Home Chef is accelerating our ability to deliver convenience, simplicity and a personalized food experience.","We are also building an expansive network of innovative partnerships to create new customer value. Alternative revenue streams will expand and enhance our strong core business and increase profitability. Partnering with innovators like Ocado will both accelerate our core business and serve as the foundational platforms for new opportunities. Our decision to launch our brands in the international markets through Alibaba's Tmall global platform is another example of our willingness to develop alternative revenue streams. And our people, generosity, and passion for Zero Hunger Zero Waste will make the world a better place.","We are incredibly excited to see that our Zero Hunger Zero Waste commitment earned Kroger a place among the top companies on Fortune Magazine's Change the World List. You can see our vision coming into focus in several of the exciting announcements we've made over the last couple of months, and we're obviously not done. As we share more of these very intentional puzzle pieces with you in the months and years ahead, a very clear picture will emerge. Every one of these announcements is both the culmination of a new beginning, and they are a culmination of the long focused strategic work by our teams, and they are the new beginning of the exciting innovations and growth platforms for the future.","Kroger's digital sales grew by over 50% in the second quarter. We are executing our digital strategy in growing our seamless coverage area which now reaches more than 80% of our customers, up from 75% in the first quarter. This includes our network of ClickList pickup locations, stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners, and ship to home capabilities such as our new Kroger Ship platform. Kroger Ship launched in four markets in August. Cincinnati, Houston, Louisville, and Nashville. We have since launched in Atlanta and anticipate rolling out the service to additional markets over the next few months.","During this first phase of Ship, customers can shop from a curated selection of over 4,500 of our brand products, which are not available anywhere else online, and more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter most to our customers. A list informed by the 8451 [ph] data and insights. Executing our strategy and innovating our core business requires tremendous digital and technology talent. I'm pleased to share that this summer, Kroger Technology was named one of the best places to work in IT by Computerworld Magazine. ","Also this summer, we announced Kroger is establishing a new digital headquarter in downtown Cincinnati. In the city alone, we expect to grow the digital team from about 600 today to over 1,000 people by 2020. Then in August, we signed an agreement with the University of Cincinnati to operate an Innovation Lab within the school's new innovation hub creating another talent pipeline to support our business. All the changes we are making to build digital platforms will also create opportunities to grow our business and improve margins in the future.","We are aggressively investing in these transformational opportunities, and while we are investing for the future, we are delivering for customers and shareholders today. Our Brands continue to resonate with customers both in-store and online. Since August launch of Kroger Ship, 41 of the top 50 items sold are our brands, and 4 of the top 5 items on ClickList are Our Brands. In the center of the store, premium Our Brands including Private Selection, HemisFares, and Abound grew double digits during the second quarter as well. In the second quarter, Our Brands made up 28.2% of unit sales and 26.5% of sales dollars, both of which are record results for our second quarter.","Our Brands continue to outpace Kroger's identical sales growth led by more than a 15% growth in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines during the second quarter. Simple Truth has quickly become the second largest brand sold in our stores since launching five years ago. In 2018, Simple Truth reached more than $2 billion in annual sales, making it the largest natural and organic brand in America. Simple Truth's popularity and explosive growth is a major reason why we're starting with the brand in our first international pilot with Alibaba's Group Tmall Global platform.","Restock Kroger is just getting started. We like what we're seeing so far, and we're working to keep that trend going. The outcome of our key Restock Kroger drivers is a creation of shareholder value, which we remain committed to delivering over the long term. In June, we announced that Kroger's board approved a dividend increase for the 12the consecutive year. Our dividend has grown at a double-digit compound annual growth rate since it was reinstated in 2006.","We continue to expect an increasing dividend over time. We are on track to generate the free cash flow and the incremental FIFO operating profit that we committed to in Restock Kroger through 2020, and to deliver on our long-term vision to serve America through Food Inspiration and Uplift.","Now here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to update you and our guidance for the remainder of 2018. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders, while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. As noted in our press release this morning, for the first half of 2018, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result was slightly ahead of our internal expectations due to the solid early execution of Restock Kroger, including process changes that led the sustainable cost controls, and higher margin alternative revenue streams. This performance will allow us to continue making incremental investments, while delivering on our guidance range for the year. We also noted that the second quarter adjustment items relate primarily to the change in the market value of Kroger's investment in Ocado securities. Since our investment and partnership announcement in the second quarter, the share price has doubled.","As you know, we accelerated several planned Restock Kroger investments starting in the first quarter and continuing during the second quarter These include investments in price especially in support of Our Brands and in space optimization. Our pricing strategy isn't new. Since 2000, we have invested more than $4.2 billion in lower prices for customers, while also striving to provide the best full-service grocery experience in America. Even as we pursue our long-term strategy, we always look for ways to bank savings before we make significant investments as we did in the first half of the year.","We noted in June that pull forward investments in Restock Kroger that began in the last four weeks of the quarter, and continued space optimization roll out would be headwinds to ID sales in the second quarter. So this effect is not a surprise to us. We expect the headwinds from space optimization during the first half of 2018 to become a tailwind late in the third quarter. Looking at our ID sales in the second quarter, 20 of our supermarket divisions had positive IDs, demonstrating Restock Kroger is resonating with customers across the company.","Several departments outperformed our total ID sales in the second quarter, most notably natural foods, seafood and pharmacy. We also continued to see growth in households during the quarter. Looking at gross margin, we were pleased to see that shrink rate continue to improve during the second quarter. The gross margin rate reflects the company's price investments, some rising transportation costs, and the growth for the specialty pharmacy business. Part of our price investments was to support Our Brands especially to reduce starting price points. The improvement-- new movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers.","We intend to continue to invest in price to drive unit growth, while also delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. OG&A cost increased as a rate of sales driven entirely by higher expense for incentive plans as compared to last year. We continue to face raising credit card fees especially as more customer shift to using credit cards with higher interchange rates. This is a growing problem and we are taking steps to address it. You likely saw the news this summer that our Foods Co. supermarket division announced that it would no longer accept visa credit cards as a form of payments.","This is because visa rates and fees are among the highest of any credit card brand. We stopped accepting Visa credit cards to save on the high costs associated with credit card companies interchange rates and network fees. The savings will be passed along to Foods Co. customers in the form of every day low prices on items shoppers purchased the most. Foods Co. stopped accepting the cards in mid-august and we are currently assessing our next steps. We're prepared to expand not acceptance to other banners if that's what it takes to get a level playing field for negotiated interchange rates. It's also worth noting that we recently changed our Kroger rewards credit card from visa to MasterCard.","We will continue to aggressively manage OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods. A big focus continues to be on the store productivity and waste. We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in Restock Kroger and redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of good savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is how we will generate $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020. ","Now for an update on a retail fuel performance store in the second quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.263 compared to $0.217 in last year second quarter. Average retail price of fuel was $2.85 versus $2.28 in the same quarter last year. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%. Excluding the 2018 first and second quarter adjustment items, we expect the 2018 rate to be approximately 20%. Favorable tax resolutions with certain states during the quarter benefited adjusted second quarter net earnings by about $0.01 per diluted share.","As previously announced, we are actively exploring strategic alternatives for our Turkey Hill Dairy business, including a potential sale. We want to ensure Turkey Hill has every opportunity to meet its full growth potential. Turkey Hill's unique CPG food business within Kroger as it is a strong nationally known brand. Much like our convenience store business, Turkey Hill is such a beloved brand thanks to the 800 dedicated associates who would contribute to its success. We remain committed to generating to $6.5 billion of free cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger. The original amount was $6 billion and we increased it to $6.5 billion after the passage of the Federal Tax Act.","We expect the Tax Act to reduce cash taxes by about $1.2 billion over the next three years. We used $700 million of those savings to fund our investment in Ocado and our merger with Home Chef. On one other note to this is we have working capital improvements built into the guidance, and we're off to a great start with a $300 million improvement in that operating capital so far this year. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.59 Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.33 to 2.4. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect our leverage ratio to remain slightly above the target range, primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the company's merger with Home Chef and investments in Ocado.","Kroger remains committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range. Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth, while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last four quarters, we've used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion pretax to the company sponsored pension plans, and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdraw obligations to the Central States pension fund. We repurchased 103 million common shares for $2.6 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business unit under a previously announced accelerated stock repurchase plan.","We paid $435 million in dividends and invested $2.9 billion in capital. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization. We're investing an incremental $500 million in our associates, in wages, training and development over the next three years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits, while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and trainings.","In March, we also announced investing in a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program Feed Your Future and an increased 401-k match for our non-union associates. We recently ratified a contract with the UFCW covering Kroger associates in Fort Wayne and enrichment in Hampton Roads areas. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW contracts for stores covering associates at Smith's in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.","We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant for today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to guidance for 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth excluding fuel to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. We updated our GAAP net earnings guidance range to $3.88 to $4.03 per diluted share for 2018 from the previous range of $3.64 to $3.79. This increase in guidance is due to the unrealized gain and Ocado shares recorded in the second quarter and do not reflect any ongoing changes in the market value of Ocado shares because those cannot be predicted. ","On an adjusted basis, our net earnings guidance range remains $2 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be approximately $3 billion through 2018. ","And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. Everything we are doing supports are Restock Kroger vision to serve America through Food Inspiration and Uplift. And we are executing our strategy. We are building a truly seamless shopping experience, so we can serve customers anything, anytime, and anywhere. We're using our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers be a hero to their families at Meal Time every time.","We are identifying partners who will help us deliver customer value today and the future. We are laying a foundation for more profitable alternative revenue streams that will also accelerate core business growth, and we are serious about living our purpose to Feed the Human Spirit because associates, customers and stakeholders are increasingly deciding where to work, where to shop, where to invest and who to support based on a company's commitment to making the world a better place. It's no surprise then that we are very proud of Kroger was recognized in Fortune Magazine's 2018 Changed the World list for Zero Hunger And Zero Waste.","Our plan to end hunger in places we call home and eliminate waste across our company by 2025. It is exciting to see our vision taking shape especially because we know that the delivering on our vision will create value for our customers, associates and shareholders.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Kelly","Hi, guys. Good morning. Well, I wanted to start with the IDs. Can you talk about the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter? What you're seeing so far in the third quarter, and then part of this, can you quantify the impact that optimization had on the IDs during the quarter and just generally how is that playing out so far relative to what you've expected?","Rodney McMullen","I'll start out, and I'll let Mike fill in. If you look at the space optimization and the other projects that we mentioned, without those, our identicals would have been a little over 2%. If you look at so far in the third quarter, we're trending a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. Michael, I'll let you talk about the cadence during the quarter.","Mike Schlotman","I think the cadence was actually fairly consistent. There -- actually there was a blip or two when you look at some things like in Texas last year, when we had the disruption down there from Hurricane Harvey, and those kind of comparisons to the prior year make things a little bit difficult to compare, but when you factor out some of those kinds of items, it was actually fairly consistent. I think the encouraging thing is when Rodney talks about where we would have been and why we are very comfortable continuing to give guidance for the year of 2% to 2.5%. What we're seeing on the space optimization stores when they come out of the period of disruption, and they get back to business as usual.","We're seeing exactly what we expect to see, and obviously as we get to the back half of the year with the holiday selling season, we won't have stores disrupted, and we'll have the stores-- we're going to realign completed, so we expect to have a great fleet of stores going into the important holiday selling season in the fourth quarter, and 600 of those redone in a way that is resonating with the customers.","Edward Kelly","Great, thank you. And just as a follow-up on the guidance, from an EPS standpoint, it does seem like so far this year things have been a bit better than what you've expected, and you just talked about that. I think Mike that you raised guidance or you lowered the guidance for your tax rate, if you could just clarify that? But either way, this quarter you didn't touch the guidance at all from an EPS standpoint. Is there something out there that incrementally you're concerned about or is this simply a case of conservatism and as you're comfortable around the guidance you are really thinking about investing in the business for the next couple of years?","Mike Schlotman","Yes. When you look at the tax rate, obviously, we had the benefit of the favorable tax resolution from a state standpoint in the first quarter. With and without the C stores effects, the tax rate a bit as well, so it's a little bit confusing. So, I know it is a little bit lower, but I would remind you that we lowered -- we raised the low end of our guidance range in the first quarter, and all of those kinds of things would have factored into our decision to do that including at what the time once the C store transaction closed and the like and where we were on state tax issues knowing things that we weren't going to say publicly yet, all factored into that decision to raise the lower end. Relative to what we do with over performance, I think you know as well as anybody Ed, and we have a very long history as I indicated in the prepared comments. We like to deliver some results before we make all the investments that we plan to make. We, obviously, this year is a little different in that we had the Tax Act savings to invest and pull some pricing moves forward, while still being able to deliver on our earnings per share growth.","And I think you will see us probably decide how we manage through the rest of the year, and where we think the dollars are going to be, continue to make investments to grow the business for the long term. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance range today, that's a little over 6% earnings per share growth rate, which I think is a very respectable result in an environment where we're making dramatic investments to reshape the future of the company.","I think the management team here at Kroger is proud of being able to refocus our future efforts, and still deliver on the bottom line for shareholders.","Rodney McMullen","And Mike, the last point there, I think it's important to remind everybody that we aggressively continue to invest in our digital businesses, and connecting with that customer will increasingly be important in the future obviously because what we find is when a customer engages with us in all channels, they spend more money with us.","Mike Schlotman","Growing 50% in the digital business doesn't happen without those investments and focus.","Operator","The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Judah Frommer","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. So maybe first just to follow up on the guidance point, I think there's a little confusion because like it said, the EPS range didn't change. The tax rate came down, so is there some implication that operating income could be lower than you anticipated in the back half of the year or is the range just wide enough that there's a range of outcomes considered in the guidance?","Mike Schlotman","I think it's your latter point. We\u2019ve guided all along when we gave original guidance and even back last October when we discussed Restock Kroger with everybody that we expected 2018 to be a year of investment, and that we would expect operating profit margin to be down. We also talked about the fact in March that once the Tax Act got passed, we were going to take some of those savings, about a third of them would fall to the bottom line, which you have seen through the lower tax rate over time. About a third of it would be invested back in the business, meaning some price investments that we pulled forward into this year out of future years.","So these are planned investments that we did early, which means that was a conscious decision to lower operating profit a little more than our original plan this year. I think we were as clear as we could be about that and in March as compared to where we would have been in October. And then the third leg of that stool is the investment in people that we talked about with the Feed Your Future where part-time and full-time associates if you've worked with us for at least six months can get $3,500 a year to continue their education or get a GED or get a specific trade certification as well as the increased 401-k match for our associates.","I think when you balance all of that, the fact that we're going through, everything we're going through making the investments to space optimization work, incremental benefits for a lot of our associates. and that $3,500 is also associates that store associates and office associates alike. I think that I'm very happy with how we're managing through this significant year of change, and still at the midpoint delivering what would be expected to be a 6% earnings per share growth rate or so at the midpoint of our current estimate.","Judah Frommer","Okay, got it. And just to follow up maybe on the gross margin, the investment a little bit bigger ex fuel than we anticipated, but can you break down for us a little bit investment in price relative to the freight pressure and how much of the price investment is related to competition that you're seeing from other channels versus an internal plan? And was there anything above and beyond what you anticipated investing because it was such a strong fuel quarter?","Mike Schlotman","I think we're right on track with what we expect to invest in price and the pull forward investments we wound up making. One of the comments we made in both the press release and the prepared remarks was the growth of our Kroger specialty pharmacy business. Their growth has been quite impressive and their ability to gain new relationships in that world has been quite impressive. That is a very high sales model, a very low gross margin compared to the overall Kroger gross margin. So that mix as it grows pulls our gross margin down, but it drives very nice growth and gross margin in that business because of what those pharmaceuticals wind up costing.","So when you mix all that out, I don't think we did anything out of the ordinary from our price investments. It's just what --it's just what's out there. And I would be remiss and talking about gross profit, if I didn't give a shout out to our cost and waste team and a very continued. I think it's four quarters in a row now where we've had improvements in our shrink rate. And with our sales when you have some very nice improvements in the shrink rate, that's one of the cost savings we expect to help fuel Restock Kroger, and they are delivering on what our expectations are. So we have that fuel for the engine. ","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Erica Eiler","Good morning. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks a lot for taking our questions. so I wanted to touch on guidance here as well. I was hoping maybe you could talk about what gives you continued confidence on delivering on the 2% and 2.5% ID sales growth, given it implies a meaningful acceleration even with more difficult comparison. You talked a little bit about Kroger Restock and the benefits you're expecting to see there in the back half, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about that's going to drive that acceleration here.","Mike Schlotman","Well, I think when we look at it and decide to keep the 2% and 2.5%, it's something that we certainly think is achievable, and I said on when I was on Bloomberg and CNBC this morning, we're laser focused on delivering on those results. And when you think about Rodney's comment that without the headwind of price investments that we made late in the first quarter that really affected the second quarter pretty dramatically as well. Space optimization without the effect of those headwinds in the second quarter we would have been over 2%.","And as the price investments are in for a longer period of time, the effect as a headwind diminishes because the unit's start to pick up like I spoke up in the prepared comments with the pickup in units and Our Brands where we've made some price investments. And the --we are more than halfway through our space optimization work about 55% of the stores that we would expect that. We completed -- are behind us, so as those stores start to mature and come out of the cycle of disruption, they will feed the ID sales as we get later this quarter and into the fourth quarter.","So it's the combination of those that we expect to come together and be able to deliver in the 2% to 2.5% range. ","Erica Eiler","Okay, great, that's helpful. And then just hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about inflation deflation here. What you saw during the quarter? Your latest outlook, and are you starting to see price increases come through from your vendors? And are you starting to see shelf prices move up? Any additional color here would be helpful as well.","Rodney McMullen","I'll let Mike fill in some of the details, but if you look at overall, really, it was basically zero on inflation deflation. You have some of the fresh departments that had a little bit of deflation, but there wasn't anything substantial. So looking forward, we really don't see much change. I would say at this point, we --obviously there's been several announced increases, but we've seen very limited number of increases so far. And the customer certainly wouldn't be experiencing any increase either in terms of the prices they're paying. And in fact, it's a little bit less than a year ago. So Mike, I'll let fill in some of the details.","Mike Schlotman","And I would agree with you on. It's flat overall and there are pluses and minuses in all the different categories, and our LIFO estimate for the year would be substantially if not entirely driven by where our pharmacy inflation is in the amount of pharmacy business, and an inventory we have to support that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Sorry just on that last question just to clarify, on cost inflation versus retail inflation, you're saying both are basically flat or could you just clarify that?","Mike Schlotman","We were referring to, at least I was referring to and I believe Rodney was referring to cost inflation is what we were talking about. We're not going to get into retail inflation because it's pretty difficult to calculate as we continue to make price investments as well as see the investments we make in our brands and the growth of Our Brands. It can look like retail deflation, but a lot of times it's just growth in the lower price point item, but a higher margin item on the shelf causing that.","So we stay focused on where costs are going and deciding how to react to that at retail.","Karen Short","Okay and I know on the last earnings call you indicated that you might be willing to give some more concrete data on what kinds of sales lists you're seeing in the optimized stores? Are you willing to do that today? Can you just give a little more color?","Mike Schlotman","Well, I think when you think about what we reported in the second quarter of 1.6 IDs. And if you were to factor out the headwind that's out there for space optimization and the price investments late in the first quarter that we would have been over 2%. I think you see one that the headwind of that as well as what the potential tailwind that's out there. I won't get into specifics of exactly what those are generating, but as we see them --as we see those stores coming out and what they generate and knowing that we're more than halfway through what we want to get done, we're looking forward to that turning into a tailwind late this quarter.","Karen Short","Okay and then I guess I just wanted to switch gears to the IDs a little bit and look at the spread between the new definition and the old definition. Obviously, you gave us the historical spread. I mean from last year in the net 8-K, so obviously that spreads widening and I guess what I want to ask is it seems fair to think that spread will continue to pretty meaningfully widen as we go forward given the strong growth in digital. Is that fair to think about it because I mean I think at the end of the day people still want to cut some sense of where your IDs are excluding the digital component.","Mike Schlotman","Well, I spoke of the fact that we had broad-based ID sales growth in our operating divisions with 20 of them having positive ID sales. And that would have been on the traditional calculation. That would include ClickList because they are fulfilled at the store level and would have always been in there. So we're happy, very happy with the trends we are seeing. Obviously, that's disrupted by the space optimization, space optimization and the price investments at the store level don't really affect things like shift and Kroger Specialty pharmacy.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. Karen, on your question as you look forward, we would certainly expect the gap increase over time. It's becoming increasingly difficult when a customer engages with us and they engage with us on Ship, they engage with us on Vitacost and some of the other parts of our business. When they engage multiple places, we get a bigger share of their total and our total sales grow, but in terms of historically the way we would keep track of that it does change the mix and where --how the customers engaging with us, which is the reason why we changed the definition. But we would expect that gap to continue to increase as we've become more multi-dimensional.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris Mandeville","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I'm still a little bit uncertain surrounding the back half guidance here. Mike, just to be clear on the tax rate, you're implying that we're looking for an 18% tax rate in the back half. Is that correct? And the street expectations at the very least on EBIT it's going to have come down quite considerably, so just trying to get some incremental color on what's driving that versus what we were initially expecting back in March. Is it more on the gross margin line? Is it more OpEx? Just any color would be helpful there.","Mike Schlotman","I mean when you look at --when you look at the back half, I don't think we're that low on a tax rate. When you look at the 20% for the year or so will probably be above that in the third quarter, maybe below that in the fourth quarter because we - we do try to factor in when we might see things like the tax settlement that happened in the second quarter with three different states. There are things out there like that to wind up happening as well.","I'm not going to get into what our EBIT Guidance might or might not be on a quarterly or annual basis because we have guided that it will be down. And we do continue to make the investments we expect it to make. And we are using -- we are making incremental investments in the business using the tax savings that we spoke about in March. I would remind you that all of that said we generated about $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year when you look at cash provider from operating activities minus our CapEx, which is the pretty standard definition. And we're promising $6.5 billion over the next three years. So I think we're off to a pretty nice start to the $6.5 billion. And when you think about the valuation of a company, its ability to grow free cash flow over time. I think we are pretty solid in that respect.","Chris Mandeville","Okay and then one quick clarification then the follow-up. The comp you actually have seen over 2% in Q2. Was that both price investment and space optimization or strictly space optimization?","Mike Schlotman","It's both of them together.","Chris Mandeville","Okay and then so my follow up would be, just obviously as relates to pending storms, all are of course unique but can you just remind us the general dynamics that you observe on both the top-line and margins during these sort of events and then how well do you feel from an inventory standpoint in advance of the hurricane and did you see any element of acceleration in transportation or freight costs in the southeast quarter to date?","Mike Schlotman","Well, I don't know if I would go specifically in the southeast, that's pretty narrowly focused. We talked it that rising transportation cost affected the gross margin rate overall. When you look at the dynamics of what's going on in the southeast of the country today before I get into the specifics, I want to repeat something I said earlier today, and our hearts and minds and prayers and thoughts are with both our associates and customers in that part of the world because they stand to face a pretty difficult next couple of three weeks. And we hope we come through it as well as possible from their standpoint, And the business will be the business.","I would tell you that last year this time we had a run-up to Hurricane Irma that people forget about, and this-- and right and that would have been prior to today, and today we have the run-up to Hurricane Florence, and they kind of offset one another. So we had the comparison to the run-up to Irma that was a headwind at the beginning of the quarter. And now that's been replaced by the incremental sales you get from Florence. And when you factor those out, they pretty well negate one another and we're trending above with both of those in there, where we finish this --the second quarter.","So we feel like we're off to a good start.","Rodney McMullen","Mike said it, but there's no two hurricanes the same. We have a lot of experience on reacting and addressing hurricanes and our teams always do an incredible job and work beyond anything that one could expect. But our customers and we all appreciate everything they're doing. Obviously, the first thing is making sure everybody stays safe. But I know yesterday, I received an email from a customer whose daughter lived in one of the affected markets. In the email, she said how much she appreciated the fact that we had water and some other things because other retailers didn't have it. And to the degree that we're able to do things like that, it really is a reflection of our store teams and our warehouse teams and delivery teams making sure that our stores stay in stock. And it's one of those things we do have a lot of experience at it.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. And Rodney, when you look at what our Atlanta, Harris Teeter, and mid-Atlantic division teams have done to serve the customers and keep our associates safe -- our hats are off to them.","Operator","The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kelly Bania","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a clarification and then a longer-term question. On the space optimization, the comment that the IDs would be over 2% if you take that out, is that more of a traffic disruption or a ticket and pricing disruption?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. It actually is both. And it's more the average ticket because customers have trouble finding stuff. But it's actually a little bit of both. What we find, once you get through it though, the customers -- you reallocate the space in the stores, you'll have products that the customer wanted to buy from us that we didn't have before, and we stay better in stock as well because you reallocate space. So the customers never like it during that. But once you get through it, the customers appreciate what you do and reward us accordingly.","Kelly Bania","Okay. That's helpful. And then just some longer-term questions. I guess first, on Ocado, just a simple question. But with all the growth in Instacart and expanded partnership there, it seems like the same day delivery, maybe there's a lot of demand for that. But I'm just wondering if Ocado will be also able to offer same day one- or two-hour delivery or if that's more of a next day type offering. Any comments on that would be helpful. And then on Alibaba, just wondering if you're willing to frame what you think the potential could be for that longer-term in terms of dollars, when that starts, and if you'll include that in your IDs. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. In terms of Ocado, the Ocado team continues to work on improving their model using even better machine learning and everything else. There will be certain areas that they will be able to do same day end. I think the key thing gets back to the comment that we talked about regularly. That's being able to deliver anything any time, anywhere. And it really will be able -- the key will be able to, for the customers, to do it in a seamless way. And we'll use all of the assets, including Ocado, our store facilities, and other things to be able to get deliveries to the customers based on when they want it. ","What we find is there are certain items that customers want more immediately, if you think about what's for dinner tonight. There are other things that you could help them plan out. And the thing that they're more focused on there is getting it in a convenient way. And a convenient way sometimes is picking it up, not necessarily at the store they shop at, and in some cases, delivery. So, the key is all of the backstage assets tying together but delivering it seamlessly for the customer.","And what we find is some customers like same day or a couple hour delivery windows. Others are more focused on pick up. And next day is not -- they view that as equally convenient. On Alibaba, on the identicals, Mike, I'll let you --","Mike Schlotman","Our definition is sales to customers. So, over time, those will probably wind up being in the ID sales. As we've said, we're kind of dipping our toe in the water at this point to make sure we have systems and processes down. And it's just an expansion of our ability to attract customers regardless of where they are.","Rodney McMullen ","Yes. On Alibaba and what I've been doing at investor meetings recently on Simple Truth, the question -- they ask you the same thing in terms of how big. And it really is, for us, hard to estimate. It's something that we haven't done before. But what we find is that our Simple Truth brand has incredibly strong customer connection. And we believe that it's a brand that will work across the world not just the US. And learning and doing that in China is an easy first step. ","And Alibaba's Tmall is an incredible platform to reach over a half a billion customers. So it's really learning and looking at it in terms of is it a brand that will travel internationally. And then does that create a platform for growth? And we certainly think the opportunity is there. It's going to take a lot of work to achieve that.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Paul Trussell","Thank you. Good morning. Just circling back on -- as you mentioned numerous times, 2018 is a year of investments for you guys, as you pull forward actions on labor and price and store remodels. Just kind of remind us or as we look to the second half, are there a different set of puts and takes that we should keep in mind versus the first half on the EBIT front? And just kind of remind us of what's embedded in that 2020 plan in terms of the margin profile.","Mike Schlotman","I won't get into EBIT on a short-term period like the back half of the year because we haven't given guidance on that. What we've given guidance on is we expect to grow operating profit or EBIT by $400 million over the course of 2018, 2019, and 2020, as compared to where 2017 ended up when you adjust out the 53rd week and you adjust out the convenience store business because obviously, we don't have that going forward. But we sold that for a very nice multiple. So that's what we're very focused on.","We talked about the fact in March; when the tax act was there that we're gonna make investments that would reduce EBIT this year. That would be offset by -- on the bottom line by a lower tax expense, and from a cash-based standpoint, a lower cash tax expense. And a lot of those investments were pulled forwards from either later in 2018, meaning there'll be less effect in 2019 or actual pull forward investments from 2019 into 2018. So we will expect ourselves from an internal standpoint to grow EBIT more in 2019 and probably into 2020 than we would have in the original Restock Kroger because we were able to get some of those investments behind us in 2018. And hopefully, see those take root and create that extra EBITDA to support our strategy.","Paul Trussell","Got it, thank you. And then just some quick ones. In this past period, to what extent did your private brands outperform national brands? And also, if you can just give an update on the Click and Collect program and all the contributors to your digital growth being over 50% this past quarter.","Mike Schlotman","So in Rodney's prepared comments, he talked about Our Brand being 28.2% of units and 26.5% of dollars, both of which are record results for the second quarter. The second quarter is usually a bit of a dip as compared to the first quarter and other quarters, but primarily because of soft drinks because with the summer holidays, national brand soft drinks have a very strong performance because of the promotions that wind up happening. ","And when you look at the ClickList and the expansion of digital and the fact that it's up 50%, we talk about the fact that we're up to 80% of our customers now have the ability to either interact with ClickList or one of the home delivery services we have which is up from about 70% in the first quarter. So we can see continued growth of our customers being able to interact with us that way.","Operator","The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel","So, Rodney, let me hit private brands first. What have you found your data with price elasticity, private brands versus national brands? And then when you make some price investments on the private brand side, what is the national brand response, if any to those? Or do they do nothing?","Rodney McMullen","Okay. I love the question and there are a lot of pieces behind the question. If you look at our brands and the broad spectrum of our brands, each brand would have a little bit different answer to the question. So if you look at Private Selection, as a general rule, those are unique items where there really isn't a comparable brand somewhere else. So our brand on Private Selection really is very innovative, new approaches. Same for like HemisFares and some of those. ","So the customer reaction is more in terms of doing something when we keep it fresh and exciting or a flavor that they can't find somewhere else. And that engages with the customer that way. Simple Truth really doesn't have a comparable brand in the market at all and to the degree that obviously, there are a lot of smaller natural and organic brands, but it would compete against one piece of our overall brand not the overall brand.","And certainly, what our strategy always has been on natural and organic products is you shouldn't have to pay a premium just because it's a natural or organic. It shouldn't have a higher margin in it. And that's been our strategy for numerous years. And our customers have reacted to that very well. When you look at the core banner brand, it really depends on the category. So you think about milk, the market share is so high, there's really not a lot of elasticity there.","Others would have a different type of elasticity. Overall, you really don't find the national brands reacting much at all in the short term. Usually, the reaction is more longer term. And it's usually after a year or two of losing share that they decide that they want to do something about the share. And then they'll come back and be more aggressive. The key to all of it -- and we want the national brands and our brands both to grow. And one of the key is innovation. And I know almost every time I talk to a national brand partner, I always tell them that, you need more innovation. Our teams feel the same way in terms of -- the key is really more innovation.","John Heinbockel","And then real quick, on the $400 million, roughly what comp is required over the two years to get there? And with Ocado investments right as you start to move toward implementation of the first three or five, would they impact the $400 million at all? Or no, it's immaterial?","Mike Schlotman","The pick of those investments won't start happening until 2020. And it's factored into our ability to generate the $400 million. And we would still be targeting to generate the $400 million of operating profit margin growth, even in light of having the Ocado investments and starting to come online or close to coming online or early. Hopefully, some time in that timeframe.","Operator","The next question comes from Robbie Holmes with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, Robbie. ","Robert Holmes","Okay. Thanks for fitting me in. I was hoping --","Mike Schlotman ","In under the wire.","Robert Holmes","Really appreciate it. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The price investments, Rodney or Mike, can you just talk about how much of it is skewed toward own brands versus history? Is it a massive investment in your own brand pricing that's driving your gross margin down and you've eased off price investments on national brands?","Rodney McMullen","It would really be across both national brand and our brands. And it really is using our 8451 insights to understand where is the best return for the price investment. So it's actually very much both.","Robert Holmes","And then just the very last question would just be some of your Walmart example, as one example, you saw some strong results from some very large retailers, even in their food retail businesses in the second quarter. And just maybe help us think about what the consumer is doing from your standpoint. Are you seeing signs of trade up? And should we see a reversal of market share trends back in your favor at some point when you get through this?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at market share overall on the data, the way that everything's been historically tracked, we continue to gain share. If you look at overall, we're pretty much on track where we thought we would be, as Mike mentioned earlier. We continue to see overall market growth which is good. And we see great opportunities out there to continue to do well what we do good. And that's our strength with our associates and their service and freshness of product. So we continue to see plenty of opportunity to improve our identicals and gain share.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Robbie. As I just mentioned, we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger and especially with our execution of Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, as all of you know, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So before I end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments with our associates. ","First, as Mike mentioned before, I would like to acknowledge that many of our customers and associates are bracing for Hurricane Florence. I know our stores and logistics teams on the east coast have been working tirelessly for the past week to help our customers and each other be prepared for the storm. For those of you in the hurricane's path, please stay safe and look out for each other. Second, as I mentioned earlier on the call, we are thrilled that Kroger was included in Fortune Magazine's 2018 Change the World list for Zero Hunger Zero Waste.","This is such an awesome recognition of the work that each one of you are doing to help us achieve our goal. The same week we received the news from Fortune, Kroger was making news of our own. We added a bold new pledge to our existing Zero Hunger Zero Waste commitments by 2025. And that was that we will be phasing out single-use plastic checkout bags. The feedback on that announcement has been enormous and overwhelmingly positive. I know everything that you are doing are steps to make this become a reality. Thank you for all you do. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12990":["Kroger Co.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Rebekah Manis","Thank you, Laura. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, that Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","At our investor conference at the end of October, we shared several big ideas. The defining idea is that we are transforming our business model through Restock Kroger and then beyond. We will grow market share by both redefining Kroger customer experience and alternative profit streams through complementary businesses and partnerships.","Redefining the customer experience means offering customers incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering, and friendly and caring associates. Delivering an exceptional customer experience through the Kroger ecosystem creates incremental new profit streams, which in turn drives the economic model that makes the seamless experience possible.","In this way, our new growth model will be a virtuous cycle. This all means that Kroger is also reinventing our financial model. We're moving from a traditional grocer to a growth company with both a strong customer ecosystem that offers anything, anytime, anywhere, and asset light high margin alternative partnerships and services. I will break it down a bit in more detail. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top line.","At our investor conference, we highlighted one of the most successful to-date Kroger Personal Finance as well as several businesses under our 8451 portfolio including our Kroger Precision Marketing media offering.","Kroger Personal Finance delivered record year-to-date profit and is on track for the most profitable year ever. Our high-margin media business is strong and growing. Revenue for Kroger Precision Marketing powered by 8451 is up more than 150% year-to-date. One service line, our boosted products and search business, where advertisers can influence how their products show up on our sites benefited advertisers with more than 700 million product impressions in the third quarter alone, personalized to Kroger shoppers with click to conversion rates that are 2x to 3x the industry standard. We see tremendous potential in these asset-light, margin rich businesses, build off of a robust grocery supermarket experience which is being redefined everyday at Kroger.","Nowhere is this more obvious than digital. Our digital sales grew by over 60% in the third quarter. Our seamless coverage area now reaches more than 90% of Kroger households. This includes Kroger Pickup and Delivery. Kroger Ship is now available in all supermarket divisions. Ship customers can shop from a curated selection informed by 8451 data and insights of more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter the most to our customers plus there are 4,500 Our Brands products available only from Kroger.","We are aggressively investing to build digital platforms because they give our customers the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger, and because they're a catalyst to grow our business and improve margins in the future.","As we stated at our Investor Day, we expect to be able to cover not only 100% of our customers but also the entire U.S. population. Our Brands continue to perform exceptionally well with customers and is one of the most profitable parts of our supermarket business. Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.6% of sales dollars, both of which are record third quarter results. Our Private Selection and Simple Truth brands saw strong sales, units, and gross margin gains in the third quarter.","Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic is our fastest growing brand, with sales up double digits again in this third quarter. As we've shared previously, Our Brands account for 4 of the top 5 items sold through Kroger Pickup, and 41 of the top 50 items sold on Kroger Ship.","We have now been executing for three quarters our Restock Kroger plan to create shareholder value by redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value, developing talent, and living our purpose.","We feel good about the progress and how everything is coming together. We are proactively investing for the future in stores and online and in our customers and associates. We're using our assets especially, our love of people and our love of food to transform our business in ways that drive sustainable competitive advantage.","Now, here is Mike to share more details on our third quarter results and to update you on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney and good morning, everyone.","We are pleased with our net adjusted operating earnings per diluted share result of $0.48 for the third quarter. Strong fuel margins and continued execution of Restock Kroger contributed to this result. We continue to make several Restock Kroger investments in the third quarter. These included investments in price, especially in support of our brands and in space optimization, store remodels, and technology enhancements.","Part of these investments will allow customers to buy anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger. As we discussed at our investor conference, space optimization is a massive undertaking, and we continue to expect to end the year with 600 stores completed.","Our ID sales for the third quarter were in line with our expectation. ID sales were led by natural foods, pharmacy, seafood, produce, and deli departments. Looking at gross margin, we were pleased to see that our shrink rate continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the previous year.","The gross margin rate reflects the timing and size of company\u2019s price investments compared to a year ago, rising transportation costs, and growth of the specialty pharmacy business, which is a high sales, low margin rate business that generates strong gross profit dollars. Keep in mind that last year in the third quarter, our gross margin rate was higher than our typical run rate.","For the third quarter in 2018, gross margin excluding fuel was actually higher than the second quarter of 2018. These fluctuations illustrate how results in the given quarter can vary based on the cadence of the investments we make in the business. Part of our investments this year support the Our Brands strategy where we continue to offer high quality products at a great value. The improvement in unit movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers.","We intended to continue investing in price to drive unit growth while also delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. We are pleased that OG&A cost decreased by 20 basis points as a rate of sales. The significant improvements we're seeing from our focus on reducing store associate turnover is contributing to this positive movement.","We continue to focus on productivity and waste and improvements in our cost to build prescriptions and increased adoption of self scan contributed to this improvement. Our investments in Restock Kroger and redefining the customer experience partnering for customer value and developing talent we pay for by cost of good savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This will contribute to generating $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020.","Now for an update on our retail fuel performance during the third quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.261 compared to $0.249 in last year's third quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.81 compared to $2.46 in the same quarter last year.","We expect our tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 23%, excluding the 2018 adjustment items, Kroger expects its factory to be approximately 21%. These rates reflect a third quarter adjustment related to a regular IRS audit. The IRS audit resulted in a reduction in prior year tax deductions at pretax reform rates and future tax deductions at post tax reform rates.","Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last four quarters, we used cash to invest the combined $589 million in Ocado securities and Home Chef contribute an incremental $185 million pretax to a company sponsored pension plan, $467 million to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the central states pension fund, repurchased 91 million common shares for $2.3 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under its accelerated stock repurchase plan.","We paid $435 million in dividends and we invested $3 billion in capital excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.","We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of restock free cash flow by 2020 as part of our Restock Kroger plan. We have working capital improvements built into this guidance and off to a great start with $100 million improvement in net operating capital - net operating working capital so far this year.","Kroger's net total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52 week basis is 2.72. Our net total debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio target is 2.3x to 2.5x and we remain committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range. We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates, in wages, training and development over the next three years to Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.","In March, we also announced investing a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program Feed Your Future and an increased 401-k match for non-union associates. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many of our competitors don't offer.","We recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering more than 13,000 Kroger associates in Columbus, Ohio. The agreement raises starting wages and accelerates wage progressions after one year of service. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates.","Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to the guidance for the remainder of 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth excluding fuel in the second half to be similar to the first half results. We updated our GAAP net earnings guidance to $3.80 to $3.95 per diluted share for 2013 from the previous range of $3.88 to $4.03.","The change in GAAP guidance is due to the third quarter market value adjustment of $0.09 per diluted share for Kroger's investment in Ocado shares and does not reflect any future changes in the market value of those shares because those cannot be predicted.","On an adjusted basis, we maintained our net operating earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018 and keep in mind that fiscal 2017 included an extra week. We continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2018.","And now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike.","We're not quite through our first year of executing Restock Kroger, and we feel great about where we are. We are laser focused on our customers and fulfilling their needs. We are clear on our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Our 2018 accomplishments and investments set us up well for 2019, and we are committed to delivering on our Restock Kroger financial targets by the end of 2020. We have a clear path through both redefining the customer experience and growing alternative profit streams.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","I just wanted to ask a bit further on the alternative revenue streams. Ssince your guy's Investor Day, we on the phone of course, have been getting a lot of questions from investors as well around that. You called out today kind of the Kroger Personal Finance seeing nice results there, but can you just kind of give us a little bit more color on that specifically and just kind of I think as a category alternative revenue streams, kind of what are some of the puts and takes? We know it's one of the more important components of your EBIT guide?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at the October meeting, we went through several different ones. Obviously, today if you look at, we highlighted Kroger Personal Finance in October because we wanted everybody to see that we actually have a great track record of delivering against - identifying new business opportunities and having a growth - grow in a meaningful way that's actually substantial to us.","One of the announcements that we made last year was the Kroger Precision Marketing where we're using the - insights from 8451. All of those things are really based on the traffic from our stores and our digital properties in creating a seamless experience for customers. And all of those things that we're doing will help our customers shop one of our stores easier, and like in the media experience, it will allow our CPG partners and other people to target specific customers through our pipeline.","If you look at over the last four years, the compounded annual growth from a profitability standpoint has been 16%. If you look at our expectations, as you look at '18 through '20, we would expect that to accelerate to 28% growth per year. And certainly, the progress that we're having in '18 would support the 16% that we projected based on the historical 4 years. Mike, anything you want to add?","Mike Schlotman","No, I think we also - Rodney gave some color on the Kroger Precision Marketing. The fact that it's up 150% year-to-date, and I think it's pretty impressive that the boosted search of relatively new product with 700 million product impressions just this third quarter, and when you get click-to-conversion ratios, 2 times to 3 times industry standard, that's the kind of thing that keeps that momentum going and keeps third parties interested in continuing to have that boosted search.","Vincent Sinisi","And then maybe just as a fast followup, just in the press release this morning, just with some of the price investment commentary, is that -- would you say kind of normal cadence nothing out of kind of the ordinary or did you see any particular changes on the competitive front or by category this quarter?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I would say, just if you look at the overall strategy, it's executing the overall strategy that we started -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year, but we've been embarking upon for several years. So, I wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary as Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, last year's third quarter was higher than trend line.","The other thing, I think it's important just to note is that we did have a couple new warehouses starting up, and a warehouse conversion that also negatively affected the margins in the quarter and those are one time. Well, it will take a couple of quarters for those to get started up in the transition, but that also negatively affected the quarter.","Operator","The next question will come from Karen Short of Barclays.","Karen Short","So I just wanted to ask a question about full year guidance and the implied fourth quarter. So the range is pretty wide for 4Q, getting kind of like $0.38 to $0.53. So I'm wondering, if you could just give a little color on that and the puts and takes to operating margin and then I guess maybe comment on the guidance in light of the fact that gas margins seemed pretty strong in the quarter to date, and I know in the past when that has been the case, you've pulled forward expenses into the fourth quarter or into the quarter whatever the quarter was, were there is strong gas margins, so a little color there would be helpful.","Rodney McMullen","Sure Karen and the wide range, we all agree here at Kroger that the range for the fourth quarter is quite wide keeping it at $0.15 and it's purely driven by what you zeroed in on and that's gasoline margins and where they wind up because they've been very volatile over the last several weeks while a very strong year they can turn pretty quickly both positively and negatively, and if you think about what one margin in gallon means to earnings per share or $0.01 margin per gallon means to earnings per share, it can equate to almost $0.01 a share.","That volatility is what caused us to decide to keep the range fairly wide. It has nothing to do with our view of how the business is going to operate in the fourth quarter. It's purely, will margins continue to be strong? Will they get weak the next - will they get weaker the next five or six weeks or where exactly will they go, and it's really - you're unable to predict where those margins go on a weekly basis, so we just decided to keep it a little wider purely based on where gas margins may wind up in the fourth quarter.","Karen Short","Okay, so is it fair to think though if they remain strong, you will pull expenses into the fourth quarter or it's just impossible to predict?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I wouldn't necessarily predict pulling expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at where we are sitting here in early December, our promotional activity and our ads are pretty well set, how we plan to go to market over the holidays coming up and New Years and even as we get into later January, getting ready for the college football playoffs and the Super Bowl, all those big events. Those kinds of plans are pretty well locked and loaded and the supply chain is ready for those kinds of activities to come through.","So to do a lot of other unusual things in the next, call it eight weeks, eight and half weeks would be, I think, we're pretty comfortable with the plans we have in place.","Karen Short","And then just a general question on the alternative revenue streams. I mean, presumably those are high gross margin, and this quarter isn't really the quarter to see the flow through obviously given the comparisons from last year, but gross margins were still a little lower than we're modeling but any color on how to think about how alternate revenue streams will impact reported gross margin ex-fuel going forward?","Rodney McMullen","I wouldn't - longer term, I wouldn't say that we're really to a position to start giving some of the detailed insights. Your hypothesis is absolutely correct in terms of the margins and our alternative profit streams are significantly higher than the core business which is one of the reasons why we want to make sure that we call it out and point it out.","The other thing as you know that's incredibly important in that space, its typically very asset light. So if you look at Kroger Personal Finance, we have an incredibly strong partnership with the bank. The assets that's used to grow that business is reasonably modest. If you look at Kroger Precision Marketing, it's using insights and data to create that revenue stream.","So it's easily scalable as long as you're producing the results for your customers. So it's a piece that's incredibly exciting. In terms of giving some specifics, I just think, it's still a little too early for that.","Operator","The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Could we start with just IDs, maybe talk about the cadence of the IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in the current quarter and any update on the optimization drag? I think, obviously your guidance implies Q4 will be better, I'm just curious as to whether you're seeing some of that yet?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at the cadence throughout the quarter was fairly consistent throughout the quarter. As you look at so far this quarter, we would be in the same range as where we ended the third quarter. So we've started off at about the same spot. When you look at space optimization and the fact that we're in a holiday season, we've been disciplined to not have stores disrupted during the holiday season.","So we would expect to have those stores start to perform better like we talked about at the Investor Conference. We will start up next year's space ops, we will start some stores in January after the holiday season. When you think about the slide, I showed at the Investor Conference on space op, what we're seeing in ID sales for those stores is not materially different than what I showed back in October.","Edward Kelly","And then I wanted to ask you about SG&A. It was a positive surprise this quarter for sure. Can you talk about your ability to drive 20 basis points of OpEx leverage this quarter. And you've been talking about cost discipline, but is this now starting to inflect into the P&L. And I'm just kind of curious as we think about things going forward, how we should be thinking about this line item, how important is it to your $400 million over time. Just any color there would be good in terms of like what this quarter means is to how we think about modeling going forward?","Mike Schlotman","I think what it means is a lot of what you said and when you look at the areas that I called out in the prepared comments, when you think about retention and our retention getting significantly better than it has, it does multiple things, one, you don't spend the dollars you have to spend to hire somebody just the actual hard cost of getting somebody into the system, whether you do a background check or any kinds of other screenings on the individual, getting them through a training program and then getting them on to the sales floor. At a productivity level lower than someone who has six or nine months experience.","So when you have more and more people who have that six to nine months experience and start to get to the 12 months experience that helps the productivity inside the store. More people then wind up staying particularly the part time work force as they start to understand and appreciate when they're here six months, they start to get the benefit of future where they can get $3,500 a year towards furthering their education. That cost while it sounds expensive, actually will be offset by that person staying for another 12 months or 18 months versus having that person turn a couple of times and having lower productivity and training.","So you kind of create a virtuous cycle and better opening wage rates, more contemporary benefits, helping them with their college education or GED or English as a second language. We have a lot of folks that here work for Kroger in management positions that have decided to go back and get their MBA and other advanced degrees certification. So all of those together help with that.","We continue to see improvements in our cost of filling our pharmacies. Our pharmacy business continues to be very strong piece. Our script count on a 30 day adjusted basis continues to grow nicely and as we leverage that and are able to leverage down our cost to fill prescriptions that certainly helps.","And then the efforts we've had both on our front end transformation that we try to working with space op when possible of reconfiguring the self checkout unit so that it's an easier and more friendly experience for our customers and then the added benefit of the Scan, Bag and Go.","All those help create productivity which is a positive to it. Lot of things I said there. I don't know that I would promise 20 basis points going forward but certainly cost reduction as we've been talking since we announced Restock Kroger in October '17 is a very important part of getting the $400 million of operating profit.","Rodney McMullen","I agree totally with everything that Mike said and I think, the last part that Mike said is the important part, as you look at now through 2020, you should expect to see us reducing costs of - how much cost it takes us to operate our business and Mike gave a bunch of several great examples. But we're really - our operations team is doing a great job working with our stores and our technology team on some innovation ideas to improve processes and take cost out.","So it's really all of those pieces working together but absolutely as you look out through 2020, you should expect us to improve cost and how much it costs us to operate our business.","Operator","And the next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Michael Lasser","In light of the fact that space optimization disruption should be a little less in the fourth quarter, plus given the reacceleration on your price investment. Should we expect that IDs - they're going to meaningfully accelerate in the subsequent month of your fourth quarter?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, I think the only place I would go on ID sales is our guidance as we expect the second half to be comparable to the first half. Our third quarter was close to the second quarter and our first quarter was a little better than the second quarter.","So we do have a little bit of ground to make up on that guidance but we didn't - we said similar, we didn't say exactly equal to. But we are expecting a little bit better fourth quarter. We are working hard to do that, and I think we have great plans in place.","Michael Lasser","And Mike, what would be the offset to some of those benefits, are there industry factors, consumer pressures what are your thoughts there?","Mike Schlotman","I don't know what do you mean by offsets?","Michael Lasser","Because you're going to see less disruption from space optimization and you should get sales lift from the price investments that you've been making. So I am just wondering if there is some offsetting drags?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, I wouldn't point in any particular offsetting drag as it relates to the top line. Keep in mind, our fuel rewards program continues to be incredibly important to our customers and our associates when they think about the total value that we give them on a day in, day out basis and that $0.10 a gallon they get off, keep in mind, we reduce reported IDs for that, because you have to buy groceries to get the lower fuel discount, not all of our competitors account for that way.","So as that continues to be popular and more and more people engage in that. We're selling more in the stores but it actually slows how quickly ID sales grows just because of the way we do our accounting. So there are always puts and takes on that top line.","Michael Lasser","And my follow up question is on Kroger Personal Finance. Seeing very healthy growth, what's been driving that and how much of that is private label credit card?","Rodney McMullen","It's really all the portfolio of products they offer. So in the last two or three years, we've done a couple of mergers with Roundy's and Harris Teeters. So there's good growth there. There's good growth in the existing business and then the credit card business continues to be an incredible tie in for loyalty for our Kroger customers.","So it's really all pieces of that business continues to grow. Obviously, credit write offs are low as well but that's a pretty small part of the overall impact on the profitability of that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","In the past around this time of year, you've provided some initial thoughts about the upcoming fiscal year at least on some occasions. Mike, at the Investor Day, you did say, I think 2019 has to have some - I think the word you used was decent operating profit margin dollars. I just wanted to see if you can elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you're expecting next year in general for next year, are there any unique tailwinds, headwinds we should be thinking about just opening up that topic if we can?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I won't go too far on 2019 but it's - if you go all the way back to 2017 and then the first quarter of this year, when we talk about pulling forward some investments from '19 and then the '18, clearly operating profit margin has to grow in 2019 over 2018 and start that march to the $400 million that we're going to generate over the three years of the Restock Kroger plan.","I will say and I knew at some point we will get this question because we were a little - we were pretty more prescriptive this time last year on the call about what we expected for 2018 and a lot of that had to do with the fact that we had a range of estimates out there at that point in time that were as low as in the $1.40s and $1.50s and up to about $2.20 kind of range, it was a massive range.","And what we were trying to do was rein in that range as we guide into the end of the year and knowing that we were going to give guidance in March. We didn't want that wide of a range out there. I think today people are understanding that this is a three year program we're undertaking and as we make - as we pull those investments from '19 into '18, they should start generating a little bit more in '19 and then even more in '20. So it is a three year growth algorithm to get to the $400 million but we continue to see a clear path to the $400 million.","Mike Schlotman","The other point that I would add and we talked about it in October is if you look at digital, our overall digital business continues to be a significant investment for the future of the business. And we would expect for '19 just that to become a less of a headwind than it was in '18 and that is also an important part to remember as well.","Ken Goldman","And then a follow up, if I look at your SG&A dollars and they were down year-on-year, if I exclude the one time pension contribution last year, some extra weeks, it actually was down for the first time and at least 22 years according to my model. So I realize you're gaining efficiencies of store associates, I get that personal finance is a counter SG&A item.","But I'm still not a 100% sure why that decline was so sudden. I mean, your SG&A came in $200 million below where the Street was. So can you help us understand a little bit of what the big dramatic change was in the quarter or maybe I'm just - we're all just modeling it wrong and didn't see something.","Mike Schlotman","From a dollar standpoint, Ken, don't forget that last year would have had the sea stores in our OG&A rate and they are disposed off now - in our dollars.","Ken Goldman","Yes, but last quarter in 2Q, you still were up year-on-year with SG&A. So it's little bit more of a dramatic change. I can follow up offline if it's - I don't want to hold everyone up on the call.","Mike Schlotman","We were up a little bit in the second quarter. I would say the second quarter is probably more a function of in the prior year, we would've had some bonus accrual reductions because of the year - where the year was heading that we didn't enjoy this year.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies.","Chris Mandeville","So I have noted, you guys are doing quite well on OG&A but gross margins were a bit lower than what we were all expecting. Mike, can you just maybe help ballpark the impacts on gross margins based on the noted items that you called out and I know, you don't necessarily like to guide to any one line item but just given the particular strength and fuel margins that we're seeing quarter-to-date and how that plays into overall earnings. Can you give us a sense of just how to think about gross margins ex-Q1, Q4?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, if you think about that margin rate in Q4, I'm more comfortable doing that than listing out the effects in any one quarter of some of those things because one quarter is not an indication of where they go long term. The one I did call out is Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, it's a very profitable business. It has a very low margin rate but because of the individual cost of those prescriptions for the patients, it generates very strong gross margin dollars, which is why we're in that business and as that business continues to grow, it will be a headwind. That one alone was a double digit basis point headwind. I won't give the exact amount.","When you think about the fourth quarter, you should probably think about the fourth quarter change in gross margin rate the way we talk about that basis point change being more similar to the second quarter than the third quarter.","Chris Mandeville","And then just my follow up. Over the last couple of week now, we've seen several sizable product recalls and I think some of that was even specific to the Kroger brand in both meat and pet food. So I'm just curious on what Kroger has been doing of late or what they planned to do when it comes to the supply chain and improving sourcing, helping mitigate recall costs.","Rodney McMullen","But, if you look, food safety has been something that Kroger has been incredibly proud of for many, many years and we have a team of folks here that that is their only responsibility is to make sure that products are safe throughout the food channel. We will do routine audits of our suppliers as part of that process.","One of the things that we are incredibly proud of is in the unfortunate situation where there is a recall, we reach out to our customers and let them know that there's a recall on products they've bought. So that we try to get that customer to get the product back to us as quick as possible to make it easy on them and to let them know. It's something that we also review with our board on a regular basis.","If you look at severity of incidence, we've actually over the last five or six years there's been a decline on severe incidents. Now, if you look at overall recalls, that continues to increase just because I think the overall food safety chain in the US continues to improve.","Chris Mandeville","And maybe just two quick housekeeping questions. What was inflation, deflation in the quarter and was there any notable call out from hurricane impacts on the comp or expansion for that matter?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, if you look at the hurricane impacts, it would have been a little bit of a headwind to ID sales. We didn't necessarily call it out primarily because it wasn't that dramatic but it was several basis points of a headwind more than a couple but it's not like it was 20 basis point or 30 basis point, so. But it was meaningful but not directionally going to change the answer. If you look at your question on inflation deflation, I'm looking at my chart here. I have 30-year-olds mega chart for their eyes, not my eye.","So if you look at inflation deflation without fuel and pharmacy on a cost basis, we had about 11 basis points of inflation. If you put pharmacy back into the mix, we had about 22 basis points of inflation. So a very benign environment. It ranges around the categories of who had some inflation and deflation and there were some categories that had a little bit of inflation and others that had a fair amount of deflation.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","So on capital allocation, I was curious how quickly you anticipate being back to that 2.3% to 2.5% leverage ratio and then as we look out to next year, I know, you have $1 billion term loan coming due. So just curious, if you have any initial thoughts in terms of whether you would pay that down or refinance that debt?","Mike Schlotman","So we actually have about $1.1 billion of long term debt that is now classified as current coming due and call it the next 90 day or next 60 days some this month, some next month that we would anticipate refinancing that in the market. We do have forward starting swaps against both of the types of debt we would wind up expecting to issue at very favorable rates. The 30 years that is almost 100 basis points below where the 30 years today and the 10 years hedge not quite that strongly but almost as strongly.","We haven't decided exactly what we'll do with the term loan. It is - some of our banks like the business, some don't like the business but we certainly would have enough capacity with commercial paper to be able to use commercial paper to pay off the term loan if we chose to. We will have - we always have a financial policy committee meeting with our Board in January and we'll discuss our plans of how much flexibility do we want. If we rolled over the term loan and keeps more revolver capacity, so you can handle fluctuations day to day.","Relative to the net total debt to EBITDA range, we are always in contact with the rating agencies. They understand what our program is and we are executing against a program we've described to them relative to them keeping our ratings where they are.","Rodney McMullen","And it's important for us to get back into the range.","Mike Schlotman","Absolutely.","Rupesh Parikh","And then switching topics on price investments, so they clearly accelerated I think the past quarter or two, so just curious in terms of whether the volume uptick so far or thus far is meeting your expectations?","Mike Schlotman","I wouldn't - I don't know if I would be as strong in the comment that they clearly accelerated. If you go back to each of the quarter so far this year, we talked at the end of the first quarter that we started making the pull forward investments in the fourth quarter.","So from that standpoint, what we were pulling forward from '19 into '18, it's a fair assessment that beginning then, we did make those pull forward investments. I wouldn't characterize the third quarter as a big uptick and what our price investments plans were for the year, it's just that we continue to make the price investments throughout the year and it's more a function of how we make price investments last year a little bit choppier than we did this year.","Rupesh Parikh","And are they meeting your volume expectations as far as the volume uptick that you are seeing?","Mike Schlotman","We continue to be happy with what we're seeing from the results of the plan. It's not a single plan, it's not a single investment, so as with anything when you make price investments in a wide range of things, there are those out there that you probably are getting more volume than you expected and some not quite as much, not everyone's perfect but we're constantly stepping back and assessing all the results.","Overall, I would say, we're very happy with what our investments are giving us. I don't want to give the appearance that each and every one of them is perfect because that probably wouldn't be believable. But we are very happy with the collection of them and the ones that are doing well, we do more of them and the ones that aren't quite so well, we try to tweak and see what else might work.","Operator","The next question will come from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Just to follow up on the price investment, first. Can you give us some insight to how internally the decisions are made around seeing better fuel profitability and kind of how quickly you can turn that in to pull forward price investment and then how should we think about that pull forward, does it actually offset investments that you may have made next year or since the environment is so competitive is there just this race to the bottom with everybody?","Mike Schlotman","I wouldn't - it's obvious from some of the questions out there that there's this notion that when fuel profitability is very strong, we invest more in price and that's driving our gross margin down. I actually don't think that's true for this particular calendar year. We had our price program in place as part of Restock Kroger.","We knew what we wanted to invest this year. Washington gave us a Tax Reform Act that lowered our cash taxes, we elected to pull some of our investments from '19 into '18 to get that expense behind us in the first year of the lower taxes start to drive better growth in those categories as we get into '19. I don't - I wouldn't say that we've made any big moves on price as a result of strong fuel margins which is where everything shakes out.","Rodney McMullen","And the other thing I think it's always important to remember when we go to market, our fabulous associates in terms of the great experience they deliver and fresh product is also important. So for us, it's the overall shopping experience that we're trying to create for the customer and we're aggressively investing in the anything, anytime, anywhere, so they can do it anyway they want to whether that's digital, delivery, pickup or physically in the store, and have the same great experience and great fresh product all - and all those together.","Judah Frommer","And then just a quick follow up on the OG&A line. I would say historically, your unionization was sort of - as kind of a knock on the business, and today, I would say that the expansion into online and digital as a needing incremental investment in OG&A but would you say, we're at a point where the unionization may be helping you in some ways given the tightness of the labor environment and is there anything you can do to dispel online grocery necessarily adding meaningfully to SG&A or bringing down the margin there.","Mike Schlotman","I think, when you look at our workforce overall, whether you're unionized or non-unionized. When I look at - because not 100% of Kroger is unionized and when I look at overall results in a unionized market versus a non- unionized market whether it's at the end of the day the OG&A rate and what you pay associates to perform their jobs, when you look at your employee relations, employee satisfaction, there's really not a tremendous difference between those particularly in the wages.","But we offer all of our associates a great health care option and if they're in a union, they're in a more defined benefit plan. If they're not in the union, they would be in - some of them would be in a defined benefit plan but some are in a defined contribution plan.","So it's really a mix of benefits inside those, when I look at some of the home delivery and the online stuff that you refer to. There's a lot of cost in that system that everybody can point to and say, how you're going to do it. It's one of the reasons we joined up with Ocado to build the fulfillment centers that we're going to start building and we announced the first one here in Cincinnati.","While, there are certain costs that will add at a part of the total supply chain for the customer. There are other parts of that cost that will come out of the supply chain, more efficient picking because it's done robotically. It's done significantly faster on a 50 item order compared to how long it takes a 50 item order inside the store. I don't take product from the manufacturer to the warehouse to the store. I take it from the manufacturer to the Ocado warehouse and then it goes right from there to the customer.","So there's different efficiencies which is overall why we think that's going to help offset some of the costs people are worried about.","Operator","And the next question comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Could you speak to any additional color around your digital business. I know you mentioned up 60%. Just kind of what you're seeing out of Kroger Ship versus pickup and Home Chef. In addition, if you can maybe just speak to the new pilot with Walgreens?","Rodney McMullen","There is a whole host of questions there. I'll try to organize it in a way that makes sense. As you mentioned, our digital business, overall grew over 60%. All pieces of the digital business continues to grow. If you look at what was the biggest drivers of the growth, it would certainly be continuing to add locations where customers can pick up and get delivery.","From an online standpoint and the stores that were already had it a year ago their continued growth and then Home Chef as well. Home Chef would be pretty much exactly where we thought it would be from a growth standpoint or where Pat and his team thought they would be and then we were part of it.","If you look at ship and some of the other pieces, it's still pretty early in the process. We would have had a lot more expenses in terms of setting up where all the systems worked versus so much of a sales driver. But obviously, over time, you would expect that to become more of a sales driver but that is very early in the ramp.","The relationship with Walgreens, it's - both of us are very excited about what it can be, but it's one of the things where you really have to start small and learn from it. And that's really the prioritization is let's take baby steps and see if we can identify something that works for a Wallgreens customer and a Kroger customer and some way that both of us can grow our business and make money.","So excited - you know the thing I guess I'm most excited about is when I spent time with our combined teams and their openness and aggressiveness on trying to identify something that's great for our customers, for both of our customers is the thing that's so exciting, but it's pretty early to be able to start giving some more specifics than that.","Paul Trussell","Then just to quickly circle back on inflation or lack thereof is clearly a benign environment in terms of the impact to your third quarter results. I just wanted to just circle back on your outlook, you know, as you think about what's to come over the next few months. Any change in your outlook on inflation deflation impact your results?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, I would say, no. I don't really see a lot out there. I know there's a lot of noise in the marketplace about CPG companies pushing price increases through and the like over time that we will see where that goes and how everybody winds up reacting to it. Keep in mind, when we talk about inflation deflation, it's relative to Kroger and not marketplace forces necessarily.","So it's our cost of goods this year versus our cost of goods last year and as everybody knows a key component of driving the $400 million of operating profit over the next three years is continued improvement in cost of goods So some of that deflation is actually doing things to get better pricing inside Kroger and that may not be something that's replicated at other places.","Rodney McMullen","The other thing, I think, it's always important to remember as I always think it's a dangerous thing for CPGs to raise their cost more than what the economic cost of something increasing and what we find over time when somebody does that, our own brands will pick up a disproportionate amount of share whenever somebody does that. So to me it's a fine balance that we're all doing to try to find what's that optimal price point.","Operator","And that final question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Just a couple of quick ones, sorry if I missed this, Mike, can you give us traffic versus ticket in the quarter? And maybe Rodney chime in. I'm just curious the tone of the customer through the quarter, were there any variances there? Are you seeing trade up when you look at what they're doing and then also again - again, sorry if I missed this but loyal households is that - was that still growing in 3Q similar to previous quarters? Thanks.","Mike Schlotman","Yes when you look at overall the basket value grew a little bit in the quarter. And that's primarily a result of mix of what's going inside the basket when you look at transactions in the quarter, when you add in all of the entities that was up - it was up a little bit in the quarter as well.","Rodney McMullen","The tone of the customer they continue to - the economy still feels very good, people continue to buy wine, that - anything that makes their life easier, they will aggressively buy. So wouldn't be anything and then from a household standpoint, we did continue to have slight growth in households as well.","Rodney McMullen","We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course many of our associates are shareholders as well.","So as always before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them. Last week, we celebrated Giving Tuesday in conjunction with our partner Feeding America, we set a goal to raise enough money to provide 4 million meals to those in need during this holiday season. Together with our customers, we raised enough to serve almost 6 million meals helping us move closer to our Zero Hunger Zero Waste goal of eliminating hunger in our communities.","Last Friday, a major earthquake rattled Alaska. We operate seven Fred Meyer stores that were affected and thankfully all of our associates and customers inside our stores were safe. I'm so proud of the awesome job that Fred Meyer and Kroger team did. Under the leadership of Joe Grieshaber and our teams, everybody work together to get all our stores opened within one day.","Each holiday season, I'm reminded of our privilege to serve more than 9 million customers, who shop with us every day. Every celebration or tradition is as unique as the customer who walks through our door. Among the hustle and bustle of the season, you welcome our customers and help to make their celebrations brighter. We lift our customer spirits and they uplift our spirits as well.","These are just a few examples of what it means to live our purpose to feed the human spirit. It's an amazing thing of what we can do together. Thank you for all you do for our customers, communities and each other.","Merry Christmas, happy holidays and Happy New Year to you and your family and all those listening in. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12994":["Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call December  5, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Rebekah Manis - Director, IR","William McMullen - Chairman & CEO","Gary Millerchip - SVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Edward Kelly - Wells Fargo Securities","Judah Frommer - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners","Antonio Tabet - Evercore ISI","Kenneth Goldman - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Erica Eiler - Oppenheimer","Michael Lasser - UBS Investment Bank","Joshua Kamboj - Morgan Stanley","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Good morning and welcome to The Kroger Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Rebekah Manis","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks for this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","William McMullen","Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip. I would like to thank those of you who were able to attend our investor conference last month where we shared our progress on Restock Kroger. We believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders. It provides us with a clear purpose and our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. It focuses us on redefining the customer experience, identifying the partners who will help us deliver customer value today and in the future and putting the right talent and teams in place to focus on growth in our supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses.","We are proud of the progress we have made, and we've learned from the challenges we've experienced. We are on track with a stable and growing supermarket business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued investment in seamless. We are growing our supermarket business by focusing on three levers to drive identical sales: fresh, power brands and data and personalization. And we continue to build a seamless ecosystem that is available, relevant and accessible for our customers. All of this combined to generate positive results in the third quarter.","We continued to grow identical sales, reduce costs and deliver strong free cash flow. We had a broad-based identical sales improvement. 15 of our divisions had increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the second quarter. We delivered a slightly improved FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Headwinds in pharmacy were offset by strong fuel performance during the quarter. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.","Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem for our customers. We know our customers value greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an essential component of growing overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth as well and share of wallet. So seamless is a both, not an either\/or.","Our data clearly shows that over time and after initial investments, the profitability of a digital customer is the same as an in-store customer. We continue to see an improving operating profit trend in digital, and therefore, our investments are maturing as expected and consistent with the graph we shared at Investor Day.","Our digital sales grew 21% in the third quarter. As we shared previously, we expect our digital sales growth to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer. We have expanded our digital coverage to reach 96% of our customers. This means that 96% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.","We continue to invest in digital platforms as this is where the customers are increasingly going to meet many of their needs. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion.","We continue the rollout of Ocado facilities. In November, Kroger announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Wisconsin. The automated warehouse will serve customers in Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana. What's so exciting about Ocado is their model to deliver to the customer is significantly less costly than our existing model and any of the other models we've examined as well. Not only will these facilities accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. One of the comments we made at IR Day is that Ocado keeps learning and improving their model. Ocado's recent announcement of a micro fulfillment center in Bristol is a good example of this.","We believe that the food industry is special. It is huge, a $1.5 trillion market. And not only do people need to eat, they love to eat. Food isn't a commodity, but it's the center of our lives. Customers deserve a partner like Kroger who can provide inspiration and fulfill their passion for food. And unlike our national competitors, Kroger is food first. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy fresh food that tastes amazing.","As we shared in November, fresh is an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Our product standards, selection criteria and supply chain are core strengths and are built to deliver first-to-market and best-of-season fresh products across the United States.","Our produce department led the way in sales for the quarter, demonstrating how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. In addition, we launched our Fresh for Everyone brand transformation campaign, and the initial feedback from both our customers and our associates is very positive.","One of the many ways we demonstrate our passion for food is through Kroger's best-in-class Our Brands portfolio. While many grocers offer private label products, Our Brands is a real differentiator for Kroger because our customers tell us through blind taste tests that Our Brands' quality is better than not only the competitors' private label products but also many leading national brands as well. Kroger's Our Brands grew 3.4% this quarter. We also introduced 231 new Our Brand items during the third quarter.","Kroger's third differentiating lever to drive identical sales growth is personalization. Data is a differentiator for Kroger. Many retailers have transactional data, but none have the customer data and the insights to make meaningful suggestions to their customers like Kroger. We continue to see incredible effectiveness and efficiency from a focus on loyal customers and investing in their satisfaction.","One specific area I'd like to highlight is our strong fuel points program. As we shared at the Investor Day conference last month, an amazing 83% of our loyal customers engage with our fuel rewards program each year. We are increasingly targeting promotion and personalization of fuel rewards, and fuel drove trips and sales in the third quarter.","We are using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, which adds up to a business built for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns.","Kroger continues to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.5 billion over the prior four quarters and continues to increase its dividend to create value for shareholders. We are confident that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future because of our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth.","Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders both today and the future.","And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Rodney and thank those of you who were able to attend or view the Investor Day webcast last month. As we shared in New York, our model for a strong and durable retail supermarket business begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. We believe that our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers is driving increased identical sales across our store and digital ecosystem.","To drive sustainable sales growth for the long term, we will continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to the customer. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience, with an even greater emphasis on fresh, Our Brands and personalization. We are demonstrating through the first three quarters of the year we are being very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business.","Our supermarket business and the traffic and data this generates serves as the foundation from which we are able to drive higher growth in our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses that we continue to expect to accelerate our results. We expect our model to deliver improved operating results over time and continued strong free cash flow, and we expect this to translate into a consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return through EPS growth driven by sustained net earnings growth and the return of cash to shareholders via share repurchase, plus a growing dividend over time.","Now I'd like to share third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.47 per diluted share. As noted in this morning's press release, that includes a $0.03 out-of-period charge that I will share more detail on in a moment. But first, I'll highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly robust.","Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the third quarter, and our fuel performance mitigated retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds in the quarter.","LIFO charge for the quarter was $23 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. We now estimate LIFO for the year to be approximately $90 million versus our original expectation of $50 million.","Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than the same period last year due to a decrease in the benefits of federal tax credits and an increase in reserves.","I'll now provide additional detail about two specific items that affected our results in the third quarter. First, the out-of-period charge of $29 million that I referenced earlier. This charge is related to a provision in a single pharmacy contract that should have been recognized over the previous six quarters. Given the complexity of the contract and the introduction of new clawback provisions, a part of the contract was misinterpreted. The required correction was identified in our standard management review process. This charge is not material to total company results, and the financial effect in each of the prior individual quarters was immaterial to net earnings per diluted share. However, the cumulative effect on our performance in the third quarter reduced adjusted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03 and gross margin by 9 basis points. We, therefore, felt it was important to provide a greater level of insight into this item. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2019 or 2020 as a result of this contract going forward.","I'd now like to talk about Lucky's Market. During our investor conference last month, we committed to continue to be disciplined in prioritizing capital allocation to improve return on invested capital and create sustainable shareholder return. As part of a portfolio review, we made the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives in relation to our investment in Lucky's Market. As a result of this review, the company has decided to divest its interest in Lucky's Market and recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter. Accounting rules require Kroger to record the gross amount in operating profit. However, the real economic interest to Kroger is a pretax charge of $131 million. Additional details are provided in the financial tables of our press release.","The impairment charge is a noncash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of this decision.","Turning now to some of the highlights in the third quarter as underlying trends were very robust. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.5% during the third quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched Restock program. Several supermarket departments outperformed the company, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. Digital contributed approximately 70 basis points to identical sales, with Kroger pickup and delivery continuing to show strong momentum.","Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $653 million compared to $664 million in the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the third quarter.","FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business.","Gross margin rate, excluding fuel and pharmacy, improved slightly in the quarter as cost of goods savings and growth in alternative businesses offset continued retail price investments.","While profitability in retail pharmacy is lower than we had budgeted this year, it remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns. We were pleased to see the decline in gross margin rate compared to last year was lower in the third quarter than the first two quarters of 2019, and this trend is expected to continue in quarter four.","As a result of continued growth in pharmacy sales, improved product sourcing and initiatives that lower the cost of fill trips, our expectation is that pharmacy profitability will be less of a headwind in 2020.","Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the third quarter compared to last year. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.","OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points. This was achieved through broad-based improvement of Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives.","We remain on track to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings achieved last year. We also have clear line of sight to the $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020 that we shared at our investor conference. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies.","Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change. As part of the company's ongoing evolution, store operating divisions recently evaluated and reduced middle management roles to ensure they have the right talent in the right roles closest to our customers in store leadership positions. As a result, Kroger incurred severance charges in the third quarter totaling $80 million.","Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discount at the pump. As Rodney mentioned, fuel is driving lower customer trips and sales, and the amount of fuel rewards paid to loyal customers increased by 8% in the third quarter.","The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 this quarter versus $2.81 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the third quarter.","Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continue to be the primary drivers of growth this year.","Kroger Precision Marketing continues to build momentum, increasing engagement to over 1,000 brands with a 90% retention rate and significantly higher spend. We have relationships with all major agency holding companies supporting their media activations as they deploy brand building programs. Our Media business continues to release new inventory and create new publisher relationships to support the demand of advertisers.","And now to update on labor relations. As we have previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's investments in our associates, we are improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development.","We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Southern California, Portland, Seattle and Michigan during the quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Memphis. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant today to associates. ","Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","A key element of our capital allocation strategy is to use our free cash flow to invest in the business and drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.","We committed to prioritize free cash flow in 2019 to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.5 billion, and Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.5 for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2.72 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range.","Now that we are operating within our target range, and as we expect to generate strong free cash flow, we anticipate starting to buy back shares in the fourth quarter under our $1 billion Board authorization. This is not expected to have a material impact on fourth quarter EPS.","Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019.","We expect underlying identical sales growth in the fourth quarter will be similar to third quarter. However, incremental SNAP dollars that were in the market in January 2019 represent about a 50% -- 50 basis point -- excuse me, 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. We, therefore, anticipated reported ID sales will be towards the lower end of our 2019 guidance range for quarter four as we cycle the effect of SNAP.","We continue to expect the fourth quarter to deliver double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Where we land with our adjusted EPS annual guidance range will be heavily influenced by fuel margins in the fourth quarter, which were at record highs in quarter four last year. Our customers' shopping behaviors affected by the lower SNAP dollars in market in January will also influence the outcome.","As you know, we typically share annual guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in March. But this year, we provided guidance for 2020 several months early. We remain confident in the 2020 guidance that we shared last month at our Investor Day in New York.","And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.","William McMullen","Thanks, Gary. As I shared when we first began the call, we believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. We are on track with a stable and growing grocery business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued development of our seamless ecosystem. Our focus on the fundamentals generated positive results in our supermarket business in the third quarter, which gives us strong momentum heading into the holiday season.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","I just wanted to start with a question on the Q4 outlook. So you have a fairly wide range. That, I guess, implies earnings growth anywhere from sort of like mid-singles all the way up over 20%. One question, I think, that I have related to this is what are the puts and takes around that range? And I know you mentioned fuel, but a second question related to that is that to get to these numbers sort of either way, you need core grocery earnings to improve, and that's despite what is a harder comparison on SNAP and quite frankly recent pressure in grocery. So can you just kind of walk us through those puts and takes and then what you think will drive core grocery earnings to inflect positively in Q4?","Gary Millerchip","Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll cover that. So you're correct, we expect -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are expecting adjusted EPS growth to be in the double digits in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned a moment ago, we're assuming and expecting identical sales growth to be in the range in the quarter, continuing the sort of trend that we saw in Q3, but there will be some SNAP headwinds that will bring it down towards the lower end of the range. So that's the kind of core assumption around ID sales for the quarter.","We do cycle some investments. In Q4 last year, if you recall that we set up costs around some facilities in D.C. So from a gross margin perspective, we do have some tailwinds that will help the quarter. We also expect to continue to see the cost saving improvements that we've been accelerating throughout the year as we continue to execute on the $1 billion cost saving plan. And of course, I think we shared on previous quarters that alternative profit streams tends to be skewed more towards the fourth quarter, predominantly because both KPS has a heavy fourth quarter influence on the results and then Media continues to accelerate, and Q4 is always a higher Media quarter as well. So you combine an accelerating rate and the fact that Media is higher in the fourth quarter helps the alternative profit part of the business to continue to grow.","In terms of the sort of puts and takes in the quarter that could influence where we finish in the range, on the headwind side, obviously, we have been investing in a new brand launch, and we're obviously spending dollars there in continuing to improve the messaging and translating that into a connection with our customers. We also launched the promotion on free pickup for the quarter as well and seeing how that plays out in terms of customer behavior. And then, of course, we also have the fuel headwind in the fourth quarter where our rate was $0.34, which was a record high last year. So those would be the headwinds that we're pushing against versus the assumptions I mentioned earlier.","The unknowns around the range, really, with fuel being a record high in the fourth quarter last year, if fuel performs in line with where it's been on average for the year-to-date position, it would obviously be at a certain level. If it was -- which is a $0.29 to $0.30 range, if it was at the similar level as last year at $0.34, that makes a meaningful difference to how the quarter ends. And then, of course, seeing how customers behave as a result of the SNAP dollars not being in market in January is a further factor in really causing us to leave the range as wide as it is. But we do feel confident in the way we see the model in the fourth quarter, which is why we still believe double-digit growth in the earnings per share is what we'd expect to achieve.","Edward Kelly","And just a follow-up. It seems like what's new in terms of what we're learning in the guidance this quarter is it -- I guess it seems like there's a $0.03 pharmacy charge that's in the guidance given that it's in your $0.47. Your LIFO charge is going up by $0.04. So that seems to be something that's a bit more unexpected. What's offsetting that to allow you to maintain guidance?","William McMullen","Ed, this is Rodney. Just a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in. Obviously, our identicals continue to improve and strong there. If you look at gross margin without fuel and pharmacy, a slight improvement there. We had great balance between cost improvements and gross investment and it's the continuation of those pieces coming together. So it's really -- the core business continuing to improve and move in the right direction, that's providing the tailwind to offset the $0.03 on the pharmacy that was out-of-a-quarter adjustment and the LIFO as well. I don't know, Gary, anything?","Gary Millerchip","I would completely agree with you, Rodney. I think the key thing for us is that, to your point, that those headwinds, even with those headwinds, if you strip those back in the quarter and look at Q3, underlying EPS and operating profit would have been positive excluding the out-of-period adjustment, as Rodney mentioned. Obviously, ID sales was very positive during the quarter. But we mentioned on the call, we didn't include it in the press release, but the impact of the out-of-period on gross margin rate was 9 basis points. So actually, in the quarter, gross margin rate, even with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out, would have been balanced with OG&A improvements over 15. So we were 24 basis points reported gross margin decline, excluding fuel. Taking out those 9 basis points, you get to the 15 basis points of underlying, if you like, gross margin investment after the -- excluding the onetime -- sorry, the out-of-period adjustment.","So when we look at 15 basis points of investment, including pharmacy headwinds that we faced and we achieved 15 basis points of OG&A improvement, we actually feel like the progress that we're seeing in the model has been masked quite a bit in the quarter and we feel very positive about the underlying trends that we're seeing in the business.","Operator","The next question is from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","Maybe first, just following up on fuel. Can you help us with the benefit you're getting from improved sourcing and the sustainability of that relative to just kind of a general step higher in industry profitability and how that's playing out?","William McMullen","It's a combination of really some technology investments that we've made in terms of how to buy fuel and making sure, from a market standpoint, how we're pricing on a daily basis and reacting to what our competitors are doing. So it's the benefit of the way fuel is being bought plus being much more disciplined relative to the market. So it's really the combination of those.","In terms of expectations going forward, from a procurement standpoint, we don't believe that's something that will continue to incrementally get better. We do believe it's something that we'll be able to maintain, and it's something that we've reflected in our guidance going forward.","Judah Frommer","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the Lucky's write-down. I don't think it was that long ago that you guys were citing double-digit IDs at Lucky's and great trends in produce. Maybe just a little bit more on the decision to exit the investment, the write-down of the investment. And is there any commentary on that kind of subchannel of food retail, kind of the specialized fresh-led food retailers and smaller boxes that's causing you to say maybe the traditional larger store fresh-led format is the way to go?","William McMullen","Yes, it really gets back to Gary's comments in the prepared remarks is -- and we talked about at Investor Day, it's really reviewing our whole portfolio of things that we are involved with and working on. And it really -- the amount of investment that it would take for Lucky's to be a meaningful contributor to Kroger overall and the efforts that it would take, we just didn't think it created a good return for the investments that were needed to be made relative to that. So it was really driven by narrowing our focus and the additional requirements to make it something that would be meaningful to Kroger. I don't know, Gary, you've been more on a day-to-day basis involved, anything you want to add?","Gary Millerchip","I think you characterized it well, Rodney. I think the only thing maybe to build in the second part of the question, I -- we do believe that as we get better connecting on fresh and continue to evolve the strategy around natural and organic, obviously, we're providing a far more comprehensive level of experience for that customer than ever before and continue to do more of that as we continue to build out the strategy around freshness and connecting with our loyal customers.","We do believe that there's still a role for the small format store. I think it's certainly proven. And I think it's still probably to be proven in the industry about what is the right model for a smaller format store and how do you make that economic model work and how do you connect with the customer in a way that drives the right value on those smaller shopping trips as well. So we still believe and continue to look for opportunities. And obviously, our Walgreens pilot continues to provide an opportunity to learn how to continue to build a strategy that has a small format presence in there. But I do think it also demonstrates your comment that it's hard to figure out that small format model and to make it work effectively.","Operator","The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Cerankosky","Been looking at the Thanksgiving sales and how customers were spending, trading up. Can you talk about what that might mean for the Christmas selling season later this month?","William McMullen","Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at quarter-to-date, our identicals would be pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. The balancing of it is significantly different than the last few years because, obviously, there's one less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you look at the way how customers spend their money, we continue to see obviously strong on people trading up, strong performance in wine, cheese, all those types of categories, and we would certainly expect that to continue to stay consistent through Christmas as well. So we really expect the business to continue where it is through Christmas. Obviously, if you look at January of next year, it's really the SNAP cycling, the SNAP impact would affect the kind of the numbers that we've provided for guidance.","Charles Cerankosky","Related to customers trading up, is that what you're trying to do when you invest in the customer experience? Prepared food strikes me you're making investments there. But are there other things we should think about?","William McMullen","Yes. It's fascinating because the customer is trading up both in terms of buying bigger package size. So what we find is when people are tied on budgets, they go to smaller package size. So we see people trading up there. We see people trading up to products that's better for you, natural and organic category. Prepared foods would be an area that we see people continuing to trade up for, and it's an area where we've focused a lot of attention on how do we get better. We view it as a huge opportunity to improve from where we are. And it's one of those things where we're just at the beginning part of that journey but certainly see customers very willing to pick up dinner at Kroger but do it with a Home Chef meal or something already prepared.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Antonio Tabet","This is Antonio Tabet taking over for Mike Montani. I just wanted to ask something on the 4Q comp outlook. You guys are obviously cycling SNAP in January. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing so far now with the whole rebrand going on.","And another follow-up to that is with the option of free pickup promotion going on right now until January 1, is there a possibility that, that stays? Or what are you seeing from that so far from the reception of customers?","William McMullen","Yes. If you look at the outlook for the fourth quarter, so far in the quarter, we're tracking pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. So it's really up until the SNAP period, we really don't see changes there. In terms of the pickup, free pickup option, we really aren't to a point yet of deciding whether to continue it or not. As you know, we've done it in several markets, and we're still early in the analysis. We -- the customer adoption has been stronger -- a little bit stronger than what we were expecting. But it's -- we're still at a point where we don't need to decide that yet in terms of whether we extend it or not.","Gary Millerchip","Just to add, Rodney, so it is literally a few weeks obviously into -- since we announced the promotion. It's interesting. We're seeing a combination of new customers starting to use the service as well as existing loyal Kroger shoppers using the service more frequently as well. So we'll be using all of that data, as you might expect, to really analyze and evaluate. And that's certainly a factor that could also influence how the quarter plays out in terms of sales, which is another reason why we're trying to be clear about sharing the different moving parts that could still affect the quarter.","Antonio Tabet","Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the digital side. You guys grew digital sales 21% this quarter. And just the way we're thinking about it, for the full year, we're thinking somewhere in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion digital sales versus 2018 value somewhere around the baseline of $4 billion. So that implies around 31%, 30% year-over-year growth. Is that somewhat reasonable to think of? Or is that an attainable target? Just want to get your color on that.","William McMullen","Yes. If you look at it on a run rate basis, the numbers that you shared would be very consistent with what we see. The other thing I always think is important to remember that I mentioned on our digital business and Yael shared it on a graph is the profitability of that business is maturing as we expect. And if you look at the early adopters on digital, the profitability of that customer was the same as going in store because we get such a higher share of their total spend. And we continue to see that maturity happen as well, which, for us, is something that makes it a sustainable model longer term as well.","Gary Millerchip","Just one thing to add, Rodney, you said in your prepared comments and I mentioned it briefly as well, but I think we shared before that it really is the cycling of the Home Chef merger that caused the absolute percentage growth rate to show a declining trend. The underlying progress that we're seeing in customer engagement through Kroger pickup and delivery continues to be very strong and very consistent in the underlying results that we're seeing beyond the headline number.","Antonio Tabet","Okay. And does that headwind continue to 4Q?","Gary Millerchip","We've cycled that now. So it kind of -- it was partly through Q3, so you have kind of roughly half of it in the -- sorry, partly through Q2, so roughly half of it in the second quarter, and now it's fully cycled through in Q3. I think Yael may have shared, too, at the investor conference that we expect the growth year-over-year going into 2020 to be in that 20% range, consistent with what we shared this quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","Rodney, thank you for the update on the quarter-to-date comp. Can you -- I know you probably will say no, you've never done this before. But just given some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, could you give us an update on sort of where you stand on your core gross margin quarter-to-date and your fuel margin as well? The reason I'm asking is there does seem to be a little bit of hesitation from some investors on your ability to sort of hit the high end of your guidance range for the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.","William McMullen","Yes. I really would just go back to the comments that Gary made before. If you look at the underlying supermarket business, it continues to be strong. Identicals continue to be strong. A very good balance between cost reductions and investments in service and growth. The biggest swing would be the fuel margin. And even internally, the swings can be so much from day-to-day that it's really -- the value of where we are quarter-to-date, I don't think it can change overnight. And I remember the other day being in a market where in the morning, the margins were $0.40. In the afternoon, the margins were $0.15. It's that type of swing. But when you look at overall, it's a great return and it creates a lot of customer loyalty. And then the other piece is SNAP. So I don't know, Gary, if there's any additional insight. But to me, quarter-to-date, fuel margins are just kind of hard because it swings so much.","Gary Millerchip","Yes, I think that's right. And just to put the number into context, I mentioned it briefly earlier, but the rate that we've been trending at year-to-date in that $0.29-ish range, $0.34 was the Q4 rate last year. That $0.05 range can make a $50 million difference in terms of profitability. So -- and obviously, we have a very clear strategy of how we connect with customers on fuel and making sure that we're in line with the market. And so it is one of those areas where it can have a significant impact, and hence why I appreciate it does leave a much wider range than we normally want to, I think, have in place for the fourth quarter, and it's certainly not a lack of confidence in what we're seeing in the underlying core business, but it's just -- with that level of uncertainty out there on something like rates, it's -- we felt it was prudent to leave the range where it is.","Kenneth Goldman","I get that. And then my follow-up is, obviously, the government made some changes that are going to take some people in the America off food stamps, and it sounds like there's more of that coming. I'm curious, to what degree does your 2020 guidance factor that as a risk? Because, clearly, I think that if 700,000 or eventually some of the people think it will be closer to 3 million Americans get off food stamps, I can't say that as a positive for you, but I'm curious if there's any way to think about numerically how that might affect you?","Gary Millerchip","Yes. Thanks for the question. Ken, obviously, it's something that we continue to watch very closely. And obviously, it's one of those things that we knew was a potential risk that's out there in the business, and we'll continue to watch it and evaluate. From our perspective, we really try and build the business model around being able to adapt to the circumstances, and we do believe that the model that we're creating and our ability to connect with customers and deliver an overall experience, the personalized pricing offers that we can generate that obviously are -- what we tend to see when customers have less dollars, they'll tend to gravitate more to own brand products, and you'll start to see some behavior shift. But because food is a nondiscretionary spend, usually, the customer is going to make adaptations that they have to, to be able to still buy the groceries that feed the family.","So from our perspective, it's certainly something that we contemplate as a risk as we think through how we'll continue to build our model and drive connection with customers. And it's something that we'll continue to adapt as we hear more and learn when and if the changes occur. But obviously, it's one of those things out of our control. And our focus is much more on how do we make sure we win the customer and continue to adapt strategy if some of those things were to hit us as a headwind in 2020.","William McMullen","Yes. Just a couple of additions. Obviously, the overall economy continues to be strong as well, which provides support. And when you look at SNAP, we would be less dependent on SNAP than many of our competitors would be as well.","Operator","The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.","Erica Eiler","This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Firstly, just wanted to touch on price investments. I think last quarter, you called out, I think it was about 12 basis points of price investment. Just curious if there was a similar level of price investments this quarter.","Gary Millerchip","Yes. I don't think we've typically called out specifically price investments. What I would say in terms of maybe a couple of thoughts, when you think about gross margin and what happened in gross margin during the quarter, the way that -- to sort of break it down, if you like, and I covered a couple of these points earlier, but if you exclude fuel from the results, we had a 24 basis point investment in gross margin, 9 basis points of that related to the out-of-period charge that we shared in the press release this morning, which essentially brings it down to 15 basis points. All of that gross margin headwind was essentially in the health and wellness space between Kroger specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. And as Rodney mentioned, our gross margin rate overall improved slightly when you exclude pharmacy from the core business.","So another way to say that is through the cost of goods savings that we were able to execute on during the quarter and the alternative profit growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter, which both support improvements in gross margin, we fully offset the continued price investments that we made in the business to drive the continued improvement in ID sales growth.","We are continuing to invest in price. As we've shared, I think, at the Investor Day, a lot of our focus this year is on really making sure that we're using our data to drive the price investments in areas that matter most to our customers. And some of those are going to be personalized offers and promotions, but some of it will also be in fuel rewards. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that while the profitability of fuel improved during the quarter, that was offsetting the supermarket business by an 8% growth in the amount of fuel rewards that we paid to customers to incentivize them to continue buying Kroger.","So it's a complex model in that sense, but we are continuing to invest in price. We're pleased with the way that customers are reacting to the investments that we're making because it's certainly allowing us as that one component of driving the identical sales growth that we shared in the quarter. But we're being very deliberate in balancing those investments with cost of goods savings and alternative profit growth.","William McMullen","Yes. The other thing that helped gross -- our shrink improved for the ninth consecutive quarter and warehousing and transportation costs improved as well.","Erica Eiler","Okay. That's helpful. And then you briefly mentioned the prepared food opportunity. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about your vision behind the recently announced ClusterTruck partnership? And does this at all impact how you're thinking about Home Chef?","William McMullen","I'll start with the end of your question first. It doesn't affect us how we look at Home Chef at all. And if you think about our overall strategy on trying to serve the customer anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want, as you know, about half of food is food already prepared where people spend their money. And our market share there is significantly less than on the traditional supermarket business. And we really view that it will be a combination of Home Chef, something physical in stores in terms of meals ready to heat, ready to eat. And ClusterTruck is one of those where we think it's an addition to that overall ecosystem. Obviously, they have incredibly good technology. It's made to order quickly. And they will be able to leverage -- and we're doing -- it's obviously on a test basis, they'll be able to leverage some of our physical assets to be able to scale as well.","So it's really an additional piece in terms of how do we get the customers what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. And it's just an overall part of the overall ecosystem. And we just see the opportunity on food that's already prepared is a massive opportunity.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","So you said you've been encouraged by some of the early learnings from your expansion of the free digital pickup initiative. Can you give us a sense for how that initiative has impacted the P&L? So is the financial performance in line with what you expected?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks for the question. Just recall, again, it is really early days in the journey with the promotion because we literally launched it a few weeks ago. And obviously, part of the modeling that you would expect us to do as we understand customer behavior is to look at -- as Kroger does on everything that we do, look at the longitudinal behavior with the customer and not just the individual transaction but how does that change the level of engagement with the customer, and that's going to need to happen over a longer period of time, as Rodney mentioned earlier.","Certainly, the early encouraging signs are, as I mentioned, we're starting to see new customers experience the service and start to engage in Kroger pickup that haven't before. We're also seeing existing Kroger pickup customers start to increase the frequency with which they use pickup service. And so a lot of the financial modeling that we will do will really be looking at those metrics over a longer period of time and saying, how does that play out in terms of the value it creates and how does it drive loyalty. And then, of course, as we talked a little bit about at the investor conference, we'll look at that in the context of the investments that we're making in the business and how does customer value this part of the experience versus other ways in which we're creating value across price investments, across fuel discounts and obviously through the experience that we're offering in the store.","So it's a pretty complex area. And certainly, we'll look at it over a longer period of time. We're seeing kind of the type of behavior we have expected to see, and it's certainly been positive. But it's really going to be a longer period of time before we could really evaluate the way in which it impacts the model with the customer.","Michael Lasser","And just to clarify, Gary, you have assumed that in your 2020 guidance that you've provided, the test will be limited to 2019 so it will not continue into 2020 at this point. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Gary Millerchip","We haven't really gotten into specifics around what our pricing strategy will be in 2020. As we talked about, obviously, I would think about it more much as you think back to the chart that I shared at the investor meeting in New York and how we're balancing the investments that we're making in the cost savings in the business. So we certainly have a clear view of how much we believe we want to invest in the business next year and how that will be supported by the $1 billion of cost savings that we're expecting. So if we were going to see the value in pickup driving more value in our model, it would be because either we expect it to drive higher sales and support the investment or we believe it would be a better way to invest the dollars that we think are important to driving value for the customer in 2020.","Michael Lasser","That's helpful. My follow-up question is, Rodney, you've seen some pretty good momentum in your ID sales. There's probably a variety of factors that are contributing to that, including a healthier overall environment, being further away from some of the disruptive changes that you've made and better execution in the business. If you had to rank those factors and maybe any others in order of importance and magnitude that they've contributed to driving this improvement, how would you do that?","William McMullen","Yes. Great question, Michael. We would really view those as pretty equal. The other thing that we would add on top of that is really using personalization and data to be more specific for each customer individually. So like on -- the example I gave on fuel rewards, but it would be true for offers more than just fuel rewards, but really personalizing it to each household individually. And it's really all of those -- we would call it, the sum of all parts. It's all of that together that's creating and improving the momentum. It's not just one single thing.","Operator","The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Kamboj","This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon. So sales trends are improving and the grocery gross margin increased slightly in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that combination is in the near term? And then more broadly, what changes in the competitive landscape would you need to see to undergo a deeper round of price investments over the next three years than what's currently embedded in your plan?","Gary Millerchip","Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part of the question, I would kind of draw back again to what we talked about at the investor conference. The way we think about the model going forward is, certainly, we're going to continue to invest in price. We're going to continue to invest in the customer experience because the long-term sustainable growth in loyalty, we think that's critical to our plan. What we're doing very deliberately is being very disciplined in how we're managing costs within the business, both cost of goods savings but also OG&A cost efficiency, which obviously was strong during the quarter. And then alternative profit streams continues to accelerate and obviously offset the gross margin investments that we're making as well.","So I think we look at it much more of an overall ecosystem, if you like, is how do we use food as the foundation for customer loyalty, which drives the traffic. And then fuel obviously builds on that in terms of causing customers to shop more frequently. And then you think about the health and wellness business and alternative profit streams layering on together to create this overall ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and drives total profitability of the customer. And the way we think about it is how do we pull those levers together in a way that allows us to continue to invest and build loyalty. And we're using the different dynamics there around alternative profit and cost savings to be able to continue to invest.","I think when we look at the market, certainly, obviously, there's always high competition. We expect that to continue. We always assume that within our model. And we feel very good about the plans that we're implementing around driving costs out and continue to grow alternative profit that we can make the investments that we need to, to be able to continue to grow customer loyalty.","William McMullen","Yes. I'd only add a couple of things. One, and Gary briefly mentioned it, if you look at continuing to learn to improve the customer experience, that provides support and ongoing support because we still -- we've made good progress, but we still see opportunities to get better.","The one area that I've been pleasantly surprised, as you know, we've been able to -- in 2018, we were able to take over $1 billion of costs out. We're on track to exceed that again incrementally in 2019, and we have plans to do that in 2020 as well. We continue to see good opportunity to take costs out. And when you look at all those -- both those pieces together and the free cash flow of the business is what gives us confidence and comfort in the comment that Gary shared at the investor meeting of TSR of 8% to 11% per year.","Joshua Kamboj","That's helpful. And then in general, maybe you could just quickly touch on your price gaps versus some of your key competitors. Have they been widening or narrowing? And are you pretty happy with where they sit at the moment?","William McMullen","Yes. One of the things that we always think it's important, we're comfortable where we are, but it's always important to remember that customers decide where to shop based on freshness of departments, and we shared with you that our customer feedback on fresh is better than our big box competitors. We also have tons of personalized offers where a customer gets value, both in terms of individual mailings, individual e-mails and fuel. So it's all of those pieces together, and we feel good about where we -- our gap is.","Operator","And the last question will be from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert Ohmes","Just two follow-ups. Just the first on the LIFO increase, can you maybe just -- you mentioned procuring better, but LIFO is coming in higher than expected. I think in the press release, you guys called out grocery and dairy inflation. Is this all commodity driven? Or are CPG companies pushing through price increases? And then also, could you tell us what the inflation component of IDs was to the third quarter? So maybe just paint us a picture of what exactly is going on between all those things.","Gary Millerchip","Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes, it's an interesting question around LIFO and inflation because -- I'll maybe answer the two questions slightly differently. From an inflation point of view, as you know, we've shared before, we were assuming inflation in the range of 0% to 1% in the year. I would say it's trending slightly above that range. Actually, for Q3, I wouldn't say it's materially different than it was in Q2. There are a couple of categories like produce went slightly down and meat went slightly up, but nothing that would have been dramatic in terms of the overall change in inflation. So just slightly ahead of that 1% assumption that we had during the year. And actually, even though our LIFO charge forecasted increasing, we haven't really seen a dramatic change in the overall inflation rate across the categories. Everything I just said now I should probably caveat excludes fuel and pharmacy because those two obviously tend to have a different trajectory versus most of the food categories.","Interesting -- with LIFO, it is a one data point in time at the end of the year that we follow to support the accounting rules that are in place around making that LIFO adjustment. With the data point that we used in the third quarter caused us to, in following that process, believe that we should increase the rate and based on what it's telling us, that's why we called out the forecast is expected to be a headwind for the year. Of course, it's a noncash item, and it doesn't really impact the underlying performance of the business. But it will impact the earnings for the year based on the trend that we're seeing right now. But I wouldn't say it's a reflection of a major change in what we're seeing in inflation.","And obviously, we've shared before, when we see price increases, generally speaking, we'll be pushing back on them based on our knowledge of our own brand products and managing those. But where we are seeing them, we're generally looking to pass them on to the customer where it makes sense in those markets.","Robert Ohmes","And just my other follow-up question. Just on fuel rewards, so you're expecting the CPG profitability of fuel kind of -- it sounds like flatten out next year. But it sounds like you're also going to be pushing harder, if I understood it, to kind of drive IDs more using the fuel rewards program. Just how should we think about that? And has there been a change in the responsiveness to fuel rewards that's got you interested in pulling that lever a little harder to drive IDs and penetrate loyalty more?","William McMullen","Yes. It really is an important part of our overall connection rewards on -- back to our customers for them shopping with us. I would say part of it is just continuing to learn new approaches that connect with the customer. So over the last, really, 6 to 12 months, we've been doing a lot of different types of tests and learns, trying to identify additional approaches that connect well with the customer. And it's really some of those are working, so we continue to scale that. How much we scale will really be driven by the degree of customer connection and how much does it drive the business. But customers still love an incredible great value for fuel. And we have so many convenient fuel locations. It really works out well for our customers and for our business as well.","Robert Ohmes","And just, Rodney, how should we think about -- if you do keep growing it at 8% year-over-year, how will you fund that in 2020 if you're not going to be growing the profitability of your fuel business at the same rate?","William McMullen","Yes. Well, when we talk about fuel cents per gallon, we do not reduce that for any rewards at all. That doesn't show up there in terms of our internal financials. If you look at the overall guidance that we gave for 2020, we would be reflecting what we expect and plan to do on fuel rewards. But it really gets back to Gary's comment in terms of by -- improving identicals by this much, these type of process changes and getting costs out, what type of capacity does that give us to invest in service and price. And we would look at fuel rewards as part of that price investment because that's how our customers look at it.","Thanks, Robbie. We really appreciate everybody joining us today. And as always, thank you for your questions. Hopefully, you can get the sense from Gary and my comments that our underlying business results continue to be strong. Identicals continue to move in the right direction. We had good balance on investing in growth and cost improvements, and the free cash flow of the business continued to be strong, which positions us to get into a position of being able to buy stock back as well. So when you look at it overall in the quarter, feel very good about the underlying results and where we're headed.","As you know, before I end today's call, I always like to share a few final comments that's directed at our associates and how we live our purpose every day. Last week, I was visiting with store associates in our Collierville Kroger in Memphis. And a customer approached me when I was walking into the store, and he just wanted to share why he shops at Kroger. And he said -- first of all, I gave an example where one of our associates just gave incredible customer service. And then he said, \"Krogers, you always are great at donating food and funds to serve hungry families in our communities.\" And he specifically talked about his community. And to me, that reminded me of the privilege that we all have, to serve our customers and communities and each other, whether it's generously giving back to our neighbors in need or by being there for our more than 11 million customers that come into our stores and online every day, especially during this busy holiday season.","We open our doors and welcome everyone in as guests, whether they shop with us all the time or it's their first time shopping with us. Each celebration or tradition is unique, and we can be there for our customers when they need us most. Because we believe no matter who you are, how you like to shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy, fresh food. Each of us, all 460,000 associates, play an incredibly important role in bringing fresh for everyone to life. From stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, thank you for all you do every day and especially during this busy holiday season. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, merry Christmas and a happy new year.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Fab, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed.","Cindy Holmes","Thank you, Fab. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We're very pleased with Kroger's excellent first quarter results. We achieved strong overall sales and solid operating performance. Our core business is growing, and we are rewarding shareholders through earnings growth, increasing dividends over time and stock buybacks.","Identical supermarket sales were up for the 34th consecutive quarter, growing by 4.2%. We are able to deliver this kind of consistent performance quarter-after-quarter, thanks to our associates' commitment to our Customer 1st strategy.","Here are a few highlights. Every supermarket department had positive identical sales, led by significant growth in natural food, pharmacy, bakery and deli. Every supermarket division had positive identical sales. Kroger's FIFO operating profit dollars grew, both with and without fuel, and it is our expectation to slightly increase our FIFO operating margin rate excluding fuel for the year.","As a result of these strong results, we exceeded our expectations and, as a result, raised our earnings per share guidance for the year. Mike will provide detail on our full year guidance, as well as some other items that factored into earnings growth for the quarter shortly.","So before I turn it to Rodney and Mike, I'd like to spend a little time discussing a question that came up during last earnings call. The essence of the question was how is Kroger growing market share and performing well, especially compared to traditional competitors? How are we different?","Several years ago, we took a hard look at who we were really competing against, and that helped us realize we're competing against more than just traditional grocery retailers. Also, based on our research and our identical sales, we were not connecting with customers as well as we needed. In fact, customers told us we weren't doing a very good job. Their needs were changing, but we had not changed with them.","These realities led us to develop our Customer 1st strategy and the 4 keys: people, products, shopping experience and price. We've pushed hard to save money in places not important to customers and to reinvest -- invest it in places that are important to them. This is the essence of the Kroger difference: solving needs for our customers, sometimes in massive ways and sometimes in a very targeted, personal way.","Customers tell us they notice the difference. I believe this difference is why -- that we've had 34 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales. Identical sales are the most visible indicator available of a retailer's relevancy to its customers. I want to repeat that, it's very important. Identical sales are the most visible indicator available of a retailer's relevancy to its customers. That's why we pay such close attention to the identical sales trend.","As we've grown our market share, some of you have also asked who is Kroger gaining from? But since we're targeting customers and not other retailers, there isn't always a clear answer. One thing that is clear, as we've grown market share, our customers come from a much broader base than just supermarkets. It is also clear that we compete very well with a broader array of food retailers, and this includes restaurants.","We thought this background would be helpful to put in context our strong results and to project that at Kroger, we have and will continue to separate ourselves from our traditional competitors. In fact, we are creating a new industry.","Rodney will now share some additional insight into Kroger's positive business trends in the first quarter. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave talked about how we have differentiated ourselves. One example of this is the joint venture we formed to create the consumer insight giant dunnhumbyUSA. Years of experience with dunnhumby have made us exponentially better at personalization and individual rewards. By deepening our focus on our customers, we have redefined our business model. It is more sustainable today than it was 5, 10 or 15 years ago.","We also leverage our partnership with dunnhumby to better understand shopper behavior over time. In the first quarter, Kroger increased the total number of loyal households. Those households are making more visits. And while they are buying fewer items per trip, the total units we sell to our loyal customers have increased.","We regularly seek customer feedback on how well we are executing in each of the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st strategy. Our customers tell us we've improved performance in each key. This improvement is consistent across all the keys, and we are 60% of the way towards the goals we originally set.","We are happy with where we are, and we are a different retailer as a result. But there is offside to this. We still have more work to do, which is also very exciting.","Product cost inflation continued in the first quarter. However, the rate of inflation is decreasing faster than what we expected at the beginning of this year. Identical store sales growth exceeded the rate of inflation, which we estimate was 3.9% excluding fuel. Deflation in the produce department offset somewhat the inflation in all other departments, including grocery, meat and bakery.","Total tonnage change was slightly better than the fourth quarter. However, it was still essentially flat. Looking at one department with deflation, produce, we saw a significant growth in tonnage for the quarter.","Kroger's corporate brand share and sales grew more than national brands in the first quarter. Corporate brands represented approximately 26% of grocery department sales dollars. Grocery department units sold are up 60 basis points to 33.6% compared to the same quarter last year.","Our corporate brands team continues to create fresh and compelling products that fill unmet customer needs. We recently launched Private Selection's Snack Chips in 13 new flavors, including sea salt, cinnamon sugar and a new gluten-free rice and bean chip made from rice and azuki beans. And by the way, they're all very good.","Finally, an update on labor relations. Our associates at King Soopers ratified a 2-year extension to the labor contract. We also secured a new labor agreement covering associates at our Smith's and Food 4 Less stores in Las Vegas. We have many contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Columbus, Dayton, Indianapolis, Louisville, Memphis, Nashville and Portland. Our objective at every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages; a quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates.","Next, Mike will share additional detail on Kroger's first quarter financial results and guidance for 2012. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our identical supermarket sales increased 4.2% in the first quarter, which contributed to net earnings totaling $439.4 million compared to $432.3 million in the same period last year.","Net earnings per diluted share showed strong growth to $0.78 from $0.70 per diluted share last year. Our earnings per share growth was driven by EBITDA being higher than our expectations. Additionally, a tax reserve adjustment helped by about $0.015. FIFO gross margin was 20.7% of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 53 basis points from the same period last year.","We are pleased with this performance, which was consistent with our plan for the quarter. Last year, we saw a very strong gross margin in the first quarter. Kroger recorded a $46 million LIFO charge during the first quarters of both 2012 and 2011.","Operating, general and administrative costs were 15.36% of sales. Excluding retail fuel operations, OG&A declined 27 basis points from the same period last year. Including rent depreciation, it was a 40-basis-point reduction. The benefits of leverage from productivity improvements, outstanding cost control and positive sales more than offset rising health care costs and credit card fees. Additionally, the consolidation of 4 UFCW pension plans in the prior year benefited operating expenses in the first quarter as we anticipated.","Identifying and delivering sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest at all 4 keys of our Customer 1st strategy consistently over time. The company's FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, on a rolling 4-quarters basis decreased 11 basis points. This was a little better than we expected due to the higher EBITDA versus our original expectation that I mentioned a moment ago. We still expect FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, to slightly increase for the full year of 2012. Additionally, we generated more operating margin profit dollars this year compared to last year.","Turning now to Kroger's retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers and convenience stores produced positive identical gallon growth. These outlets earned approximately $0.121 per gallon compared to $0.124 in the same quarter last year. The benefit to earnings per share was the same as last year.","Now I'll update you on our financial strategy. During fiscal 2012, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain its current debt rating. Kroger repurchased 14.6 million common shares for a total investment of $345.3 million in the first quarter. The Board of Directors have authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program that replaces the prior authorization which was exhausted on June 12, 2012, just a couple of days ago. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used its strong free cash flow to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.","Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $539.1 million for the first quarter compared with $573.1 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range.","Net total debt was $7.8 billion, an increase of $662.1 million from a year ago. This is primarily the result of debt issued to fund our UFCW pension plan consolidation. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.91 compared with 1.79 during the same period last year.","In March, we told you that we expect the external environment to be a little better in 2011. Generally speaking, this has been our experience through the first quarter. We continue to monitor changes in gas prices and inflation. And as the headlines continually remind us, macroeconomic issues will continue to affect consumer sentiment throughout the year. We are confident in our ability to make tactical adjustments as needed to successfully navigate these factors while continuing to deliver on our Customer 1st strategy.","Kroger's long-term business model is to generate earnings -- annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2% for its shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. We expect this total return to compare favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon.","We continue to expect fiscal 2012 earnings per share growth to be higher than our long-term business model, and our strong first quarter positions Kroger's for an even more robust 2012 than originally expected. Therefore, we've increased our earnings guidance for the first year to -- for the fiscal year to $2.33 to $2.40 per diluted share. The original guidance was $2.28 to $2.38 per share. The increase reflects the strength of the company's first quarter results.","I'd like to share a little bit more about pharmacy's better-than-expected performance, which helped sales as well as earnings in the first quarter. Pharmacy achieved double-digit identical sales, about half due to new Express Scripts business and half from exceptional overall pharmacy performance. Even without Express Scripts, it was an excellent quarter for our pharmacies.","Our ability to project pharmacy performance over the course of the year remains difficult when factoring in the benefit of Express Scripts and prescription drugs coming off patent. This quarter was good, and we were -- and we think we are satisfying new customers who transferred because of Express Scripts.","We continue to expect identical sales to trend down throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as prescription drugs come off patents. For these reasons, we continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 3% to 3.5%.","As we said at year end, we expect second -- the second quarter growth rate to be in line with our long-term growth rate of 6% to 8%, and the third and fourth quarters will be higher than that. The fourth quarter will also benefit from the 53rd week.","Now I will turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Mike. This was another great quarter. We exceeded our expectations and, as a result, raised our earnings per share guidance for the year. Kroger's performance this quarter, like the 33 quarters of positive identical sales that preceded it, was the result of our focus on our customers. We're building relevant and personal connections with each customer, and that requires fresh new ways of thinking about our markets and our competition. That customers tell us we have significantly improved in the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st strategy, lets us know that we are not the same company today that we were even 7 years ago. We have differentiated ourselves from traditional food retailers and expect to drive loyalty, cash flow and earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.","We now look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So a couple of things, guys. When you look at your expectation for comps through the remainder of the year, what do you think happens to tonnage from where we are right now? Do you think we see any improvement? And it looks, by the work we've done, that competitive rationality continues to prevail. People aren't doing anything dumb at this point. Do you see the same thing? And would you expect that to continue?","David B. Dillon","On the tonnage for the year, we've said, I think all along, that as inflation comes down, which is what we expect to have happen, that, that -- while that's not negative, that doesn't mean prices are going to go down. It just means the rate of growth would slow. But we do think that, that will, in the long run, be positive for tonnage. However, tonnage will be slower to recover than the rate of inflation will come down, I believe. That's a personal opinion. We don't have any way to prove that till we actually go through it. And the reason I think that is because the economy, from a shopper's point of view, is not in all that great a shape. So it's not going to cause customers to jump back on the wagon unless they've got more money to spend. But we do expect it to positively affect tonnage, just at a slower rate, that's all. As for competition, we would agree with you. It's been a rational market. I think everyone realizes it's a tough market out there for customers, and I don't see a lot of overreacting going on. Rodney, you want to add any color to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No. No.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Secondly then, if you think about deployment of your cash flow, arguably, you're in the best position you've been in, in a very long time competitively. Stock is as cheap as it's been in 10 years. So how do you think about 2 things: one, being more aggressive with your buyback effort to the point of possibly levering up a little bit to do that? And secondly, how do you think about the dividend payout ratio? I know you have a target in terms of yield, but where do you think you ought to be in terms of payout?","David B. Dillon","I'll have Mike answer both of those in detail here in a second, but I will tell you that part of the answer you can find in the fact that our board authorized stock repurchase to start back up again as we finished that earlier this week. And that was intentional because, we agree with you, our stock prices is cheap. So Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. Relative to the buyback, we finished the quarter at 1.91x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We think being in the 2 to 2.2x range is something that the rating agencies would be comfortable with and allow us to continue to be a BBB flat credit which is important to us. It's not saying I want to be a 2.2x because you do like to have a little cushion, operating cushion and not live life on the edge necessarily. And over the last 4 quarters, we've returned $1.6 billion between buybacks and dividends. I think that's a pretty healthy return back to our shareholders. And relative to the dividend payout ratio, this will be our seventh year of paying a dividend since we've reinstituted it, and we've increased it every year. And we said at the outset and we continue to say, our plan would be to: once you start a dividend, you want to maintain it and not have to stop it and continue to grow it over time.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of categories, I thought it was very interesting. You talked about every supermarket had positive identical sales led by growth in natural foods, pharmacy, bakery and deli. I was wondering if you could provide some more color around those particular categories.","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, obviously, the pharmacy department, as Mike mentioned, was benefited from Express Scripts. But even without Express Scripts, pharmacy had a very strong identical sales growth. And the team, when they put together a plan on addressing -- getting the identical -- the additional Express Scripts business, really did a nice job of making it broader than just trying to get that business. And they've done a very nice job. Obviously, in natural foods, it's a trend change or a continued trend of people eating more organic and natural foods. And as we do a better and better job in that area, we're able to -- for a customer to eliminate one extra shop, and they can get those items from us at a price point that's very reasonable. On produce -- well, in deli, bakery, we've had strong results there for a while. Produce is kind of interesting. They had fabulous tonnage growth. The identical sales weren't so -- it was positive, but not so much, but the tonnage was just outstanding.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, Dave, you had talked about this idea of kind of creating a new industry, and I know that when your peers talk about your performance -- I mean, they really do stand in awe. I mean, as you look into the future, and I know that Kroger is always on the cutting-edge of technology, what do you think continues to differentiate Kroger from the pack?","David B. Dillon","Well, I really think it's the way in which we've looked at the business, and that was the point of the opening comments that I had, is that in the past, if you go back 15 years ago, we kept thinking like a traditional grocer. And we kept thinking that our competitors were traditional grocers, and we kept thinking about where you get customers is by competing with traditional grocers. The difference for us has been by focusing on customers, we're defining the industry we're in by how the customers think of it, not how we previously thought about it. So as an example, we used to think about it as people who buy food in supermarkets. But today, they buy food everywhere. They go to the club stores, the dollar stores, the mass retailers. They go to lots of places that are not supermarkets. And in fact, if you were to list our top competitors based on market share of the markets we operate in, the top 2 or 3 would not be traditional supermarkets, aside from us. And as a result, we don't really see that to be the universe that we're operating in. We see it as totally different, and we've had to approach it differently. And I think that, that's the reason we've had better results, because we're swimming in a pool that's bigger -- we were thinking about it as bigger -- than simply what the market was for traditional retailers. It's almost a classic business school case study, to show how you define your market and how you think of yourself will often determine who you become. And I think that's very true for us.","W. Rodney McMullen","Dave, the only other thing I would add, Deborah, to your question, one of the things that we've really been working on hard, and this has really been over the last several years, is not having a strategy that's only dependent on one competitive advantage. And if you look behind the strategy, there's really 10 or 12 different critical pieces. We often obviously talk about dunnhumby, and that would be one of the piece. But that isn't the only piece. And we believe over time that creates a bigger and bigger competitive advantage because the competitor can try to get as good on one particular part, but to do all the pieces is a lot harder. And that's really -- when Dave talks about creating a new industry, that's one of the things that -- we don't know quite what words to use other than we know it's a new industry, because there's really not anybody else competing on such a broad level of experiences. Obviously, technology is one piece of that, too.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wondering if you -- a 16-week quarter, just wondered if you could shed some light on how your ID trended throughout the period? And if you could, how things are going in the first few weeks here of the second quarter?","David B. Dillon","Well, let me answer the second part first and then I'll let Mike give you a little color on the trend and how we see it. Currently, for the quarter that we're in now -- and we're only, what, 3.5 weeks, I guess, into it -- we're down slightly from where we ran in the first quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into that because we have seen in the last -- well, even in the last year really, higher volatility between weeks than what we had been -- customers experiencing maybe years back. And as a result, it would be real easy to over-read a number like that. But after just 3.5 weeks, that's really not enough to read. But it is slightly down. In addition to that, we're seeing clearly the effect of the generics that we talked about in pharmacy. That is some of the brand name prescription items that are going to generic, which brings the price down very quickly. And you can see it literally by week. In fact, I'm looking right now at a graph that shows by week the way in which these are coming off of patent and how it changes our sales. So that makes a really big difference. And I probably ought to add, someone in here reminded me to make sure I emphasize the point, is that when I say we're down slightly, I'm saying down from the 4.2%. We're not negative at all. We're still quite positive. We're still quite positive and quite pleased with where we are in sales. I wanted to make sure that got clarified. Thank you.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the trend during the quarter?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, it's kind of hard to answer the trend during the quarter, to break it down into distinct 4-week periods, primarily because holidays shifted between some of those periods this year. But when you kind of lap over those kinds of issues, it was relatively consistent. Obviously, when we've reported March, we said we were close to the fourth quarter numbers. So it trended down a little bit throughout the quarter, but that's kind of consistent with what Dave talked about. As prescription drugs come off generics, that's kind of the trend we expected. So relatively stable, a little bit of noise. Clearly first of the month, end of the month kind of phenomenas. But overall, fairly consistent throughout the quarter.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just my follow-up, Mike, for you, is your core FIFO gross profit margin compares get real easy here over the next few quarters. Can you hold our hand on how we should think about that line item over the next 3 periods? I know you're saying total EBIT core, you expect to be slightly up. But how should we think about the components of FIFO, GPM and SG&A?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I won't give guidance on the specific lines. Obviously, the rolling 4 quarters is down 11 basis points at the end of the first quarter, and our guidance is for that to be slightly better at the operating profit line. So that means we need to make up the 11, plus a little bit throughout the rest of the year. And to your point, the first quarter was our toughest compare quarter. A significant amount of the EBITDA we generated last year over 2010 was generated in the first quarter last year. And that's why we're comfortable that we can continue to slightly expand that by the end of the year. And the 11 basis points down did not alarm us. In fact, it was better than we had expected because of the stronger EBITDA in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ed Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","My question for you is on the ID guidance. You had mentioned on the call that inflation is decreasing or decelerating at a faster rate than you thought. So what have you embedded in the guidance, the ID guidance for the rest of the year on that? And since it's unchanged but there's less inflation, does that mean that you changed your outlook for the way that you think tonnage is going to play out the rest of the year?","J. Michael Schlotman","I don't know that we would change the way we think tonnage is going to play out. We ended the first quarter at just under 4% inflation. If you look inside the grocery category, which is half of our sales, it actually got lower every 4-week period, the way we measure it internally. So clearly, there's a decline going on at a pretty ratable measure throughout the year. If you look at where we think it might be at the end of the year, we're guessing under 3%, 2% to 3%. And when I talk about lower, I mean lower inflation, not lower tonnage. We would actually expect some tonnage increase as we go throughout the year. And Rodney's illustration in commodities like produce that are very price-sensitive, and lower prices means a great crop that eats very well, we saw extraordinary tonnage growth in produce in the first quarter. So we would expect tonnage to get a little better throughout the year and inflation continue to trend down a little bit.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just say we talk about an environment where maybe inflation in the back half of the year is -- let's just say it's not 2% to 3%. Let's say it's something lower than that. And for you guys, it's fine that your ID goes from 5% to 3% or 2.5% or whatever it might be, provided it's still a good number and that's not really in your control. But you've got this pretty big gap with your competitors. And under that environment, it means that their sales maybe turn negative. And what does that mean from a promotional standpoint, I guess, number one? And then if inflation's a little bit lighter, how do you manage your business if that ID, let's just say, ends the year at less than 3%?","J. Michael Schlotman","I think at the end of the day, it depends how you wind up getting to the 3%. I can't speak to how a competitor may manage their business. We spend enough time trying to figure out how to manage our own, let alone worrying about how others are going to manage theirs. Obviously we think about things, would they get promotional or do something hotter if there's negative ID sales. But at the end of the day, the important component is the tonnage. And when you look at some of the things that are elastic, that have elasticity of demand inside the grocery department, things like milk, milk prices continue to trend down. And the reported ID sales, to the extent that the generics coming off of patent affect that, that actually has a higher gross profit rate. So I think if -- stepping back and looking at your business overall, is tonnage moving in the right direction? What are your ID sales trends doing, unaffected by prescriptions coming off patent? And understanding all that, I think it's manageable for us. We don't foresee deflation by the end of the year. We foresee a little bit less inflation. That doesn't mean -- which doesn't mean lower prices. It probably means stable shelf prices or slightly up shelf prices.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And just lastly for you, can you maybe give us an update on the state of the consumer as you see it now? I mean, obviously, volumes across the industry have been fairly weak. Are customers just kind of getting by with buying less? Is there differences in income brackets? Just your sense as to really what you're seeing at the customer level.","David B. Dillon","Well, what's going on with the customers today is much like what we described in March. We're seeing those whose life and economic status is strong. Feeling and acting a little bit like they're -- that the recession is over or, certainly, that the economy has improved. We're seeing those who are on tight budgets and those who are more price-sensitive. Their behavior is being affected more by the economy. And I think overriding all of that is the fact that if you look at just generally the geopolitical world right now, people are a little bit nervous. And so there's a little bit of anxiety out there on the whole that kind of dampens their enthusiasm, even for those that are on the high end. That's how I would read it. Rodney, you want to add any more?","W. Rodney McMullen","I mean, I think overall, it would be pretty similar to what we said at the first year end. We continue to see it getting a little better but boy, it is very slow and bumpy from week to week.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It's our understanding that the price investments you made in California recently were successful. So 2 questions. First, is that the correct assessment, that you got the tonnage response you wanted? And second, if so, based on that success, to what extent might we expect maybe an accelerated investment in other banners down the road?","David B. Dillon","Well, I'll let Rodney answer the particulars, but let me just remind you that what we've said about price investments for actually many years now is that it's a long fuse. It's not the kind of thing that you invest one day and the next day you declare victory. You invest one day, and the next year, you decide whether or not it was a really good move or not, and you make adjustments maybe week-to-week and month-to-month. But it's not something that you can read that quickly. So Rodney, you want to give any color to this?","W. Rodney McMullen","Just a couple of comments. Our team at Ralphs and our -- have really done a very nice job of explaining to the customer the changes we made and the total value that we're offering versus before. So we really think it's our associates that have done a nice job of communicating the value to the customer, is the reason the customers are reacting in a positive way. Some of the things that we did at Ralphs were things that we'd already done in other parts of the country earlier. So it's really just from -- some of it was just from a timing standpoint that we now had the resources to do it at Ralphs. So overall, pleased with where we are. Probably be about all the comments I'd make.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just to follow up on a point you made earlier, you talked about one of the reasons not to raise the payout ratio is that you wouldn't want to have to cut it once you raised it. I'm curious, one, why you'd ever have to cut it. And two, if you're buying back stock, you're rewarding investors for selling your stock. And if you're paying a dividend, you're rewarding investors for keeping it. Wouldn't you want to reward the latter more than the former? And I guess, just as a lower growth company versus the S&P, not your peers, and you do throw off a lot of cash, a higher payout ratio might seem somewhat befitting, and you might attract more income-oriented investors. So just curious how you do think about that, if we can get any more color.","W. Rodney McMullen","Sure. I don't think I said I was worried about having to cut it. I said, from an overall dividend strategy, a company, once you start a dividend, you go down that path wanting to make sure you can maintain it and grow it over time. That's more of a textbook dividend philosophy, not a Kroger worry that we're worried about cutting it. We have grown it every year since we've instituted our dividend. We would expect to continue to grow our yield and payout ratio over time. We think our stock, where it's been trading particularly of late, is a very inexpensive buy, and we think the potential return for us on buying the stock and at this point in time really rewards that share -- I think it does reward that shareholder who continues to own our stock and not sell the stock. I'm not really rewarding the shareholder who sells the stock to me at $22 a share. I'm rewarding the shareholder who continues to hold that and is going to enjoy the ride up from $22 with us as we continue to generate great results.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It's Robbie Ohmes. Just a couple of quick questions. The first was if you could comment on -- is the percentage of your customer base on EBT, has that continued to totally flatten out? Or is that still increasing? I was just curious. And then the second question was just on the strength of your natural foods business and how you're approaching that. I was just curious if you could maybe shed some light going forward, how you see that area of your business linking in with dunnhumby. Is it linked in with the dunnhumby JV already and being used to continue to drive loyal customers? Or is it an area that you merchandise that is just gaining momentum on its own? And maybe just give us some color on how you foresee that part of your business playing out over the next year or 2.","David B. Dillon","I'll comment on the EBT and then I'll ask Rodney to comment on the natural food trend and the rest of your question. We are not seeing an increase in the EBT percent of our business. What we are seeing though, of course there's been some variations from week-to-week and even month-to-month in various markets, and a lot of that has to do with the way states are paying out those benefits; often, they're spreading it out now rather than all at the first of the month, which is what they used to do. And so it's a little bit hard to read, but it's definitely not rising. If anything, it's settling down just a bit. But it's just a bit, so I wouldn't read a lot into that either. Rodney, you want to comment about natural food?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. On the question on dunnhumby, natural foods has always been tied into dunnhumby. Now -- it would be true for natural foods and other parts of the store, too. We continue to get better at target marketing personalization for all customers to make sure that they understand what we offer in natural foods. The biggest growth in natural foods is really regular customers that aren't just diehard natural foods or organic shoppers are finding some of the products taste better, some of the items -- they just like the item, it's more creative. So you'll see customers that aren't necessarily just natural foods shoppers but shoppers that find something they like and they'll buy in that category. And certainly, my wife and I would be one that would fall into that category.","David B. Dillon","Rodney keeps bringing examples of new stuff in for us to try, so he speaks from experience.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just one last follow-up question. I was curious, I know Wal-Mart has launched a sort of a different TV advertising campaign in a bunch of markets and, I think, in some cases, or at least in one, they've included polling someone who's shopped your store and tried to show a more competitive average basket. And I was curious if you could comment on whether you've felt any significant impact from that approach.","David B. Dillon","Well, we won't talk about any specific competitive issues, I don't think. But generally speaking, I think you can see, with our sales and the trends that we've identified, that's probably the best way to describe where we are. And remember that what we've said is our whole program is more than price. We've invested a lot in price certainly, but what we've tried to do is neutralize price from being the main issue, to where the main issue for us is our people and our products and our shopping experience.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to talk a little bit about gross profit dollars. It seemed -- and people kind of obsessed with comps when they look at slowing inflation, but I think gross profit dollars are more important. What happens when -- with the deflation in produce and you saw a big increase in volume, would you also say that gross profit dollars were up?","David B. Dillon","Mike, you want to comment? Or -- we're actually going to look that up and see if we can give a more specific answer.","J. Michael Schlotman","I don't have that at the tip of my fingers [indiscernible]...","David B. Dillon","I would agree with you though on the theme of gross profit dollars. We think about our business in terms of dollars and not in terms of percents.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And certainly, we know gross profit dollars per script are higher with generics.","David B. Dillon","Yes, yes. In fact, in pharmacy, it's crystal clear that while we're -- our sales change, because of the generics, is actually pretty radical on those items. But the gross profit dollars is similarly radical in the other direction.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. When you look at the produce department, our gross profit rate would have been down because of the deflation. But because of the tonnage, we generated a pretty good amount of incremental gross profit dollars.","David B. Dillon","Yes. Just exactly what you were thinking, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. And I guess you had talked about moderating inflation in some other categories, not outright deflation, and that inflation could come down faster than tonnage would go up. But do you think that still the net impact of all of that would be the gross profit dollars, at worst, would be flat?","W. Rodney McMullen","I would think -- I mean, if you look at specific guidance, you'll always have exceptions. But when you look at it overall, we're still expect and focused on having improving gross profit dollars when you look at it overall.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So I can tell people who are worried about the moderating inflation to cool it, just calm down.","David B. Dillon","Yes, we think so.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes.","David B. Dillon","I would completely agree with that view.","W. Rodney McMullen","And remember, part of the change in our expected identical sales is because of the -- all the prescriptions coming off patent, as Dave and Mike mentioned. And that improves gross profit, and that's something that's -- this year, the number of drugs, as you know, coming off patent, is significantly higher than any year, certainly since we've been involved in this business.","David B. Dillon","Yes. And we've overemphasized that point for a reason, because we're really kind of nervous that when you see what we've forecasted for the identical sales for the year, you'll -- someone will read that and conclude that things are getting worse. But in fact, the pharmacy affects most or all of that.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just talking about pharmacy quickly, first, do you still think you're getting more than your fair share of Express Scripts customers, the ones who are leaving Walgreen? And then also, how sticky do you think they would be if there was a resolution between Express Scripts and Walgreen?","W. Rodney McMullen","To me, that's a great question. It's always tough to answer because it's one of those where I'll answer it both ways. You never get -- unless you have 100% of something, it's never your fair share. So -- but if you look at the share that we think we're getting of the Express Scripts, it's certainly higher than our market share is of pharmacy in the markets that we operate in. So we certainly feel like we're getting more than our fair share based on that. On the stickiness, the real key for us is making sure that we're delivering great service to those customers that come to us. Because when they come to us, that's one less shop they have to go to, and we should be able to save them time. As long as we have good -- great service and the prices are right, that should be the stickiness. And we're doing an awful lot of work making sure that the customers tell us how we're doing, specifically those customers, and making sure any things that we can do better, we're focused on doing better. So if that did change, there would be more stickiness to that customer.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And do you have tie-ins with your frequent shopper program and deals to create loyalty? I mean, one of Walgreen's weaknesses, in my opinion, is that they don't have a frequent shopper program. Is that something that you think helps you keep the customers?","W. Rodney McMullen","We certainly do. And you should assume that anything that you can imagine, we're trying to do those things to help improve that stickiness.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.","Mike Otway - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Just kind of in terms of a follow-up from a question earlier. With fuel having come down pretty decently and going below that $3.50, an important $3.50 mark in some markets, have you noticed a change in the consumer or in consumer spending in the last few weeks specifically?","David B. Dillon","Not that I can discern. Rodney, anything you could...","W. Rodney McMullen","No, I would agree with that.","David B. Dillon","And I don't remember exactly where it was the same week last year, but -- the real issue on fuel, at least in the quarter, was that it did not rise as much as had widely been anticipated. It was still generally up.","W. Rodney McMullen","The other thing I think from a consumer standpoint, they're still nervous about is it a permanent decline? Or it just happens to be 2 or 3 weeks? And I think that really have behavior change, customers have got to get comfortable with more than just 2 or 3 weeks.","Mike Otway - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then I guess just switching over to SG&A quickly. You guys had some nice leverage there. As inflation continues to decelerate and comps come in further, at what point do you start to delever? Maybe perhaps some color around there would be great.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I think we'll be fine on our ability to do that with the productivity processes we have and getting better execution on the productivity. Also keep in mind, as the sales, ID sales in the back half of the year get more affected by the generics, those do generate a higher gross profit. So when you look underneath the dollars we have to spend on that OG&A, we should be able to get sufficient coverage of that, which is the cornerstone of us guiding to a slightly improving operating profit for the year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just quickly again on Express Scripts. I just was wondering, were you guys actually -- did you gain more share on Express Scripts than you expected to? Or can you maybe just give a little color on that?","W. Rodney McMullen","I'd say we're -- so far, it's been a little bit better than we expected, and we continue to stay focused on that. So yes.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then looking at operating expenses, I guess, if I remember correctly, in the first quarter of last year, you seem to have a similar pattern where you got the expense savings ahead of spending, which is just kind of what you plan on -- you indicated you planned on doing going forward. So is it fair to say that, that's kind of what happened this quarter? You definitely saw some expense savings ahead of the investment in price, and we may see investment in price accelerate throughout the rest of the year?","W. Rodney McMullen","I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean, it's one of the reasons why we wanted to make sure that we raised the guidance, so that you could see that some of the extra improvement in the first quarter, we actually think it will flow through for the whole year. If you look at our expense savings versus what we expected, we're pretty in line with what we expected. And we did a nice job of balancing between gross and OG&A improvements. And we're really focused on trying to make sure the 2 tie together. I don't know, Mike or Dave.","J. Michael Schlotman","We have to balance it for the rest of the year because at the end of the first quarter, with the operating profit margin down 11 basis points and guidance to slightly grow that by the end of the year, we have to remain in balance. Otherwise, that won't be the result.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at your cash flow, I was just curious, accrued expenses definitely was a benefit for you guys. Is there anything to talk to there?","J. Michael Schlotman","Nothing specific. We can talk offline on that. Taxes are in there, but nothing outlandish that I can think of.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Janney Capital Markets.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit, because you -- an earlier caller mentioned lower gasoline prices' effect on the consumer. But what I'm interested in is when you -- first of all, when you go '08 into '09, you saw some significant dis-inflation and then deflation, and the tonnage went through the roof at that time. And are there -- I guess what I'd ask is are there areas outside of produce where you believe a significant -- I know you're not calling for that this year, but let's just say relief and perhaps decline in some of your costs and some of the prices you're able to offer consumers would stimulate more demand and actually drive tonnage? Because I've been hearing from some of the food manufacturers for a long time, about this consumer whose got $100 to spend at the grocery store and has been having to stretch it further and further. Do you get more discretionary buying if that $100 actually winds up going further at some point over the next 6 to 12 months?","David B. Dillon","Well, when I think about inflation, I always separate the perishable departments from the packaged products in the center of the store. That's important because the behavior is actually quite a little bit different. So I would expect some inflation and deflation happening over any course of the year in both produce and meat as examples. And we just manage that in the course of business. And you have behavior that happens like what happened in produce last quarter, which we've described. But the essence of your question really goes to the center of the store and the packaged goods. And normally, when I'm talking about food inflation, I'm usually talking about that because it behaves a little less erratic. The deflationary times that you talked about before was where the CPG operators needed more tonnage. Their costs were such that they needed to reinvest back in their products. They'd let their prices get too high. As commodity costs went up, they went up, and they went up a little higher plus some, and then they had to overcorrect actually in the other direction. So tonnage then did pick up. You were right about that particular case. I don't think we've seen quite the same overreaction so far on the upside this time, although I could be wrong. Some individual operators could have a different view of that. And so it remains to be seen how they'll behave. I don't know, Rodney, if you have any additional color.","W. Rodney McMullen","No.","David B. Dillon","So I don't think -- we're not really thinking that there's going to be some erratic change here.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","So you think a decline and -- a significant decline, let's say down 1% or 2% versus, let's say low-single digit we're thinking about, by the end of this year now would drive additional tonnage in the center store?","David B. Dillon","Well, I think that's -- first, it's hypothetical, and I just as soon not get into all the possible scenarios that could happen. But second is that it would be highly dependent upon individual companies. So if a company invested in their products and sold them to us at a lower price and had them retailed as a result at a lower price, it sees tonnage in those items. But whether or not you'll see that or not is really going to be up to those individual companies.","W. Rodney McMullen","The other thing that was going on back in '08, '09, as Dave mentioned, some of the CPGs were making way too much in margin. And part of the huge tonnage growth we experienced and saw was in our own brands. And it's one of the values that we have because we have such a strong corporate brand program across so many categories. When the economics of the product is different than what the CPGs are charging, we can't -- we will give that benefit to the customer, and we always get rewarded in huge tonnage increases. And if you remember, we had tremendous improvement in market share on our corporate brands at that point, too.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Mike, it's not that often that we hear you talking about pharmacy during the call, so I wanted to ask if that was a meaningful swing in year-over-year EPS contribution for pharmacy this quarter.","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, it certainly helped the EBITDA growth in the first quarter, but there were plenty of other items inside the other departments that contributed to the EBITDA growth being stronger than we expected for the quarter. As Dave and Rodney have both said, every department inside the store had positive ID sales. So it was a pretty good broad-based improvement across the whole complex. There's always rough spots anytime you have to do as many things as we do. There's always things that could be better. But we were pretty happy with the overall balance inside the quarter.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","As you look at the year, how big do you think the overall ID drag could be from pharmacy because of the generic effects? And do you think it makes sense to maybe call out the ID without the pharmacy in some of these future quarters?","J. Michael Schlotman","We've made a commitment to talk about the pharmacy as we go throughout the year and try to describe the effect of that. I don't want to commit right now what I will give or not give, and we'll look at that throughout the year. There's just so many moving parts with some moderating inflation, some higher gross profit rates from generics, the addition of Express Scripts. It's kind of early in the game, if you will, to make a decision on exactly how we'll break that out.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just -- can you -- any way you can give us a magnitude on how big the overall drag effect could be for the whole year?","J. Michael Schlotman","We think, for the whole year, it could be as much as 50 basis points drag on IDs. But it will be increasing as we go throughout the year, to Dave's earlier comment.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Alton Stump with Longbow Research.","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","Just to follow up on a couple of questions earlier. The talk with the CPG companies moving into the back half of the year and how they got huge margins looking back to '08, '09, if that happens again, how much leverage does Kroger have to push back on CPG companies to bring down their pricing?","David B. Dillon","Well, first, let me comment that since it's 11:00, this will be our last question.","W. Rodney McMullen","[Indiscernible]","David B. Dillon","Oh, we'll have time for one more. Okay. Before we get to that, I wanted to make sure you had a time reference here. But in thinking about CPG companies, one of the reasons Rodney pointed out about our Kroger brands and its success, and we had continuous success in the first quarter, was to illustrate that we do have leverage, particularly when the underlying commodity economics don't match what's happening in the market. We, of course, would experience some of the same costs that other manufacturers would experience. But when they stray from those basic economics, we have pretty good leverage. Do you want to add anything on that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No, no.","David B. Dillon","I think that's how we see that, and so we feel actually pretty good about it. The other thing I actually would add, and I've said this several quarters, is at Kroger, we have had really good success and we have partnered with a number of national brand vendors in very successful ways. And so we have a number of places where our tonnage is up with particular vendors because of plans that we've laid. So that actually is some leverage, too, on the other direction, because we have the capacity to produce really good results for individual companies out there.","Operator","Your final question will come from the line of Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just wanted to ask you 2 questions on your sales trends. First, Dave, I think you said the volatility was pretty high in weekly ID sales.","David B. Dillon","Yes.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Now is that a change in trend? Is that new? Or has that been sort of the way it's been for past few quarters or so?","David B. Dillon","Well, it's certainly been true in the last few quarters. It's different than it was several years back. And the reason I called it out is it makes it hard to read individual weeks. And when you only have 3.5 weeks in a quarter and any of that included an end of the month or first of the month which are the hardest to read, and especially when you have a 2-day shift because of the leap day that is now in our numbers, so the first of the year in any future month this year is 2 days removed from where it was last year, you see even more erratic swings in those weeks. So I just think it's hard to read such short periods of time, and you have to take a little longer to look at it. That's really what I meant.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got you. And the other question is on the slowing in ID sales you're describing kind of incrementally. Should we think of that as basically all due to inflation and volume trends are kind of sticking around flat? Is that what you're trying to tell us?","David B. Dillon","I think that's fairly close. I mean, a little more positive than that, actually. Because as you know, it's hard -- it's really hard to read tonnage. It may sound like it shouldn't be, but it actually is because of the mix changes and all these other things. And we're really trying hard to give you a fair picture of what we think is happening. And it sounds contradictory, but we don't think it is to say, first, as we clearly saw, that tonnage is mildly in the positive direction from where it was last quarter. But it's not so great that we're trying to call that up. We're still calling that basically flat.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Got you. Okay, great.","David B. Dillon","So it's a positive message, not really a neutral message.","Before we end the call, though, I would like to share a few additional thoughts with our associates who listened in today. We encourage them to listen, and so I'll take just a minute or 2 of your time still. I want to thank all of our associates for your tireless efforts to keep food safe for our customers and their families. The International Association for Food Protection recently named Kroger the recipient of its Black Pearl Award for 2012, which recognizes excellence in food safety and advocacy. Rodney and I are especially proud of you for this recognition. Only 4 other retailers have been so recognized by this association. I'm certain that what the association saw in Kroger is our success in continually raising the bar on food safety. Keeping food safe for millions of our customers every day is a tremendous responsibility, one that reflects our deepest commitment to putting customers first. Food safety is everyone's fight every day. Our latest program, FAST, which stands for food at safe temperatures, reminds us to keep products below the low limits in cases, minimize stocking time on refrigerated products and keeping cooler and freezer doors closed. These simple steps help us serve safe and delicious food every day. Thank you for this gift to our customers. This completes our call today. Thank you all for joining us.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Derek, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations.","Cindy Holmes","Thank you, Derek, and thank you, everyone, for your patience while we work out these technical issues. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at www.thekrogerco.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","David B. Dillon","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. If you're on the call, it probably means you did not win the Powerball last night. We do apologize for the technical phone difficulties we had earlier, and thank you for sticking with us.","With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2012 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are obviously delighted about the numbers we just released. Both our GAAP and our adjusted earnings per share growth are the result of the powerful foundation that we have laid for our business to grow. Our core business drove earnings per share growth by more than 20%. This strong result excludes the 2 items identified in our earnings release and the swing in LIFO from year to year.","This was a remarkable quarter by several measures. We achieved our 36th consecutive quarter positive ID supermarket sales growth, we realized a record third quarter earnings per share, we increased total FIFO operating profit dollars and we saw the highest increase in unit movement since the second quarter of 2010.","This quarter illustrates that the strength of our core business positions Kroger to accelerate our earnings per share growth. The economy is slowly improving, but value customers are still struggling. We continue to monitor changes in gas prices and inflation. Customer concern over fuel and energy costs lessened as gas prices declined through the quarter. Rodney will have more to say about declining inflation shortly, which contributed to the growth in our unit movement in the quarter. Overall consumer confidence is up, but it remains fragile. Uncertainty around issues like the fiscal cliff can have a short-term impact on consumer sentiment, as we saw last year during the debt ceiling debate. Kroger is well positioned to successfully navigate through these factors.","I'd like to say thank you again for your participation in the Investor Conference in New York City last month. The purpose of that event was to outline for you our plans to accelerate Kroger's earnings growth. We're implementing our long-term growth strategy, and we are committed to achieving fully diluted earnings per share growth of 8% to 11% plus a higher dividend over time, supported by targeting capital expenditures to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging dunnhumby insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. That is what we believe will grow Kroger and shareholder value, and we are bullish about our future.","Rodney will now discuss how Kroger is executing our growth plans and our positive business results in the third quarter. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. It is definitely an exciting time at Kroger. We have aligned our senior leadership team to accelerate our growth strategy. All across the business, our associates are executing to deliver growth results. In 2013, we plan to build, expand or relocate 50 supermarkets compared to 40 expected this year. We are making good progress adding square footage in 4 fill-in markets, and others are being identified based on various metrics. We are narrowing the list of new markets for future expansion.","Earlier this month, we announced that Kroger will acquire the outstanding shares of Axium Pharmacy, a leading specialty pharmacy that provides specialized drug therapies and support services for patients with complex medical conditions. Axium has the skills Kroger doesn't have, and Kroger's size can help Axium grow. Offering specialty pharmacy services will give our customers greater access to drugs we currently can't dispense and access to additional services that we don't provide today. We're very excited about this new partnership.","One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the third quarter, we grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. Our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.","We also achieved positive identical supermarket sales growth for all households. ID sales growth among loyal households outpaced total household growth. Customers continue to visit our stores more frequently and buy more on a monthly basis. Customers also purchased more items on each trip, a welcome change from what we've seen for the last several quarters. As a result, total units sold were up compared to last year. This tonnage growth confirms our belief that we continue to make market share gains in the overall food retailing industry.","The rate of product cost inflation in the third quarter continued to flatten faster than originally anticipated. We estimate the rate of inflation declined to 1.4%, excluding fuel. Once again, every store department had inflation with the exception of produce and seafood, which both were deflationary.","Now before I discuss our sales results, there are a couple events that affected our pharmacy and overall identical supermarket sales results that I want to share. The growth in generic drugs reduced total identical supermarket sales by 1% in the quarter. Our ability to attract and retain Express Script business has largely offset this effect. The effect of generics is consistent with what we outlined at the start of this year.","I want to congratulate and thank our pharmacy teams for managing through a difficult year. They have done a phenomenal job, and that's an understatement. We are also very pleased with our third quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3.2%, without fuel. The cadence of identical sales throughout the year was balanced. We've also had consistent sales trends through the year when you look at our identical sales, excluding both fuel and pharmacy. And I realize this is a number we normally don't give, but we thought this quarter, you would find it helpful. On this basis, and this is without fuel and pharmacy both, identical sales were a strong 3.2% in the first quarter and 3.1% in the second and third quarters.","Moving now to Kroger's corporate brands. We recently introduced our new Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands, which are free from 101 artificial ingredients and preservatives that some customers have said they do not want in their foods. Together, these are our fastest growing brands, and we are very excited about our early results.","Corporate brands represented approximately 26% of grocery department sales dollars in the third quarter, and grocery department corporate brand units sold were 32.9%. Some of the decline in corporate brand share in grocery is due to some CPG companies getting more aggressive and promoting certain items.","While we strive to grow the corporate brand part of our business over time, we have long said our goal is to give the best value to our customers. And in this quarter, some of the national brands provided a great value. The mix between national brands and corporate brands fluctuate in any given quarter, and we continue to be the market leader in corporate brands.","Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter as OG&A cost, plus rent and depreciation, without fuel and the 2 adjustment items, were down 21 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis, we have had 7 consecutive years of improvement in this metric, and we expect to achieve our eighth consecutive year in 2012.","Last quarter, I provided several examples of investments we are making in non-price keys of our Customer 1st Strategy: Our people, products and shopping experience. Today, I'd like to share one of our great people initiatives that is designed to improve the health and wellness of our associates and keep our health care costs down.","Earlier this year, we partnered with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield to develop an innovative program to provide our associates with access to the top-performing health care providers for several common but expensive surgeries. Participating associates pay less out of pocket at these facilities and benefit from higher quality of care. Kroger pays about 15% less in these hospitals than at others for the same services, even including travel costs. We're excited to be on the leading edge of this kind of program and are pleased with the results so far. We believe it improves our connection with our associates, which in turn strengthens our connection with customers.","Finally, an update on labor relations. Associates in Arizona, Columbus and Memphis have ratified labor agreements. We continue negotiations on many contracts, including Indianapolis, Nashville and Portland for store clerks and a distribution center in Delaware, Ohio. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide good wages, a quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.","Next, Mike will share additional detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and guidance for the rest of the year. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to also thank you for your participation in our investors meeting last month. At that meeting, we laid out 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our success, including ID sales growth, FIFO operating margin growth, a stable and growing return on invested capital and market share growth. We believe holding ourselves accountable for these key metrics will drive shareholder value. We will measure our progress on the first 3 on a quarterly basis and continue to report market share growth on an annual basis at year end.","Rodney went into a lot of detail about the strength of our identical supermarket sales and our ability to leverage operating costs. We are very pleased with our strong performance in these metrics. FIFO gross margin was 20.35% of sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year.","Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $316.5 million or $0.60 per diluted share. This includes a $0.14 benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January. Excluding the benefit of these 2 items because they were not the result of our normal operations, Kroger's adjusted net earnings for the third quarter totaled $242.4 million or $0.46 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $195.9 million or $0.33 per diluted share.","I want to spend just a couple of minutes on LIFO. Many of the items we discuss are on a FIFO basis. We manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge. When we develop our expectations for any given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. We don't believe our operation should generate more or less EBITDA because LIFO was higher or lower in a given period of time. As a result, if LIFO was lower than the prior year, our EPS growth rate will be higher than our targets. And if LIFO is higher than the prior year, our EPS growth rates will be lower than our targets.","This quarter is a good example. We reduced our LIFO charge estimate to $125 million for the year. Previously, we internally estimated the LIFO charge at $150 million. The change in LIFO benefited the quarter by $0.02, which you saw in the earnings that we reported.","Third quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding the 2 adjustment items, increased approximately $29 million over the prior year. Excluding fuel and the adjustment items on a rolling 4 quarters basis, the company's FIFO operating margin was 7 basis points lower compared to last year. Kroger expects to have a slightly higher FIFO operating margin rate, excluding fuel, for the full 2012 fiscal year in line with our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis.","Return on invested capital in the third quarter was 13.3% compared to 13.5% during the same period last year. As I said in New York, we are committed to growing ROIC over time.","Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates. But we view fuel as a core department that over time is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers margin per gallon was approximately $0.149 cents per gallon compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year.","Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: To fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Capital expenditures excluding acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $473.5 million for the third quarter compared with $497 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full year capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range and expect 2013 to be approximately $2.4 billion.","During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 14.5 million common shares for a total investment of $333 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.7 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. As it relates to dividends, you should receive the first payment since our 30% increase this coming Monday.","Net total debt was $8.7 billion, an increase of $1 billion from a year ago. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.08 compared to 1.89 during the same period last year. Our objective is to maintain our current debt rating. We believe a net total debt to EBITDA ratio of 2 to 2.2 will support this.","You may notice on our balance sheet that our current portion of our debt is up compared to what it usually is. One of the reasons for this is we had a little over $1 billion outstanding of commercial paper and in our revolving credit facility with our banks that gets classified as short term. Some of that was extra borrowings, which you saw as cash on the balance sheet in anticipation of disruptions in the commercial paper market as a result of Sandy. And some of it is a strategy to fund some of our cash needs on a short-term basis because we're borrowing about 45 to 50 basis points in the commercial paper market to maintain an exposure to floating rates.","Now I'll update our guidance for the fourth quarter. As a result of solid performance in our core business, Kroger raised its earnings per diluted share guidance, excluding the 2 adjustment items, to $2.44 to $2.46 for the full year, up from the previous guidance of $2.35 to $2.42. This implies a $0.68 to $0.70 earnings per diluted share result in the fourth quarter. With only 1 quarter left in the year, we believe fourth quarter identical sales guidance is most important. And in the fourth quarter, we expect ID sales between 3% and 3.5%, excluding fuel.","We also want to remind you as you start thinking about your own estimates for 2013 that you will need to adjust 2012 results to remove the benefit of the extra week and the 2 items that totaled $0.14 from this quarter. We will provide an estimate of the benefit of the 53rd week when we provide full guidance in March.","Now I will turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Mike. When you look at how Kroger has strengthened our business for the last 10 years and compare us to other food retailers, you'll see that we took the less -- the road less traveled. And when you look today at our ability to deliver positive growth results, you'll understand why we believe that that's made all the difference.","Kroger's proven Customer 1st Strategy continues to increase customer loyalty, identical sales -- store sales and market share. With that foundation firmly in place, we're focused on deploying capital to further accelerate growth and improve ROIC. We are committed to delivering shareholder value through stronger earnings per share growth, higher dividends and stock buyback.","We now look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Edward Kelly from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a quick question for you to start on the MEPP benefit. Dave, talking about guidance that excludes the -- well, excludes both the Visa MasterCard settlement as well as MEPP. I don't remember you saying over prior quarters that the guidance excluded the pension benefit. So is that new this quarter or it was always excluded?","J. Michael Schlotman","Ed, just to clarify, the $50 million reduction that happened this quarter, back in January, we took the $900 million plus charge to establish what that obligation was going to be based on the actuaries' estimate at that point in time. The actuaries recently finished their final work on exactly what that obligation is, and it wound up being $50 million less. So it has nothing to do with what the ongoing cost of that plan is. That was a reduction of the charge we took back in January, and that won't repeat itself. It doesn't have anything to do with the annual cost of that plan.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So what happened this quarter is truly one time?","J. Michael Schlotman","It was an adjustment to results. Certain people don't like the use of one time. Yes.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know. But back in the fourth quarter, you talked about a $0.04 to $0.06 benefit.","J. Michael Schlotman","And we're delivering on that and that's baked into the numbers, and it's our run rate. This $50 million is above and beyond that, and it was just the true-up of what that initial obligation was.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. Okay, that makes sense. And then my next question for you is on the gross margin, a little bit better this quarter than what I was expecting sequentially, a nice improvement, I think, lines up pretty well is what you were talking about at the analyst day. Could you just maybe give us a little bit of color around the gross margin? I know last quarter, 45% of the decline was shrink, for instance. So how did that do? How did you do with non-selling versus selling for instance? Could you talk a little bit about that?","David B. Dillon","Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. As you know, overall, every quarter, what we're trying to do is to balance our improvement in operating costs with a change in gross profit rate. And we continue to be focused on giving our customers a better value than before. So the change in gross profit rate really is given by lowering prices to our customers, and that's what drove it. And we were really pleased with the balance that we had in terms of expense reductions. You specifically asked about shrink. Shrink is an area where we weren't real pleased with our results, but it actually wasn't inconsistent with what I expected. And anytime when you have swings, large swings from heavy inflation to low inflation, it seems that it affects shrink. And I think a lot of the effect this -- the last couple of quarters in shrink has been that. I feel good about where we are overall. As you know, you never want to get so focused on shrink, you hurt yourself. And that's a balance we're always focused on maintaining.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I mean shrink last quarter hurt you by I think it's 19 basis points if we do that 45%. Was that impact similar this quarter?","W. Rodney McMullen","It wasn't quite that bad, but it wasn't something we were pleased with.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And over the next few quarters, is that something that would diminish, do you think?","W. Rodney McMullen","Certainly, yes. I would certainly expect it would diminish. And what we're trying to do is to make sure we manage it on a progressive and strong basis, but not do something that overreacts.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Deborah Weinswig from Citi.","Tiffany Kanaga","This is Tiffany Kanaga from Deborah Weinswig's team. We'd like to know what are you seeing in terms of the competitive environment? And how are you thinking about price investments going forward?","David B. Dillon","The competitive environment, Tiffany, really hasn't changed. We still see, as we've said just about every quarter, robust competition. About the biggest change we see is one market to another is one market might improve a little bit, another market gets a little tougher. But I certainly don't see it as being harder or difficult today than it was last quarter or easier today than it was last quarter. So I'd say it'd be very similar. Rodney, you want to add anything to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No. I would agree completely.","David B. Dillon","And on the price area, I think Rodney answered that best when he said that our interest is in having balance between what we save in terms of operating costs and what we spend in terms of gross. We have lots of places, we think, additional price investment would give benefit not only to our customers, but would ultimately grow the sales and help the shareholders. But we are tempered in our approach to try to make sure we've offset those with costs. Do you want to add anything?","W. Rodney McMullen","I'm just going to add one other thing, Dave. And as you know, we work a lot with dunnhumby to understand the pricing dollars we have to invest to make sure we invest it in places that helps the customer the most. And we've been doing that for several years. And we would continue to work with dunnhumby to help to make sure that it benefits the customer in the best way we can, for what dollars we do have to invest.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So Dave, you mentioned the economy is slowly improving. Do you see evidence in what people are buying or how they're behaving that they are actually reflecting that and opening up a little more? Or is that -- that's not yet happened?","David B. Dillon","Yes, I think we do. I think that -- but the evidence is the slow, gradual improvement that I described. So you look over the last several quarters, you can look at some of the categories we've described before, things like Boar's Head and high-end wines and our fine cheeses, and some of those continue to do pretty good and grow steadily. Natural food is doing well. Another good indicator and one that I'm particularly pleased with, was with our loyalty data. If you look at our loyal households, while we had a big, good solid increase in number of loyal households, the visits, of course, increased. Both of those are consistent with what we've had the last several quarters. But we also had increase in units per visit, an increase there for those loyal households. And I think that's important. I think that's an indication both of us filling all the needs of customers or a greater portion of the needs of customers, which we've talked a lot about before. But I also think it's an indication of people having a little bit more money in their pocket or at least the willingness to buy a little bit more, so that their tentativeness has dissipated somewhat. Now I would caution though, because with value customers, we think that they still are living in a very fragile world, and we think that their situation is still quite difficult. And I'm not actually sure that we've seen improvement there. And we've used the word ourselves in describing the future as pretty fragile. The fragile nature is that you could see high volatility with changes of events, which is why I think the fiscal cliff causes people some heartburn.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, I'm going to ask you, as a follow-up on that, how do you plan for the cliff? I guess you would assume we're not going to go over entirely, but the payroll tax probably goes up and some other things happen. So there will be less money in people's pockets come January, low income and middle income as well. How do you plan for that? And do you put programs in place? Are you doing that now, designing some things that you want to hit in January to target a more frugal customer? Or do you think that's an overly negative assessment?","David B. Dillon","I'll have Rodney add a little color in a minute. But first, I think it is an overly negative assessment, in fact, quite a bit overly negative in my view. At Kroger, I think we've built up a very strong trust with our customer. For our customers to know that where there's value to be had, they can have it with us. And as a result, I believe that whatever happens, and we think we're in a great position in any of the possible outcomes we can imagine, we think that our customers are going to trust us and continue to stay with us. Now our business is a day-to-day business. We make choices every day as merchants what we're going to do. So we read the environment where we are, we make these choices and we move through current events as we always have done. And I expect that, that will be how we would operate through whatever happens in this situation. I think it's going to be -- whatever happens, I think it's going to be overplayed in the press and so will cause a lot of people a lot of chatter in the outfield, but the actual effect will be less than that. Rodney, you may want to add some...","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, I was just going to say that the uncertainty of things I think is what creates the most pain. And the things that we've been doing for the last several years is really focused on giving the customer a better total value package, and price obviously gets a lot of discussion. But we've improved the shopping experience in the products that the customers get just as much as what we've improved pricing on. And when a customer decides where to shop, they're going to look at the total thing. But the uncertainty of it will affect you. But I don't think there's too much that you can do to anticipate a different strategy for that. We just think long term that it's important to give the customer better total value.","David B. Dillon","And John, we don't often get into the public policy arena. And so I'm not certainly trying to forecast what happens. But I do think the one message that's clear from our vantage point is that Congress and the executive branch and the press, frankly, need to look at this responsibly to try to solve the issues and to try not to create undue uncertainty. It's that uncertainty that serves the public really poorly. And we think that there's a lot everyone can do if they make up their mind that they're going to purchase in a responsible way.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just finally, one last thing. Do you think that your market share has accelerated -- market share growth or gains have accelerated during 2012? It looks that way, looking at the data that we can see. Do you think that's right?","David B. Dillon","I don't know that I'd use the word accelerate. Although it may have, I certainly think it has continued to increase. And we think that that's been a fairly steady increase over time. Rodney, I don't know if you...","W. Rodney McMullen","I would -- yes, I don't know that I would so much word it as accelerate, I think I agree completely with Dave that we see it pretty consistent, improving as it has for the last 5 or 6 years.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Meredith Adler, Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, you said you're sort of finalizing the criteria for new markets that you might be considering opening stores in. Could you talk a little bit about what those criteria are \u2013 criterion are and maybe give us a sense of how you expect to proceed?","David B. Dillon","Well, I'll give you a little sense. We obviously won't tell you a lot. And I'm not sure that what I'm going to tell you would be much more than what we said in New York. But our interest is in being able to use our existing infrastructure, warehouses and support and merchandising and so forth. And so that would tend to say that we're not going to go to some markets that are further away, and I think that's probably an accurate reflection. And we're interested in being able to, over time, grow our overall business. We think we've developed a model that the customers really like. And we think that the customers -- and particularly, if you look around, most of the markets we operate in and a bunch of markets we don't operate in, the places that the people are winning in food retailing today actually are mostly in supermarkets. Now you don't see that as much because a lot of those supermarkets are private markets, are not publicly owned, so you don't see the data. But many of the winners are supermarkets. And as a result, we think there's a lot of places that would actually benefit from our kind of store as a supermarket. And we see that as a real plus. Now other than that, I'm not sure that we're going to go out and describe much more. Our objective is to narrow it down to the markets that we think are important and then to do investigation in the real estate side of it and then to proceed through actually operating an action plan, which we would do in almost anything we do really. So that's really the basic plan, but I don't think that adds anything to what I've told you.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, this may be a follow-on with that. You had opened a few Food 4 Less stores in Chicago a number of years ago. Do you see the move into new markets or even the fill-in being different kinds of formats than a traditional Kroger? Would it be a marketplace store, more likely to be Food 4 Less or some other discount-oriented store or it'll be a little bit of everything?","David B. Dillon","We see all of those as on the table. We like the Food 4 Less format. We like the marketplace format. We like our traditional supermarket format. We like our convenience store format. So we see all of those as having high potential, and it would be based upon the specific market. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? Anything else, Meredith?","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I guess I wanted to go back to the question about competition, which you -- I understand is pretty stable. Do you see any risk that rapidly moderating inflation and maybe not everybody's tonnage is recovering as nicely as yours that, that will get -- sort of freak out some of your competitors and we will see more price aggressiveness from them?","David B. Dillon","No, I don't expect to see that. And of course, you'll always have some individual markets and some individual settings where that might occur. But on the whole, I view that the competitors that we compete with, whether they're supermarkets, whether they're publicly owned or not, whatever they are, we view it as quite rational. We think people are making rational choices, what they view to be in their best long-term interest, and we certainly are doing the same.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious what you would do if you were in a vendors' shoes right now in center store? And the reason I'm asking is across all of food, center store seems to continue to lag. Are you happy with the level and quality of innovation and marketing you're getting from your vendors? You talked about national brands promoting heavily. Is that something you want to see? Or would you rather get fewer dollars from deal backs and just have your vendors spend more money kind of investing in their brands and driving the categories higher that way? I'm just curious how you think about that balance there in the long term.","David B. Dillon","I think Rodney will answer that.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. Your question on innovation, if you talk to any of us, we would say that no one can ever have enough innovation. It's what makes it fun. And I can tell you every time we have a top-to-top meeting, we're always pushing our CPG partners to have more innovation. It's something that causes the shopping experience to be more fun. It causes the customer to look at somebody's product and obviously, we sell more. From our perspective, we're really kind of indifferent in terms of how a vendor spends their money. Because if they get to where their pricing is too high, that's the reason why we think our corporate brand, our strong corporate brand program is so positive, is because it gives a great value at great quality for our customers. So if a vendor CPG gets to where their price is too high and they spend 20 times as much as they spent before marketing, that balance won't work for them. So we really are focused on how do we work with our CPG partners, how do we grow their business together. And if they get to the point where they get out of balance, we find our corporate brands always picks up share. And as I mentioned in the call, obviously our grocery tonnage was up very nicely in the quarter, and in fact the best since the second quarter of 2010.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one quick one, maybe I missed it. Can you give us some help on what quarter-to-date comps have been?","David B. Dillon","We haven't described that yet, but we'd be happy to tell you that. At the moment, quarter-to-date and the fourth quarter were a little bit higher than what we ran in the third quarter. But I would not read too much into that because we expect, as we have seen in the last year or 2, high volatility from 1 week to the next, particularly as the payments for the food stamps, for the staff payments, how that has been smoothed out over some of the months. We've seen even higher volatility compared to the previous year. We do expect to have a good holiday selling season, with Christmas 2 days later from when Thanksgiving falls than last year. We think that actually works well. But a couple of the weeks will be pretty soft weeks. So we're giving you the reading as of today, as through yesterday. But if you look at today's sales, they're going to be pretty sloppy, as an example, because last year was the first of the month where today, it's 2 days before the end of the month. So that's why I urge caution, don't read too much into that. But we're running currently a little bit better than the third quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen","The other thing -- Dave mentioned it, but the swings within a month is a lot more than we had before. And John's earlier question about which customer segments are improving and which ones aren't, if you look at the mainstream and upscale customers, it's pretty consistent and it's solid throughout a month. But a value customer, we see a tremendous amount of more swing today than we would have seen even last year or 2 years ago. And Dave mentioned that before.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Charles Grom, Deutsche Bank.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Shane Higgins on for Chuck. First of all, I thought it was really interesting that you guys laid out that the nonfuel, non-pharmacy IDs, and obviously they looked pretty nice and remarkably stable. How does that compare to the growth in your markets? I know you guys have been picking up share pretty consistently. Would 2% to 3% kind of growth or how should we think about that?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I'm not sure what you mean by growth in the markets, if you're asking about population growth and the like. But overall, it's really the result of a combination of things Dave and Rodney have already described. Dave described increased visits and increased units per visit, and Rodney has described that our tonnage was the strongest since second quarter of 2010. And it's really a combination of all those factors that has allowed us to continue to grow. We don't want to speculate on exactly where our market share is today. It's a calculation we do once a year, and we'll describe that in March when we release full year results. But it's been pretty broad-based. As Rodney said, all of the departments have had positive identical food store sales again this quarter. And we continue to be very pleased with the broad-based performance.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. So I guess as inflation has moderated and you guys touched on -- so tonnage has actually been steadily improving over the past 3 quarters, has been driving more that ID sales.","J. Michael Schlotman","It actually has -- inflation has come in a little faster than we would have originally predicted, which was reflected in the reduction of our LIFO reserve. And the effect on the tonnage picking up, it's actually picked up a little faster than we expected. I don't want to say it's all just because there's less inflation. Certainly, a lot of it is the value equation we give to our customers, and the way we go to market every day continues to resonate with the customer. So it's a combination of factors. But bottom line, that's -- your comment is true.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. And how should we think about the inflation over the next couple of months? Are you hearing -- sorry if you guys already talked about this, but are you hearing anything from vendors in terms of prices going up, any impact from the drought?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, there are certainly some of the futures out there that would indicate higher costs. Some of those, they're off their peaks when you look at the corn and soybeans and things like that. Certainly, portions of the protein complex continue to have a lot of inflation. The beef side has a lot inflation. That's offset right now by some deflation in the pork side, and the seafood right now is deflationary. So we really look at it of what item is out there that has the right price points that's going to resonate with the customer. I don't want to speculate on 2013 inflation at this point. But I think the year is playing out to end a little bit lower inflation level than we originally predicted. And there are commodities out there that are the other way; things like sugar hasn't had nearly the same effect, orange juice is below the 5-year average. So there are those categories out there that have some positive influence.","Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great. Just one last question on your ID sales you guys refer on the outlook for the year. It does imply kind of a 1% to 3% type number for the fourth quarter. And based on your earlier comments about recent trends being actually slightly better than third quarter, what -- are you guys just being conservative in kind of leaving the guidance unchanged? Is there concern about the impact of the fiscal cliff? How should we think about that?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. I was worried when we used the same number in the press release that it could be read that we reaffirm 3% to 3.5% as our annual number. That's actually just specific fourth quarter guidance. And we wanted to make sure people -- I didn't want to use the annual guidance because there's only 12 weeks left in the quarter, and you would have gotten a number like that. So the 3% to 3.5% we described is actually just for the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky, Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Can you give us a sense, Dave, on how the consumer behaved around the Thanksgiving buying period and how it compared to last year?","David B. Dillon","We were very pleased with the Thanksgiving selling this year, thought it went quite well. And both pleased from an operational point of view and a merchandising point of view. But the customer reaction was solid and improving, just like we've been improving all year on other things.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Okay. And how about the gas profitability? Up nicely year-over-year. Mike, what are sort of the dynamics around that? Is it increased traffic or less competition from fuel merchants? What's happening there?","David B. Dillon","Well, you can see that the gas prices during the quarter were volatile. And anytime gas prices are volatile, you get things that change one way or the other. And this particular quarter had a bit higher margins and had even higher margins towards the end of the quarter as the gas prices came down. And in fact that helped the quarter, as you could see in the numbers, and as Mike I think described. We saw identical gallons up, so we're good, solid there. And I think that's a bit of a countertrend compared to where the industry is. And that's, we believe, because we're adding fuel stations, because we are connecting with the customers and they like having gas right at the grocery store and because of our fuel rewards program.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, ID gallons were up in both the C-store offering and in the supermarket fuel offering. And on the supermarkets, I think, should have -- I want to comment just a little bit more, only because to have the strong identical fuel gallons we've had is pretty impressive as we continue to add fuel markets to our existing stores. And that could potentially cause sister store impact from one fuel center to another. Our total gallons sold into supermarket fuel centers was up a lot more than our IDs were. But we still maintain that strong, solid ID even with the growing number of outlets for consumers to go to.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Mark Wiltamuth, Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Mark Wiltamuth, Morgan Stanley. I wanted to ask about the credit card settlement. You've got a pretty good gain there. There have been periods in the past when you've taken big windfalls and plowed it back into reinvesting into price. Is that the intention here? Or is this just separate from your overall strategy on pricing?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, you got to think about this a little bit different. This settlement included a cash component, which obviously is in our financials, but also a change of the rules under which you could take the cards and deal with the cards with your customers. So on one hand, the amount that we've described and adjusted our earnings for, that went to the shareholders. But the rules change, we think there's some benefits there for our customers that can incentivize the customer to use the lower form of payment and that of course, goes to them. So we'd see it as a really big win. It's a win for the customer, it's a win for the shareholder. All around, we think it works well. So I think that's how we expect to play it out.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at your rolling 4 quarter EBIT, down 7 basis points, and you're still looking for it to be up for the year once you're finished with the fourth quarter. Is there something rolling off on fourth quarter last year that really kind of helps you get to positive? And where do you kind of stand on the 3 quarters to date so far?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I'm actually glad you asked that question, Mark, because we resisted the temptation to put that metric in our prepared comments because we don't like to shift how we measure ourselves. One of the things that gives us comfort with our ability to increase that for the full year, when you look at year-to-date without fuel and the 2 adjustment items, we're actually down 1 basis point year-to-date. So it's not like we have to -- from where we are at year-to-date, we only have to go up a few to get it to be positive. But the rolling 4 quarters has -- last year's third quarter actually was very strong, and that's one of the things that caused the comparison to be a little off. And that is on a 52-week basis, not a -- we're not using the extra week to cause that to be the outcome.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So that does imply some better margin here coming up in the fourth quarter?","J. Michael Schlotman","It implies a little bit better. Keep in mind, it only has to go -- it only has to be 2 or 3 basis points better to get me positive for the year.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Karen Short, BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just to clarify on inflation for the fourth quarter. Your full year LIFO guidance implies kind of $30 million in LIFO expense for the fourth quarter. Is that -- is this quarter just a true-up, because it sounds like you're saying that you think the fourth quarter inflation is going to be similar to the third?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, we reduced our annual estimate by $25 million based on what we see today. And to get the year-to-date rate, you have to take 10\/13 of that reduction into this quarter, and then the fourth quarter winds up just being 3\/13 of $125 million. So that's how you ought to wind up thinking about what the numbers are.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, that's helpful. And then I'm just curious on your shrink, can you kind of maybe elaborate a little bit on what your strategy is to tackle shrink, and what you think the timing might be on seeing some improvement?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, it should be a little each quarter. The detail in terms of how you accomplish it, it's all the basics. Some of it is driven by actual theft. There's all kinds of things that you work on in terms of trying to reduce the actual theft. One of the things that's constantly surprising is how much more sophisticated some of the theft rings are today than they were even 2 or 3 years ago. And it's just making sure that we put even more focus on some of those, some of it's basic operations. And that's blocking and tackling. It's nothing really very fancy. It's making sure you get deliveries into the store at the right time, i.e. take market downs appropriately and those things. So it's not fancy. Our expectation of ourselves would be to gradually improve and get it back to where we're satisfied again.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","How much of it is actually theft versus say...","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, you never know for sure. Internally, we would probably really tell you. We think it's about half and half, but that is a wild guess because you really don't know for sure.","David B. Dillon","With all this conversation about shrink, I ought to at least add my own thought is that, as shrink goes, we actually are in pretty good shape. I don't want to give anybody the impression we think we have a big shrink problem. And by 2 questions like that on that could give you that impression. But we see improvement to be made.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Got it. Okay. And then I guess last question is just a few years ago when you really had very, very strong tonnage growth, it was so strong it kind of became hard to manage from kind of an expense perspective. I guess I was just wondering if tonnage does continue to improve, what kind of changes you've made to prevent this from happening again or what you think your expenses are going to look like?","David B. Dillon","I recall those issues were really more because of the volatile nature from one quarter to the next and what we were seeing there. And I think what we've seen now is more steady. Plus, I think we've given a lot of thought to what we went through that period, and I think we're being very intelligent about the way in which we're operating our store. Rodney, if you want to add any color...","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, the only other thing that, when tonnage was so strong before, and this would happen in any situation, the actual work and the number of hours that we schedule on our stores is driven by the tonnage that goes through it. So at that point in time, we had almost -- I mean basic identical sales were only 1% to 2% positive, but we were growing our tonnage by 5% or 6%. So anytime you grow tonnage by that much, you're going to have more hours to actually do the physical work.","David B. Dillon","Yes, I'm glad Rodney added that. Because, frankly, if I look back over the last 10 years, one of the things that I'm most proud of us doing in this company is that point, is that as you experience inflation but not have tonnage growth, we modify our hours to do the work, not to handle the dollar sales. And so as you have deflation or low periods of inflation and tonnage growth, we still have the hours in to do the work, so the customers don't end up suffering. We said all along that our Customer 1st Strategy is making sure we run our stores in a way that connects really well with customers. And in the past, we ran it with the dollars, and today, we run it with the cases. And it's a much more effective way to do it. And that's one of the reasons, because we've done it for so long now, our customers really trust us and appreciate us.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin, Jefferies & Company.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, so I just want to do some housekeeping items. Did you guys actually give the tonnage number? I know you said it was the best since the second quarter of '10 or something like that. But did you give the actual number?","J. Michael Schlotman","We did not.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Do you want to?","J. Michael Schlotman","I'll defer to Rodney and Dave.","W. Rodney McMullen","Scott, I don't think it's helpful to do that. We're happy with it. In prior quarters, we described it as marginally positive, and we're happier with it than that. It was a very strong quarter for tonnage.","David B. Dillon","And actually, the reason we don't want to give it is that it doesn't have the kind of precision that giving a number might imply it would have. And because it doesn't, we're trying to make a rational judgment as to what the number really says, and we're interpreting it and telling you what that number says. We try to do that really with this whole call as our objective here is to let you see this business through our eyes and give you the weight of what we think is actually happening.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, if you just want to get a rough calculation, Scott, just take our identical sales less the inflation estimate we provided. I mean it's not exactly right, but it's roughly close.","David B. Dillon","And certainly directionally correct, true.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that goes back to kind of a second housekeeping item. I know you guys answered this a little bit. But it seems to me that the delta, your volume delta between you and the industry, or the delta volume between you and the industry, better way to say it, has been widening out, which is very suggestive of share gains accelerating. Yet you didn't want to commit to that on the call, and I'm kind of a little surprised about that. I don't know if you have any further comments on that.","David B. Dillon","I think we're quite clear that we believe we've picked up share. We just don't think it's been dramatic or sudden. We think it's been gradual over time. And it does -- what you just said does help describe what we think is happening in the industry overall where people buy food. The industry has widened to places not just supermarkets. So you've seen a lot of the mass operators and the dollar stores and the drugstores and club stores, all those places sell food, and so now the market is a much wider market. But the winners and losers in that market, it's always been true in food retailing. There's people who are being more successful than others. And a lot of the success today comes, a few of the public companies are ones that are outside of the supermarket industry, except for Kroger. You add Kroger into that mix. And then you have some private companies, and you don't see their numbers. But we happen to know that those private companies, based on what we see in the markets, that they have been improving too. So we think that we are separating ourselves from many in the industry. We are among the winners in the industry, and we think that there are other winners in the industry as well.","W. Rodney McMullen","The only thing, Dave, I would add -- and Scott, as you know, we really focus more on market share on an annual basis rather than quarter-to-quarter. We're certainly pleased with where we think we are. But really, once a year is when we step back and really dig into the numbers in a very detailed way. So to answer the question, it isn't so much we're trying to avoid it. It's just that during the year, we wouldn't focus as much energy on trying to understand it, as long as directionally the numbers look like they're tracking in a good way.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. Perfect. I have 2 more quick ones, I'll just roll them together. So really excited about the ROIC focus, as I think you guys know. But I was hoping for an update on when we can see ROIC as part of the long-term executive incentive plan. I think Dave indicated at the analyst day that, that change would likely be forthcoming. And then the second housekeeping item is x fuel EBIT dollars, were they up or not? So those 2, and then I'll yield.","J. Michael Schlotman","On the first one, yes, x fuel EBIT operating profit dollars, just so I'm talking to my terms versus how you may calculate it, x fuel operating profit dollars were up in the quarter, yes.","David B. Dillon","And then to your question about ROIC and the long-term incentive plan, we actually have a board meeting next week with our comp committee. And one of the areas that we plan to explore with them and to suggest to them is to add a component along those lines. But it's our comp committee that makes that decision ultimately and -- so stay tuned. But it's not going to happen instantly. You'll probably hear -- be able to hear about it on the next call.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Wolf, BB&T.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I wanted to ask you on the turnaround or the turn-up in the unit count. Using dunnhumby and other ways to look at it, can you kind of differentiate between how much of that is kind of sold on promotion? I think last quarter, you'd mentioned you were sending out more direct mail coupons to increase penetrations or in categories with certain customers. So much is sort of on promotion and maybe something that maybe only Kroger can pull off versus how much of it is maybe the environment?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at the mix, the growth is pretty balanced between everyday-type items and promotional-type items. So we felt really good about it because a lot of the growth is from new customers, and those are more sustainable. So a nice balance between the 2, and it really didn't change versus earlier in the year.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","That's exactly what I was getting at. And my housekeeping question is on the extra week. I think you indicated you can't tell us what that might affect EPS and earnings for until -- or did you already say what it is and I missed that? And what I'm getting at is if I'm trying to adjust EBITDA to a calendarized basis, let's say -- or EBIT, FIFO EBIT, can I just straight-line it? Or are there some expenses that are treated where you get a benefit because it doesn't have the extra week?","J. Michael Schlotman","You cannot straight-line it. This isn't the first time we've had a 53rd week year, and we've always described what the effect of that is and what items you cannot straight line. So that's out there historically. The only reason -- certainly, we have an estimate internally of what we think the benefit of that extra week will be. At the end of the day, it'll be driven by how many sales dollars fall into that week. It will be one of those weeks that falls in, crossing the calendar into the first of the month, has a couple fewer days at the first of the month than the prior year's week it's going to be comparing to add. So that's the only reason we've had any hesitancy about saying exactly what that benefit is going to be. We have a good feel for it. But we'll let you know when we see exactly where sales were and when we release full year numbers in March.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And my last question, actually I want to get to digital marketing, because I think Dave mentioned that in his preamble. And just looking at the website, corporate website, to me, at least, it looks like a complete makeover into a really digital-driven platform. And so my questions are twofold. First, is it too early to -- if I'm right, is it too early to -- or do you have any sort of preliminary information on what that's doing for the business? And secondly, just overall, where do you see digital marketing going? I mean some folks think it's going to slowly or maybe even rapidly, replace print media for distributing coupons on a mass basis and so forth.","David B. Dillon","Andy, I'm so glad you noticed, because that's true. We've done a lot of work on our website, and we continue to do updates to our app that's available too for mobile devices. And we're very excited about that. And I think what we've seen is that gradual interest by our customers in connecting with us both in the traditional ways, that really has continued to be strong, but also in digital ways. And the more we have improved, the more we see those customers engaged. So we're seeing a gradual improvement there. It's not some sudden improvement. And in terms of the business, we certainly are getting a lot of digital coupons that we take as an example. That number is quite high. And so we see a lot of activity. But it's hard really to measure the specific results that would be derived from digital marketing versus the specific results in traditional marketing. We see it as blended together, and we see that the customer who responds to one also responds to the other. You have some people who are just digital and others who are just traditional, but many people fall into the camp of both. And so it's really hard to read what caused their activity and what caused their emotion. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? I think that would be it, Andy. What else?","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just one follow-up. Just on the development side, some companies I follow have gone outside the company to folks who have been doing digital marketing, maybe for longer in other industries, some have done it internally. Could you comment on how the development in terms of personnel has been?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, it's a good question. We actually have a mix of both, and the team is probably about half and half. And if you look at who's helping us, we're partnering with several different outside companies. So -- and right now, we like the balance because we think it's the best of both. Obviously, dunnhumby is helping us with that as well.","Operator","Your final question is coming from the line of Stephen Grambling, Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","My question actually looks out towards actually 2014 with changes to the broader health care and policy there. I'm wondering if you can maybe talk about how you're thinking about the potential impact from those changes, how you might be trying to mitigate those costs going forward?","David B. Dillon","Well, there's a lot of dimensions to the health care costs. But I would start with first, which is we believe very strongly that our associates need good health care and that we want, whatever plan we do, to give them a health care program that we can be proud of. And we think we've consistently done that for many years. And so I don't really see what we'll be doing in the next couple of years as radically different than what we've been doing in the last several, and that is looking for ways in which we can improve the way in which we handle health care. The biggest change in health care over the last 3 or 4 or 5 years has been instead of trying to cost shift, that is move the cost from an employer to the associate, we've tried to find ways to actually reduce the overall cost. So that if the associate pays say a 70% or so of the health care cost, just as an example, if they pay that -- or 30% rather and the company pays 70%, as an example, if we're in that situation and we can reduce the overall cost of the health care, the associate can save and we can save. And it tends to flatten the increased cost that you might otherwise experience. Now with the new health care law taking effect, that certainly changes some of those dimensions, and it will increase some of our costs and will increase some of our associates' costs. But the overall objective still remains. Rodney, you want to add anything?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, just one small addition and Dave briefly mentioned it. I mean we really are focused on trying to help our associates have a healthier lifestyle and doing things to help support them. And we invest a lot of dollars for our associates to get preventive-type care or physicals, those kind of things because we really want our associates to be able to be the healthiest they can be. And that will help lower everybody's cost, but it'll also help our associates have a better lifestyle.","David B. Dillon","Before we end the call, though, I do want to share some additional thoughts, particularly with the associates that are listening. We appreciate everybody sticking with us today, given the technical difficulties at the beginning.","I have 2 special messages for our associates today. First is we take time to honor our veterans this month in November, and I'm pleased that we support our veterans and military families in so many ways at Kroger. And want I want to thank you for your support in launching, honoring our heroes, our company-wide partnership with the USO. Since 2010, Kroger has raised more than $5 million to assist service members and their families. This has been because of you, our customers and our vendor partners. Your generous support helps fund the USO's variety of programs that benefit our troops and their families.","In addition, Kroger announced Hiring Our Heroes, a renewed commitment to hiring veterans. More than 17,000 veterans have joined Kroger's ranks since 2009. By the end of this year, our human resource team will attend 15 military -- recruit military veterans career fairs, and they plan to attend even more in 2013. As always, we are pleased to welcome veterans to our Kroger family, and we continue to support our active duty military associates who work for us.","My other message for associates is about this holiday season. Because of you, Kroger is the trusted and preferred store for millions of families at this special time of the year. Your enthusiasm and creativity clearly show us -- clearly shows as we visit our stores across the country, and we appreciate everything you do to delight our customers and keep our stores running smoothly. Today, our busy shoppers have more retail choices than ever before. Offering to help somebody find something, keeping items in stock on the shelves, making checkout fast and easy, these are all ways that you can make their day a little more pleasant. So thank you for the hard work during this holiday season.","And while this completes our call today, thank you, everybody, for joining us. To all of you, Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your families. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"12983":["The Kroger Co.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead.","Michael Schlotman","Thanks. Kate couldn\u2019t be with us here this morning, so I will wish you the good morning and thank you for joining us.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you for that.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say all that I\u2019m proud of our associates for their continuing objective and connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter.","As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we\u2019ve said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we\u2019ve had deflation in 30 years; and in previous instances, deflation lasted from three to five quarters in a row. We\u2019re in the middle of the cycle right now, and it\u2019s not fun, still our tonnage continues to grow, our total market share continues to expand, and we\u2019re focused on executing our strategy.","A silver lining of deflationary environments is that, it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining the light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you\u2019re in it, but we\u2019ll be in a position to benefit from changes we\u2019re making today once we\u2019re out of this cycle.","We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates, and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. We don\u2019t change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11% plus an increasing dividend on a three to five-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.","Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we\u2019re seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers\u2019 economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, healthcare cost continued to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next three months. It\u2019s important to remember, this survey was completed in October, and it\u2019s too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.","Natural, organic and health and wellness continued to be a food megatrend, and we\u2019re writing these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continue to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double digit growth. Simple Truth, organic kombucha is a very \u2013 is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health.","We\u2019ve also recently launched a 24 pack Simple Truth Vapor Distilled Water with Electrolytes. It\u2019s priced fantastically. It\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s selling really well. Our produce, fresh prepared and deli packaged departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it\u2019s selling.","A few on-trend examples are protein snacks, such as Simple Truth \u2013 Private Selection and Simple Truth Paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese, as well as hand crafted in real sugar sodas.","As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati four weeks ago, Kroger\u2019s earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last five years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have a $100-plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone.","But good enough today won\u2019t be good enough tomorrow. That is why we\u2019re both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 8451 is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms.","We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores, that is 50 more locations than we were operating just four weeks ago. We\u2019re connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers.","We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We\u2019ve built a strong customer first foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. And doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates, and shareholders.","Now, Mike will offer more details on Kroger\u2019s third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike?","Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and once again good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the Investor Conference, the last two weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results and our IDs came in at the low-end of our expectations for the quarter.","Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined to 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter.","Over the last four quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same timeframe. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales.","By way of comparison, last year there were 19 new stores open that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy\u2019s, and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the third quarter of 2015 grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program.","We can clearly do better and we\u2019re redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our customer-first strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don\u2019t see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products they want, improved service, and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way.","Now, for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.179 compared to $0.238 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling four quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to $0.188 last year.","During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result \u2013 this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy\u2019s, Inc.","At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high-end of the company\u2019s targeted range of 2 to 2.2 times. It\u2019s worth noting that over a longer time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually \u2013 if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring their troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates\u2019 future benefits, as we did in the second quarter.","We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factored in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance sheet amount of our estimate in multiemployer pension plan obligations.","Over the last four quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, paid $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year. Merger with Roundy\u2019s for $866 million and merger with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63%, excluding Roundy\u2019s compared to 14.16% for the third quarter of 2015.","I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed a new contract with UFCW covering Fry\u2019s associates in Arizona. We\u2019re currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina, and we\u2019re also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy\u2019s distribution center.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for associates. Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.","Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates the importance of growing Kroger\u2019s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities, and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year, we narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year is $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company\u2019s commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20","For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. And we expect Kroger\u2019s full-year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel to decline compared to 2015 fifteen results.","Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We\u2019re completing our business plan process for 2017 now and we\u2019ll provide specific guidance in March, as we normally do. We anticipate, both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week.","Net earnings growth will likely be below the low-end of the company\u2019s 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. We expect the operating environment in the first-half of 2017 to be similar today. The second-half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment.","As you know, we define long-term a over a three to five-year time horizon and we\u2019re committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers and will increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike. We are both clear eyed about the challenges before us and optimistic about Kroger\u2019s future. Transitions are no fun, but they do create opportunities to improve the way we run our business. We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers and our associates.","We\u2019ll continue to accelerate our adoption of technology to deliver additional value, to provide convenience for and to our customers, and take costs out, as Mike mentioned. All these things set us up to grow our business. We have a unique opportunity for strong growth in the $1.5 trillion dollar U.S. food market. Our best days are still ahead of us.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Michael Schlotman","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Just one quick question for clarification. I know, you wrote this, but I have received a couple of questions on it. When you\u2019re guiding to the low 8% EPS growth in fiscal 2017, is it reasonable to assume that\u2019s on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the benefit of the 53rd week?","Michael Schlotman","Well, it does exclude the benefit of the 53rd week. Basically, the way we business plan is just like you said like-for-like and then we go in and estimate what the 53rd week will ultimately add to that result. I\u2019m not going to go to \u2013 am I going to be at 8% or 9% with the 53rd week, because that would tell you what we\u2019re thinking about without the 53rd week. But the below \u2013 the only guidance we\u2019re giving is on a 52-week basis, we would be below the 8%.","Ken Goldman","Got it, okay. And then, Mike, I wanted to follow up on CNBC, you were sort of, at least, to my ears talking about maybe deflation having a little bit here, you were pointing to some commodities maybe rising, but you\u2019re also guiding, I guess, to a similar operating environment well into fiscal 2017. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I understood, if deflation is the primary reason for the challenging environment today. And if you think deflation is going to get less bad, then why wouldn\u2019t early 2017\u2019s operating environment be a little bit less bad than what we\u2019re kind of seeing right now?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, what I was going through on CNBC is where some of the raw material markets are trending over the last four weeks. A lot of those when you look at them on year-on-year, they\u2019re still quite negative. But there\u2019s some trend in some of those categories, the input costs over the last four weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn\u2019t mean things turnaround on a dime as raw material input cost change.","There\u2019s usually a lag from that bottom and a slight blip up in those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last two cycles of inflation and deflation we\u2019ve had, and we have a five-year rolling average chart that we look out a lot, and if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to 2002 versus 2009, which was a little bit more persistent, but that\u2019s what\u2019s in the back of our minds.","Ken Goldman","Thanks, Mike.","Rodney McMullen","Yep.","Michael Schlotman","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Steven Forbes","Hey, guys, Steve Forbes on for John today.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Forbes","Good morning. Given the pace of the ClickList and ExpressLane roll out thus far this year and the uptick over the past couple of weeks you mentioned, can you touch on what your thoughts are for 2017 as it relates to these initiatives?","Rodney McMullen","We wouldn\u2019t see at this point sharing specifics, but obviously it\u2019s something that continues to be important and we\u2019ll continue to roll it out. Now, at some point, it will slowdown a little bit just because the stores that are easy to add, we will have added them. We have identified overall how many stores we think makes sense and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s over half of our stores, we think would make sense to have ClickList. But obviously, as you do the easier ones first, and it will slowdown just because of the difficulty getting installed.","Steven Forbes","And then as a follow-up, maybe kind of a bigger picture question about what you\u2019ve seen historically as it relates to the return to an inflationary cycle right, if you think about the competitive environment today, how do you think about 2017, right, if we do get that eventual reinflation cycle after such an extended period of deflation, I mean, do you foresee yourself being competitors rapidly passing through price increases once inflation returns, or in the context of what we\u2019ve experienced in the past and what we\u2019re experiencing now, is there any risk that price increases occur on a slower basis than we may expect?","Rodney McMullen","It\u2019s a great question, and obviously looking back over the last 20 years or so, what do they say every short statements in economics is wrong. So, part of it depends on how does it come back? Does it come back with a vengeance, or is it just 2% or 3%. At this point, we would expect for the inflation, when it becomes inflationary for it to be pretty modest on the things that we\u2019re seeing. But remember, that comment, we\u2019re very early, so that would be a very early expectation. But you don\u2019t know until you\u2019re in it. I think everybody from a competitive standpoint is looking at what\u2019s going on in the market. So typically, you\u2019ll lag a little bit at the front-end, but then everybody will pass it through. And that\u2019s the reason why you\u2019ll always hear me talk about the transition periods are difficult, both going in and coming out of inflation\/deflation.","Steven Forbes","But the pace of increase, and I guess, what do you expect as you look out 2017, is very dependent on where the absolute level of inflation returns to?","Rodney McMullen","Absolutely, right now like on the things that are grain-based, obviously, those crops for the most part haven\u2019t been planted yet. You\u2019ll have some winter wheat that\u2019s in that process. But crops will be a heavy driver of that inflation, and it\u2019s still way too early. I think what in 2016 it appears that this will be a record crop for five years in a row. At some point, you\u2019re going to not have a great weather.","Michael Schlotman","Never had six.","Rodney McMullen","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever had high before it\u2019s done, so you never know. But there isn\u2019t anything that we see out there that would cause us to have a different point of view. Now, obviously, in produce that is \u2013 that will change very quickly depending \u2013 the growing seasons are much shorter there.","Steven Forbes","Thanks, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ed Kelly","Yes. Hi, guys, good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Ed Kelly","So can I just start asking about guidance and just a little bit more color. So at the Analyst Day you reaffirmed full-year guidance. But openly admit it right at the end of Q3 was difficult to judge. Today you ended up lowering the outlook a bit. I guess, what\u2019s changed since the Analyst Day, if you can sort of like provide a bit more detail there? Is it really just the conclusion that the end of Q3 was softer than really what you were thinking? And then how is Q4 shaping up so far quarter to-date on IDs, or are you are you at that point of low, up low single digits?","Michael Schlotman","So if you think about the \u2013 where we\u2019ve been through \u2013 at the \u2013 from the Analyst Day transitioning through that, I would actually encourage you to step back a bit from that and look at it a little bit bigger wins. It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points.","When you\u2019re plus or minus $23 million on a two or three-day timeframe or even $40 million on a two or three-day timeframe, when you\u2019re at 4% or 4.5% idents, it\u2019s a blip on the radar screen. When you\u2019re between zero \u2013 when you\u2019re at between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it\u2019s a huge percentage move in where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a week.","The potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is a very real. You\u2019ve all heard me at different times talk about, if you saw our deli sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen and it\u2019s a big effect. The effect of milk eggs and cheese continues to be a big. It\u2019s a big headwind, tie these sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won\u2019t necessarily give the exact amount, but it\u2019s a meaningful amount, broadly shrugging their shoulders up.","So it\u2019s as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter just those three commodities because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You\u2019ve often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there\u2019s deflation. When it\u2019s deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don\u2019t get a two-year bump in it.","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I would just add a little bit to Mike\u2019s comment. When Mike shared the guidance at our Analyst Day, he did talk about the uncertainty because of the calendar shifts. So there is what \u2013 where we ended up was exactly consistent with what how Mike outlined in terms of the uncertainty for the balance of the few days. When you look at quarter to-date in the fourth quarter, we would be slightly negative. But if you look at last year \u2013 last year\u2019s \u2013 the first four weeks of last year\u2019s fourth quarter were by far the strongest and they kept getting weaker during the quarter.","So we will start cycling numbers from a year ago that look a lot different than what we\u2019ve been cycling so far this year. So that\u2019s the reason why we were comfortable on giving the guidance in terms of been slightly positive for the fourth quarter.","Ed Kelly","Great. And just a follow-up, on the gross margin, I guess, Rodney and Mike, your gross margin in this period of this deflationary cycle, I guess, has been, I guess, remarkably resilient, given sort of like what you\u2019ve seen historically in terms of the relationship between the margin and and IDs. In the competitive environment from what we hear right sounds like it\u2019s more difficult.","Can you just give us a sense as to what\u2019s really going on in the underlying gross margin. I mean, I know, you continually invest in price. But it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re being \u2013 is impacted by the competitive environment as what we\u2019ve seen at other places and any color there would be great and sort of like how would you think about that over the next few quarters as well?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, I\u2019ll make a couple of comments and let Mike finish it. First of all, when you look at having Roundy\u2019s and not having Roundy\u2019s, that affected \u2013 affect some of the year-on-year change, because Roundy\u2019s has the higher gross margin than the Kroger-based Kroger company.","The other thing is that our buying teams have done a ton of work on changing the way we buy product in terms of cost of goods. And if you look, we have a lot of corporate brand products, where we buy direct. So a lot of those changes have really been helpful in terms of making improvement in cost of goods too, which has helped some on the cost, the gross margin line. And then Mike, you \u2013 I\u2019m sure, you have a couple other comments you want to add.","Michael Schlotman","I think the one I would go a little deeper on is the corporate brands. And as we continue to have an expansion of our private selection line, when you look at Simple Truth continuing to grow nearly basically double digits, those kinds of products contain higher gross margins, as well. And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat the historical reference. The numbers are a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of a very complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complexes is corporate brands.","The other thing that\u2019s in there is the fresh mix. You\u2019ve heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foody trends in snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin. Now, their contribution to overhead of their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments, because there\u2019s a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that.","So it\u2019s a combination of all of those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019ve our cornerstone for the last 14 years.","Ed Kelly","Great. Thanks, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Scott Mushkin","Good morning. So I wanted to kind of take a different direction here a little bit and talk more about the non-fresh, maybe even the branded side, the brand at which some of the data coming out lately shown volumes are just negative in the measure channel and also inquire about e-commerce has obviously seen Walmart by Jet.com, Amazon is making some big inroads all of a sudden into some of these consumable categories \u2013 these everyday essential categories. And just in that context get your guys\u2019 perspective on what\u2019s going to happen with margins? What\u2019s going to happen with these categories? And how do you react to an environment it seems to be changing pretty quickly?","Rodney McMullen","Well, there\u2019s about 10 questions within that. So I\u2019ll try to\u2026","Michael Schlotman","So you don\u2019t get a follow-up, Scott.","Rodney McMullen","I\u2019ll try to summarize this in such a way that is helpful. When you look at our relationships with the CPGs, it would be \u2013 our business for \u2013 with most of those CPG partners would continue to grow. And the trends that they would be seen overall for the most part the trends we would be seeing is different.","In terms of, at our Analyst Day, we increasingly see competition much broader than we would have in the past. And we\u2019re really focused on how do we give the customer what they want, when they want it in a way they want it. And Amazon is one way of doing that, but not every customer wants to have 10 boxes of stuff setting in front of their door all day.","What we find is a lot of customers love having groceries picked \u2013 picking it up, and we\u2019re starting to test, obviously, we\u2019re partnering with third parties to deliver. So, for us, we\u2019re really focused on the customer and letting the customer to decide how to engage and doing it in a way that\u2019s seamless.","We\u2019ve always said that we believe margins over time will continue to decline from a gross profit margin standpoint. And that\u2019s the reason why we worked so hard to get costs out, partner with 8451 using \u2013 partnering with our technology teams to fundamentally change the way we do work to get costs up. I don\u2019t know, Mike, anything you want to add.","Michael Schlotman","No, one of the things, I agree it 100% what\u2019s Rodney on the e-commerce relative to deliveries and being on your porch and where we\u2019re situated. Our customers live within two or three miles of the store they most regularly shop in. And it\u2019s extremely convenient for them to order online and make that stop by the store in a way to and from either work with daily activities. And they use this way to see if the retailer is excited about something is are they doing more of it or less of it, and as Rodney said, we continue to roll more ClickList locations out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Sean [ph] on for Karen. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rodney McMullen","Hi.","Unidentified Analyst","Could you guys provide \u2013 hey, how is it going? Can you provide some color on tonnage trends this quarter versus the first two quarters of the year?","Michael Schlotman","The tonnage trends continue to be positive for the quarter. I would \u2013 there was some softening from the second quarter, the third quarter in tonnage. But overall, where we continue to have positive tonnage and we continue to grow our share. And in some of the categories, we\u2019re very pleased with the tonnage growth we\u2019re seeing. It\u2019s \u2013 tonnage is a \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit of a difficult animal to get your arms around, because there are so many pack size changes.","Today, used to be, you bought it, that\u2019s \u2013 while you did buy bottled water and then you bought a 12 pack of bottled water, then you bought a 24 pack of bottled water, now you buy a 32 back of bottled water, all of those are one unit even though we\u2019re selling more bottled water units. And there\u2019s a lot of multi-packs and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity.","You also see some of that with ClickList and categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs, because they don\u2019t have to fill up their bass cart [ph] with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they maybe buying a 12 pack of paper towels instead of four pack of paper towels, because they don\u2019t have to worry about space in the bass cart, it\u2019s just as long as their trunk can hold or that\u2019s okay. We continue to be pleased with our tonnage growth. It\u2019s something we know as the fundamental piece of what it \u2013 what is core to our business.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, my follow-up would be just some color on extra week next year and the impact earnings per share, we went back and looked at 2012 that sort of proxy for that and thought that the margin through it may be equates about $0.09 a share, just wondering if you could give some comments on that?","Rodney McMullen","Well, one extra week out of 52 is 1. \u2013 a little over 1.9%. The gives and takes of that and what happens inside that week drive what the benefit of it is. But historically, it\u2019s \u2013 I would agree that it\u2019s somewhere in that range, but it\u2019s difficult to understand what\u2019s going to happen in the first week of late January early February of 2018.","We do always try to break that out and provide that insight, because we don\u2019t take credit for that extra week in terms of achieving numbers. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we are in the middle of our business plan process and just wanted to give you a little bit of flavor of what we\u2019re seeing next year shape up to be and letting people know that the 53rd week, we\u2019re not taking credit for achieving the numbers.","Unidentified Analyst","All right. Thanks, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Yep. Thanks, Sean.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Zachary Fadem","Hey, good morning, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Hi.","Zachary Fadem","You mentioned several times during the call just a focus going forward on taking costs out. Can you talk a little bit about what this means for things like employee costs, wages, healthcare, store productivity initiatives, pension, stuff like that?","Rodney McMullen","I would say probably all those \u2013 all of the above are things that we\u2019re working on. One of the things that we\u2019ve been able to do over the last several years is through process change \u2013 changing the way work is done. And we continue to see great opportunities there, and we\u2019re really working hard on partnering with our R&D team and our technology team to take things \u2013 to change the way we do work.","And I know, Mike, at our Investor Meeting talked a little bit about temperature monitoring. And temperature monitoring, for example, is something that we developed internally with our R&D team. We\u2019ve rolled it out and it saves about $25 billion a year in terms of just what it cost to execute it, obviously, it takes capital to do that.","So the first year doesn\u2019t create too much value, but the second year and beyond is great value. So labor is always the area where there\u2019s the most opportunity. We will do those savings there through process changes, we think is incredibly important.","Zachary Fadem","Okay. And just a follow-up, I know it\u2019s still early days here. But are there any metrics you can provide on the performance of your ClickList stores? Maybe is there data to suggest that sales are incremental, and do you view ClickList as a potential driver of market share, or rather just an added convenience for your customers over time?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, the \u2013 I\u2019ll try to \u2013 obviously, we\u2019re very, very early. So I won\u2019t be able to answer all of the questions you asked, the great question is just that we\u2019re so early in the process. It would be some growing share and some just one more convenience for the customer. And it\u2019s really a mix of both and each customer would be a different combination of that mix.","What we believe over time is, it starts teaching us how do we deliver what the customer wants the way they want it, when they want it. So we think it\u2019s something that\u2019s even more important than just ClickList per se in terms of teaching us how to connect with the customer even deeper in a better way for them. Some of the business is incremental, it\u2019s a reasonably high range when you look across the company.","If you look at the financial performance, it\u2019s a headwind initially. If you go back and look at some of the original locations that Harris Teeter had before we merged, it becomes where you\u2019re in different whether somebody shops the ClickList or in the store. But the \u2013 if you look at the stores overall, it\u2019s still a reasonable significant ahead in terms of rolling out ClickList from a financial standpoint.","Zachary Fadem","Got it. Thanks, Rodney. I appreciate the color.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Zach.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Shane Higgins","Hey, good morning and thanks for taking the questions.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Shane Higgins","Good morning. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on your ID sales by region. Did you guys see any significant regional differences in ID sales during the quarter? Anything that you could call out?","Michael Schlotman","We always see ID sales ranges by region. When we\u2019re 30 something states plus D.C., it\u2019s like anything else or somebody that\u2019s at the top the list and somebody at the bottom of the list. We typically don\u2019t go into specific geographic descriptions of where we say it\u2019s all relative strength and where we saw relative weakness, if you will, or towards the bottom end.","Broad-based, again, it\u2019s \u2013 I would say, the story is pretty much the same for all the regions with the persistent deflation and their continued focus on trying to drive tonnage is the story that we\u2019re trying to drive home with all of our geographies.","Shane Higgins","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I know you guys earlier in the year, you talked about Roundy\u2019s is being a 30 basis point headwind to the comp, but obviously, going to cycle that in the fourth quarter. Is that, first of all, is that about right? Was it \u2013 has it been around 30 basis points, and as we do cycle that you guys expect that to help contribute to the comp improvement as the fourth quarter progresses?","Michael Schlotman","Yes, if you think about Roundy\u2019s even more broadly than that, it is still in that same kind of a range. We\u2019ve talked about that we\u2019ve gone into 13 stores in Wisconsin and have done those stores the way we want them done and we continue to be very pleased with the sales and tonnage growth inside those stores. We\u2019ve also converted those 13 stores to our \u2013 to the Kroger systems, which for us relative to a merger is lightning speed, because we want to get them integrated into our all of our processes as quickly as possible.","We remain very excited about that merger and the potential we see, particularly, the Wisconsin assets, I think is the, is \u2013 if you will, if you think about it in purely economic terms, is the optionality of that merger getting into Chicago for the cost of the entire merger was a \u2013 was great. And as Wisconsin was Michael Marx and his team running Wisconsin, that will continue to be a very positive thing for us in the future. It\u2019s not going to turn on a dime, it\u2019s a lot of hard work. But the team up there is up to the challenge.","Rodney McMullen","Yes, the one thing that you\u2019ve heard me say this before, the thing that I\u2019ve really been pleased with and Mariano\u2019s and the Wisconsin stores what they can save and cops and Metro are the engagement of our store associates and how part \u2013 how supportive they\u2019ve been, and how excited they\u2019ve been. And the changes that we\u2019re making, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more improvement in tonnage than we are in identical sales results just because some of the changes deflate the retail pricing. But I\u2019m just thrilled and delighted with our teams and the way our teams are engaging and excited about being part of the Kroger team and much much more so than I would have expected this early in the process.","Shane Higgins","All right. I appreciate that color. So just in terms of kind of thinking over the next year or two, this is going to be something that obviously, Mike, you said, you guys have done some conversions, you still have a lot more to go. So this will be something or probably be a multi-quarter effort when we shouldn\u2019t expect to see any significant tailwinds than from Roundy\u2019s over the next couple of quarters?","Michael Schlotman","Yes, it\u2019s clearly something that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re coming up on the one year anniversary of the closer of the merger. I think it was December 18 of last year. So it\u2019s very new part of our book of business. And it is going to be something that over time we\u2019ll continue to be worked on. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I can tell you part of our business plan process is not a tailwind from Wisconsin in 2017, individual stores, yes, but overall no.","Shane Higgins","Yes, thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Shane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andrew Ruben","Hi, this is Andrew Ruben on for Vinnie. I just had a question on deflation. Now bigger picture you characterized being in mid-cycle on. Just curious what drives that characterization and given that you\u2019ve been through a few of these cycles, as you referenced, any color on how the cycle that ran compares to the few you\u2019ve experienced over the past 30 years?","Rodney McMullen","Well, the bigger picture is that, it probably looks the most like the one in 2002, that one really, it was about five quarters. And if you look at when it was the worst just in the middle of it and that\u2019s kind of where we are. Part of it will \u2013 part of it determines why \u2013 I\u2019m trying to think about how to word this in a way that\u2019s helpful.","The cycle coming out will be driven by what cause you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it? Everything that we can see the reason what we would expect today were \u2013 would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it, is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on.","If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven, because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless, there would just be a terrible crop year in 2017, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once and Mike talked about it a little bit like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that to next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you\u2019re cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3, and that\u2019s the reason why the pressures decreases. I don\u2019t know, Mike, anything else you\u2019d want to add to that?","Michael Schlotman","No.","Rodney McMullen","Andrew, does that helpful?","Andrew Ruben","That is. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thank you for taking my question.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Rupesh Parikh","So the first question I had was just on traffic. In your press release, it sounds like in your press release you don\u2019t have a positive household \u2013 loyal households growth. I just want to get a sense of, if you look your tropic this quarter, or this or just Q3, were there any changes versus what you saw in Q2 and I just want to get a sense on how tropic laid off versus your expectations?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, if you look at it versus expectations, it\u2019s pretty similar, it continues to be positive. In terms of playing out, you always want more traffic than you had, but I would have said that every quarter. I don\u2019t know, Mike, from your perspective. I think it pretty well played out the way we would expect.","Michael Schlotman","I agree with it.","Rodney McMullen","We felt like third quarter would be a very tough quarter, given everything that was going on. And \u2013 but you start cycling some of those things as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then for gas margins. I just want to get a sense where your outlook is for the balance of the year? And if you think about where gas \u2013 fuel margins could end up for this year, do you expect to be back at your historical average on the fuel margin line?","Michael Schlotman","Fuel has certainly been a wild ride the last few years and even in the last few even days and weeks is the, is OPEC going to do something, is OPEC not going to do something, and they ultimately did the $32.5 billion or 1 billion gallon decline barrel declines $32.5 million barrel with this good to be on the dollar \u2013 the number instead of the barrel. That equates to 500,000 barrels a day. And to see the wild swings down a $1.51 day up almost $4 the next day is kind of confusing on what\u2019s \u2013 when you look at that relative the worldwide supply of oil is relatively modest amount of production guidance.","That said, volatility \u2013 up and down volatility is generally very positive for us, because we have many, many fuel centers at our supermarket locations that get not just a delivery a day, but some of them get a couple of deliveries a day. So when there\u2019s daily volatility like that, it allows us to take advantage of market fluctuations.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. When we do our business planning process, we always just use a five-year rolling average. We find that\u2019s just close as anything else. I think, Mike mentioned, if you look at over a rolling four quarter to rolling four quarter fuel margins are down just shy of a couple of cents. But for us, anybody\u2019s guess is as good as anybody else\u2019s and I always get a kick out of it.","If gas is at a $100 a barrel, it\u2019s going to $150, and if it\u2019s at $50, it\u2019s going to $20 neither of which have ever been right. But we just in terms of the way we do our planning process, we look at a five-year rolling average. When we look at do our shareholders get a return for us being in that business, we also do the same thing.","Michael Schlotman","We essentially business plan, the non-fuel business had a fuel business on and then, of course, this week more than add the 53rd week on.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks for your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robby Ohmes","Hey, good morning, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Michael Schlotman","Good morning.","Robby Ohmes","Rod, for people like me who were not covering this industry back in 2002, I was hoping you could maybe give us some insights. How does this deflation in promo environment change the way your customer is shopping, or does it like, for example, you called out snacks and drinks, maybe some color on other categories or also does sort of the balance of fill-in versus stock-up change. How does the reaction of promos change in sort of a multi-quarter deflationary environment? And maybe some more color on what happens in center of store when you\u2019re in an environment like this?","And I have to ask, because I don\u2019t think anybody did, but just the question you love getting what\u2019s Walmart doing right now promotionally? Are they investing more and more in price in the markets you\u2019re in? Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Okay. Well, if you look at the 2002 versus today, probably the biggest change from a customer standpoint would be, I guess, would be two things. One, obviously, they buy food that\u2019s already prepared much more. And when we shared everything at our Investor Day, you could see a lot of the changes that we\u2019ve done in terms of having food that you can come to one of our stores and eat at the store, or take home and eat. That obviously is a huge change today versus 2002.","If you look at the things that are and I guess, the other big change is customers shop more frequently, but smaller baskets. So if you go back then and we didn\u2019t have a loyalty card and we didn\u2019t have the analysis we do today. But everything we could find, the customer would \u2013 the purchase \u2013 the basket would be bigger on an individual basis, but if you look at a monthly basis, it\u2019s bigger today.","In terms of the cycle comments, the things that we think are the same or more the materials and raw mat ingredients-based, where if you look at, yes, beef and pork and chicken the biggest component of that is corn price. And chicken that cycle is much quicker than it is on pork and beef and that hasn\u2019t changed now versus 2002.","So it\u2019s really what\u2019s the raw materials themselves and how is the growing crops doing and how does that flow through the supply chain and that would have the biggest effect on some of the proteins and some of the center store components. I don\u2019t know, Mike, on inflation anything that\u2026","Michael Schlotman","I think you\u2026","Rodney McMullen","Both of us were round in 2002, as well. We had different jobs.","Michael Schlotman","I think you covered the landscape where you did I didn\u2019t.","Robby Ohmes","And then maybe guys just on, if you think back to 2002, I don\u2019t know if you can remember. But in terms of promotionally how the competition reacted, has that changed a lot? Is it \u2013 is there more in-store signage, or is it more circulars, or what are the promotional tactics that that are being used right now there and is it similar or different than 2002 from the competition?","Rodney McMullen","Well, on the promotional stuff, the \u2013 you would, in 2002 and this is going off of a lot of memory without having the data in front of me. But competitors then didn\u2019t have as much insights. And they didn\u2019t know if it was just, because somebody was getting their sales, or if it was deflation.","Today, people have a much better data. So they understand its things that\u2019s going on in the overall marketplace, it\u2019s not some competitor getting the business. So all of us reacted in a different kind of way and it\u2019s a front-end of deflation back then, because you thought a competitor was getting the business.","Michael Schlotman","That parallels Rodney\u2019s comment on basket size. Historically, all we would see is, what\u2019s the average transaction per customer. And if that\u2019s softening back in 2002, when you didn\u2019t have the data, you didn\u2019t know that that household was coming more times on a monthly basis and wound up spending more with you on a month, because we simply didn\u2019t have that technology back then.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And just quickly, Walmart, any color on any changes in their level of price investment?","Michael Schlotman","No, it would be similar to what we seen before in terms of our comments. As you know, we won\u2019t talk too much about specific competitors. We have a ton of respect for them, there\u2019s no doubt, they continue to improve. But that\u2019s the same comments I made at the Investor call and I made at the last quarter. And all of us would have different approaches in different regions of the country.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Michael Schlotman","Okay.","Rodney McMullen","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And our last question will come from William Kirk of RBC. Please go ahead.","William Kirk","Thanks, everyone. So I\u2019m still a little confused about the end of the third quarter, if ID sales have been running at essentially 0.5 with two weeks left and finished at 0.1, does that imply the last two weeks were down 2%? And then taking the calendar commentary, does that imply Halloween sales, or sales associated with Halloween are down two banks to moving from a weekday to a or moving from a weekend to a weekday? Thanks.","Michael Schlotman","Yes, I don\u2019t know, if I\u2019ll get that precise in answering the question, because daily fluctuations are always dangerous because of things like you cited Halloween moving between days. I don\u2019t think we said that, we were absolutely at the low-end of our 50 basis points to 150 basis points ID guidance, we said we were near it. And it actually, in our original guidance for that, we expected that the third quarter to not get to the low-end, but the fourth quarter to be above the low-end to bring us inside that range. And we didn\u2019t end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it\u2019s maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people were hearing that we\u2019re near the low-end just assuming that that you\u2019re at the low-end.","I go back to, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you\u2019re in this range, if I missed \u2013 if I missed those four days that were left by $20 million, that because my ID sales and half of it was a 20 basis points, from a 4%, it goes to 3.9% and it\u2019s not a very big deal.","William Kirk","Okay, that clarification is very helpful. Thank you.","Michael Schlotman","Yep.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, William. Before we end today\u2019s call, I\u2019d like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Being part of millions of family celebrations this holiday season is a great honor and privilege. Our customers count on us to have what they need and more and you make it all happen.","Just last week nearly 10.5 million customers shopped with us on Tuesday and 13.5 million on Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That\u2019s incredible, a huge thank you. No matter where you work, you make the holiday special for our customers, our communities and each other.","I also want to thank our store teams for their outstanding response to our National Hiring Event in November for all military veterans and family members. We hired 4,000 veterans and family members in one day, which is nearly 3,000 more than last year\u2019s event.","We are delighted to welcome them to our Kroger family, as part of our continuing commitment to active-duty troops and the nation\u2019s 23 million veterans.

We appreciated the opportunity to share with you our strategy and to give you a chance to hear from other members of our senior management team.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Hopefully you saw our announcement earlier this week that Cindy Holmes has been promoted to Senior Director of Pension Investments. I wanted to take a moment to thank Cindy for her service in Investor Relations. Both Mike and I appreciate Cindy's efforts these past several years, which you know have been exciting and transformative years for Kroger. We know she'll continue to contribute to Kroger's success in her new role.","I'd also like to introduce Kate Ward, who has been promoted to Director of Investor Relations. Kate joined Kroger in 2001, and has held a number of leadership roles in our audit and finance departments. We hope you'll join us in welcoming Kate to her new role.","We often say that Kroger's success starts and ends with our more than 400,000 associates connecting with our customers every day. Our third quarter results are a terrific example of our team's ever-deepening connection with customers. We achieved our 48th consecutive quarter, i.e., 12 consecutive years, of positive identical supermarket sales growth with very strong ID sales of 5.4%.","We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling four-quarter basis, and we continued to manage costs so that we can continue investing to grow our business for the future while delivering today. Based on Kroger's strong third quarter performance, we are raising our identical supermarket sales guidance and our net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year.","During the third quarter, we contributed $80 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last four years to help stabilize pension benefits for our associates, while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.","In January 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan by working with the union to consolidate four multi-employer pension funds into one. This agreement protected pensions already earned and provided greater stability for future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates. In June 2014, we announced similar agreements with two additional multi-employer pension funds.","All of these steps reflect our strategic decision to increase certainty of pension benefits for our associates. These are examples of how we identify opportunities to use our financial flexibility.","We are very excited about our pending merger with Roundy's. We have filed our tender offer documents, and while we wait for the conclusion of that process and regulatory approval, I simply want to reiterate how much we are looking forward to welcoming Roundy's team to the Kroger family of stores.","The economy overall continues to slowly improve, and customers continue to feel more optimistic, but the bifurcation in the economy remains. Some customers are willing to spend more while others are worried about their job or next paychecks are more focused on saving. We find that all customers want quality products and a great shopping experience.","For the customer who's more focused on natural and organic products, we have our own Simple Truth brand. We also have many entry-level price point items of excellent quality. For customers looking for incredibly high quality products like Boar's Head or Murray's Cheese, just to name a couple, we have that too. Our job is to understand and deliver for our diverse set of customers so that they can save where they want to save and splurge where they want to splurge.","Finally, before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to note that there is an important global dialog taking place that underscores the positive role businesses can play in sustainability. Kroger's team has been making progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operations.","For example, our stores and manufacturing facilities have made significant progress by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. In five years, the number of stores recycling food waste has increased 73%, from 290 to more than 1,000 this year. 30 of our 37 manufacturing plants are sending zero waste to landfills, an increase of nine facilities since 2013. Taken together, along with a lot of other efforts, Kroger is sending 69% less waste to landfills than we used to, and we will continue to work toward zero waste.","This is only possible due to the thousands of individual activities our associates are doing on a daily basis. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live, and they have helped Kroger earn a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This is obviously something we are very proud of.","We look forward to sharing our new five-year sustainability goals, with an eye toward pushing even faster and having more accelerated progress in the near future. As you can see, we have a lot going on at Kroger. I am thrilled with our financial results and what we are doing for our associates, our customers, our communities and shareholders.","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter results, provide an update on labor relations and an update on our guidance for 2015. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone. I'd like to echo with Rodney's comments relative to Cindy and also welcome Kate to the team. First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.","Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. As Rodney noted earlier, we are very pleased with our 5.4% identical supermarket sales growth in the third quarter. It reflects the underlying strength of our core business and our associates' growing connection with customers.","Identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of very strong tonnage growth, plus an increase in both the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household in the third quarter. As you know, our goal is to grow the number of loyal households at a faster rate than the number of total households who shop with us. I'm happy to report that we continue to meet this goal, quarter after quarter.","All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, during the quarter, with our deli and produce departments leading the way. We continue to see outstanding, double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department.","Our second metric is FIFO operating margin without fuel. Several items are excluded from our third quarter rolling four quarters calculation, specifically the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items, the contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, and the contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2014 and third quarter of 2015.","While items like this occur over time, we feel it is important to report how our operations are performing. On this basis and without fuel, FIFO operating margin increased 18 basis points in the third quarter.","Our operating margin has expanded more than our goal, largely due to a combination of two factors; first, continued stronger than expected ID sales; second, the continued incremental investments we are making in our Customer 1st strategy are being made in a sustainable way based on insights from 84.51. This is not a new normal for operating margin expansion, but rather a demonstration of our diligence in how and when we invest.","Return on invested capital, on a rolling four quarters basis, was 14.16%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because of last year's third quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase from fiscal 2014. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.","Before I share our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current inflationary environment. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the third quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.1% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. We saw inflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all deflationary. We continue to see inflation in pharmaceuticals.","Now, I'll share our third quarter results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable influence that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the third quarter were affected by the low retail price of fuel, much like in the first and second quarters. The average price of fuel during the third quarter was $2.30 compared to $3.22 last year.","Total sales in the third quarter increased 0.4% to $25.1 billion, compared to $25 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.","In the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $428 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $362 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, including a $0.02 benefit due to certain tax items. Excluding this, Kroger's net adjusted earnings were $345 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. These numbers don't sum due to rounding.","Kroger recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the third quarter, compared to an $85 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We have lowered our full-year LIFO expectation to $75 million, from $90 million previously.","The FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 4 basis points from the same period last year.","Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage core operating expenses as a rate of sales in the third quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, a $25 million contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third quarter of 2014, and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW Pension Plan in the third quarter of 2015, decreased 23 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the last year.","Third quarter FIFO profit, excluding fuel and the adjustments I mentioned just a moment ago, increased approximately $66 million over the prior year.","Now for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.238 compared to $0.232 in the same quarter last year. Fuel results have been more difficult to predict than normal. We did not expect fuel margins to remain this high this late in the year. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is a moderation in margins. Volatility in weekly fuel costs remains high and where those costs end up will influence our fourth quarter results.","Corporate brands' performance during the third quarter was strong, representing approximately 27.7% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing rate, setting a record high for total sales in the third quarter, while continuing to establish all-time weekly sales records throughout the quarter. Our newest brand, HemisFares, has been embraced by foodie customers, so much so that we are currently working with our Sicilian Gelato supplier to expand capacity while maintaining the best-in-the-world quality of the product.","I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We ratified contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Denver and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. We are currently negotiating a contract with the UFCW for store associates in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates.","Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Kroger's long-term financial strategy is to use its financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders. Maintaining its current investment grade debt rating is the cornerstone of this and it allows the Company to use cash flow to take advantage of strategically and financially compelling opportunities and to continue its fill-in strategy, repurchase shares and fund the dividend, which is expected to increase over time.","Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters. During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 853,000 common shares for a total investment of $31 million.","Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities, totaled $832 million for the third quarter, compared to $681 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities, to slightly exceed $3.3 billion for the year.","We continue to see a strong pipeline of high quality projects and are encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects.","The Company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.99, compared to 2.27 during the same period last year. We expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to remain under 2.2 upon the close of our Roundy's merger transaction. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion, compared to $11.5 billion during the same period last year.","As I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters, investing $3.2 billion in capital on a rolling four quarters basis, plus an additional $160 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to bondholders and shareholders while creating opportunities for our associates.","Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for the remainder of 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $2.02 to $2.04 for fiscal 2015. The previous guidance was $1.92 to $1.98 per share. This range exceeds the Company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that's expected to increase over time.","As with our third quarter results, the performance of fuel in the fourth quarter will determine where we end up in the range. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 4% to 4.5%. As we said in our press release this morning, that implies an annual guidance range of approximately 5% to 5.25%.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered another spectacular quarter and marked our 12th consecutive year of positive quarterly identical supermarket sales growth. When you achieve such consistently remarkable results quarter after quarter, it's easy to take them for granted. In fact, we have spent the past few years investing in our unique and multifaceted business model, which we believe has been a key driver of our success.","We continually strive to innovate for our customers while delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. At a time when so many other retailers are facing very difficult circumstances, Kroger continues to stand out from the pack, thanks to our incredible associates.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. I apologize. Mr. Heinbockel's line has dropped from the queue. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","This is Judah on for Ed. Congrats on the quarter and congrats to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. First just wanted to ask about the Q4 comp guidance, is that an indication of where you're running Q4 to date or is there just some conservatism built into that given that you're early on in a big quarter?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at so far, and obviously it's still very early in the quarter and we're cycling very strong numbers a year ago, we would be at the top end of the range that we provided. So it really isn't trying to be conservative, it's just reflecting the fact that we're cycling some incredibly strong numbers, and inflation continues to get a little lower.","The other thing that you never know is how is the weather going to flow. Obviously snow is helpful for the business and that you really can't predict at all. And then as Mike just mentioned to me, this year we will not have a Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. A year ago we had Super Bowl in the fourth quarter.","Judah Frommer","Okay, that makes sense. And then touching on the gross margin performance, I mean you have lapped Harris Teeter fully now and we still don't see a lot of investment in margin. And maybe Mike referenced it in that you're doing good work with 84.51, but is this kind of a new normal, like a less than 10 basis point investment in ex-fuel gross margin?","J. Michael Schlotman","I'll hesitate to give what a normal is for an investment because we do continue to make investments in price in a variety of areas of our store. I'd say it's a reflection of prudence on how and when we make investments. Additionally, the mix, when you look at the strength of brands like Simple Truth, when you look at the strength of natural and organics, all of which have a little bit higher gross margin, that certainly plays into the overall mix of business. But if you were to look at gross margins by department, I have a little bit different view of exactly how and when we invest. But we will continue to invest not only in price but all four keys of our Customer 1st strategy.","W. Rodney McMullen","And we continue to have strong growth in our fresh departments and most of the fresh departments have higher gross as well.","Judah Frommer","That makes sense. Okay thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from William Kirk of RBC.","William Kirk","So you have a very good data analytics and targeted marketing, so I was wondering what are you seeing in terms of available promotional dollars and how they are being allocated in-store versus out of store, and I guess the question is kind of for the industry and more specifically if it's any different for you at Kroger?","J. Michael Schlotman","Obviously we really don't know what's going on across the industry because we only know what's happening for us. What we are trying to do is work with our CPG partners, and we really do view them as partners, and what we're trying to focus on is how to grow their business and grow our business, both. And it's really trying to make sure that we effectively spend that money that they provide to us that we then in turn provide to our customers. So it's really taking that data and helping our CPG partners to most effectively spend their money. So all I can do is talk for what we are doing. I really don't know what's going on in the industry.","William Kirk","Okay, thank you. That's all for me.","Operator","Next we have a question from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Congrats all on another great quarter and also congratulations to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. I think most folks were pleased with the results and the outlook and it seems like you might be taking somewhat conservative approach because of things like fuel gross margin, inflation and weather, so wondering if you could run us through some of the puts and takes in the fourth quarter, and more specifically what type of fuel gross margins are you baking in?","J. Michael Schlotman","When you look at the puts and takes, as Rodney said, weather is often difficult to predict. Last year actually was a pretty favorable weather event for us. Not only did we have the Super Bowl right at the end of the fourth quarter, we also had a fairly large snow event in the Midwest at the end of the fourth quarter, and both of those served to have some pretty strong sales that very last week of the quarter.","As I said in my prepared commands, the ability to predict fuel margins this year has been more difficult than I can remember since we've been in the fuel business, which is really since 1983 when we merged with Dillons Company. It's not just where weekly retails and supply and things like that wind up, it's really the day to day volatility of fuel in the open market because we don't have fuel contracts, we buy everything in the open market.","And frankly, we feel very good about where our core business is going, the day to day runnings inside of our store and the ability to predict that and the strength of our ID sales as we noted with the guidance for the fourth quarter. Where we wind up in the $2.02 to $2.04 will be wholly predicated on where fuel margins wind up for the quarter.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. And then as a follow-up, what are you sort of expecting in pharmacy margins, and also, I don't know might be too early, but any color on 2016 puts and takes as well?","W. Rodney McMullen","On pharmacy, it continues to be tough, as it's been all year. And there's obviously a ton of change going on. And what we really remain focused on is making sure we're helping our customers. We have a great team of friendly and knowledgeable professionals that will help our customers get healthy quicker and it eliminates one stop somewhere else.","When you look at overall, we feel like we have very strong business model, and it's also the nice thing about having such a diverse business when you look at across all our lines, that we can make investments in pharmacy, but when you look at the total business, it continues to perform well.","Relative to 2016 guidance, I'll say a couple of comments, Mike, and if you want to add anything, but we'll give the details in March. We have a meeting where we review our objectives with our Board, and that obviously we're not going to share things publicly until the Board is in concert with what we're doing.","Couple of comments just to remind everyone, and it really ties back to some of the things that Mike and I have already said, fuel margins, we would expect to more normalize. And if you look at inflation, we would expect it to continue to be less. But when you look at overall, and this isn't just for 2016, but our long-term objective remains to grow earnings per share by 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend, and that's the long-term objective. And then we'll give more detail in 2016.","Alvin Concepcion","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Erica Eiler","This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Just following up on your inflation comment just now, just curious if you have any specific expectations for Q4? And then specifically next year, I mean you mentioned you expected to go lower, I mean any thoughts with regards to how we should think about generic drug inflation for the upcoming year?","J. Michael Schlotman","Generics continue to have a good amount of inflation in them. Really don't see anything as we look into 2016 that would necessarily cause a moderation. Part of that was driven by prices have gotten so low, some folks got out of the manufacture of those products. With good old supply and demand and just basic economic forces, if underlying costs for those continue to be high, at some point other folks will get back into the manufacture of that business and perhaps put pressure on that economic cycle.","Relative to inflation for the fourth quarter, our view would be it would be in the range of where the third quarter was, in the low 1s, and as we look into next year we would certainly expect full year inflation for next year probably to be comparable to where inflation is for this year. We don't see a lot out there in the overall supply chain that would cause us to be different.","Erica Eiler","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to your loyalty program offering, I mean we've seen a number of the specialty grocers recently discuss plans for new loyalty programs with different propositions for consumers across each. Clearly Kroger has had success with fuel points in recent years. I guess I'd just be curious, how often do you tweak the value proposition with your loyalty card offering, how important is the points part of the offering versus maybe some of the other components that your program offers, any thoughts that you could share there would be really helpful?","J. Michael Schlotman","We would look at our loyalty program as not tweaking. What we do is we continually use the insights to improve what our customers get, and it's based on how customers react. So it's constantly using what customers actually do to try to do a better offer for our customers on a personalized basis. And the examples you gave would just be small parts of what the overall loyalty offering is for a customer. And the key for anybody doing it is how do you make it worth something the customer finds of value.","Erica Eiler","Okay, great. Thanks and best of luck for the rest of the year.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short","Cindy, we'll miss you. And Kate, look forward to working with you. I just wanted to follow-up, go back to 2016 on a higher level. I guess can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the Medicare Part D component, because I guess the color would be the reimbursement rates could come down fairly meaningfully, and so I realize that could be maybe a bigger headwind for you in 2016. Obviously gas margins are a wildcard, but then as I think about maybe tailwind for 2016, Roundy's accretion could be a bit more of a tailwind than you've guided to. Inflation is kind of neutral. Any more color you could give on any of those?","J. Michael Schlotman","As Rodney said, we're not going to go too far down the path of talking about 2016. Clearly the litany of things you laid out, it's almost as if you have the draft of our business plan Board book that we're getting ready to take up at the end of the month and send to our Board about the topics we will discuss with them in January. All of those are on our radar screen. We are putting all of those into the mix as we decide what 2016 is going to look like with our Board. As Rodney said, we're committed to the 8% to 11% as the long-term earnings per share growth target, and it just wouldn't be, whoever either he or I, if we want to be on the March call, to get out in front of our Board with talking about 2016 much more.","Karen Short","Okay, that's fair. And I guess just looking at the O&A growth rate this quarter excluding rents and depreciation, I guess when I look at the last three quarters, it's been pretty consistent kind of in the 5.5% range, and I realize for next year Roundy's is going to impact that number, but is that kind of \u2013 do you think that's a fair run rate to look at on a more sustainable basis?","J. Michael Schlotman","5.5%? I missed the first part of your comment.","Karen Short","It seemed to be that you've been kind of consistently in that 5.5%-ish range for the first three quarters of the year. So excluding what Roundy's might do to that number, is that kind of the right run rate to think about on a more sustainable basis, because I know we had talked about there were some investments in services and things like that, that you were making because you knew it would drive sales, so I just kind of wanted an update on that?","J. Michael Schlotman","I actually haven't calculated exactly what our OG&A growth has been and I don't know if you've taken out the one-time items from those if you look at our core business. Our rate of sales is \u2013 and whether you're doing it with or without fuel. Our ongoing \u2013 if I look at it without fuel, it's actually under \u2013 year to date it's actually under a 5% increase, and that's including the pension contribution in there.","We look at those service investments the same way we look at price investments, and we step back and we have a very defined plan and a very diligent plan of what we expect to do in departments and how we expect to make incremental investments in all four keys of the Customer 1st strategy. And some of those are price, which become more obvious because of the gross margin calculation.","Other of those are a little less obvious because when you look at things like service that can get drastically covered up, the whole idea of adding service in some of these departments would be to grow sales, and that's how they wind up getting paid for. So overall, we would expect to continue to drive operating costs down and use that as part of the fuel for the engine to continue to invest.","Karen Short","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan.","Ken Goldman","Cindy and Kate, congratulations on your new roles. Two questions from me. One, a little bit of a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier, but a lot of the CPG companies, especially on the packaged food side, companies like Kraft, they are running that 3G playbook, they are talking, they are very vociferous actually about how they're trying to get off that promo needle get much more about baseline sales. I'm not talking about any particular vendor, but are you seeing any evidence that that's actually taking place where a lot of your larger food vendors are perhaps getting a little bit less aggressive with [peel-backs] [ph] or is it really not affecting anything yet from your view?","W. Rodney McMullen","I will answer the question that will partially answer your question. What we find is CPG companies, we deal with a lot of different CPG companies, and any point in time you will have different companies with different strategies. And we have a team that will work with CPGs based on the strategy that they're playing. What we find is when CPGs raise prices when it's not economically driven, our corporate brands always picks up market share, and it's one of the values of having an incredibly strong corporate brand program is that when there's something that doesn't make economic sense, the customer understands that. So at any point in time, probably almost any comment you would make on a CPG, there's somebody out there running that playbook, and each one would have their own playbook.","Ken Goldman","Okay. That's actually helpful, and you know what, I'm going to leave it there and thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Wanted to ask about your \u2013 you gave some helpful commentary around the macro environment and kind of the puts and takes of the consumer spending behaviors, and if we try to in the sense kind of reconcile that with your natural organic, your corporate brands specifically of course continue to tick up, what are you seeing as you're looking at your loyalty data? Have there been any notable changes in terms of kind of categories or products that are going into the basket more or less, and I guess in turn are you changing the way you're maybe space allocating in any way that might be helpful to share with us?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at \u2013 there's constantly changes going on in the basket and it's not so much new, but if you look at the fresh departments, that's been a trend that's been ongoing for a long period of time and isn't slowing down at all. The things that you took up, mentioned on natural and organic, that as well. We look at space allocation, it's something that is really important to do on an ongoing basis. And one of the examples I always like to give is coffee. If you asked me three years ago or four years ago what I thought was going to be the future of the coffee category, I wouldn't have been very positive. Today because of innovation by Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain, it's completely created a different type of growth in that category and we are continually adding spaces on what's inside the store because the customers want it, and it's something that is driven by innovation. So the change in allocation is more driven by innovation than probably anything else, and how the customers react to that innovation.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow up, just on Roundy's, just checking, does it still look like the deal should be closing before the end of this calendar year?","J. Michael Schlotman","As Rodney said in our prepared comments, we filed our tender offer and we filed with the regulators and it's pending both of those coming to a closure.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Next we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Two questions, one just on the inflation. I thought the commentary about produce is inflationary and meat, seafood, deli, et cetera, deflationary, Mike, I think you've made comments in the past about there's good deflation and bad deflation, and so as you're looking into fourth quarter and then into the 2016 overall inflation being similar, can you maybe speak to the components, sort of how inflation is playing out right now if you guys think that produce is still inflationary, sort of the same dynamics? And then remind us if these are better dynamics than other ways to get to this sort of lower level of inflation? And then, if you can, maybe just weave in what you're seeing in the competitive environment right now, is it same, worse, better?","J. Michael Schlotman","Relative to inflation, overall it continues to be a mixed bag, and particularly when you look at the fresh departments like produce, like meat, like seafood, produce in particular, it generally bounces around a lot during the year. When you see dramatic inflation in produce, it's not a good selling season because it's been bad growing for whatever region it is that's there.","Earlier in the year when we saw a lot of dramatic deflation in produce, it was driven by two things, one, last year's first quarter was relatively strong inflation, and then this year you had a good growing crop. So you're really back to a more normal kind of a crop for produce. And actually if you look it on a two-year basis, the first quarter last year and the first quarter this year, combined they were slightly inflationary. So it's more of a normal. While the fourth quarter was inflationary, it was just slightly inflationary.","Meat obviously has gotten a lot of headlines as having been so high for so long. High prices clearly did what supply and demand do. High prices, over time people stopped eating as much meat and whether it's beef or chicken or pork. That means supply picks up a little bit, and guess what, prices start to come down. And if you look at on a \u2013 if a two-year stack on something like inflation makes any sense at all, we are still net higher than we were a couple of years ago, but still well down from the peaks of last year.","So it's a mixed bag. We think things like that are going to persist into 2016. The wildcard is always exactly where this pharmaceutical inflation is going to be and it has been very, very high for really the last couple of years.","Relative to the competitive environment, I don't think there's a time that Rodney and I have been doing these calls together that we haven't talked about this being a highly competitive industry. Barriers to entry are low. Our job is to go out every day with our more than 400,000 associates and deliver a better value proposition to our customers today than we did yesterday, and that's solely what we're focused on.","Sure we keep an eye on the competitive environment. There are a lot of people out there trying to sell what we sell and our job is just to do it a little bit better every day and win that customer every day when they wake up and make sure they want to come to Kroger.","Robby Ohmes","Great. And just a quick follow up, could you guys give us a quick list update on those, I think it was 19 non-Harris Teeter stores, and how that's progressing?","W. Rodney McMullen","It's still something that we are still early in the test. We continue to roll it out for customers. Some customers like it a lot and it's just one more reason to shop at Kroger.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","So I just wanted to get back to something you mentioned on the gross margin, which was the mix shifting. I wanted to get your perspective on kind of what inning we're in on that mix shift? I mean obviously you've got fast growing categories like private-label, Better-for-You private-label, you have the fresh categories. I do believe you guys are in the process of updating your prepared food area as well, which tends to have a lot better gross margins. So as we look out, and this is really not next year or it's really more of a three-year outlook, it seems to me that this mix shift should remain and maybe even accelerate, and it'd be helpful. Am I off base on that?","J. Michael Schlotman","Scott, it's a phenomena that continues, and to say what inning we would be in on the changing needs and desires of the consumer would be, it will probably be short-sighted on my part and I would be absolutely wrong. We certainly do a lot of predictive analytics with data we see not just inside our stores but overall in the economy, trying to figure out where the consumer is going.","It clearly does seem as though there's going to be persistence and shift to a more healthy lifestyle and maybe out of some of the traditional center-of-the-store categories into more fresh categories. But I would tell you there are plenty of center-of-the-store categories that now have natural and organic offerings in a can, whether it's our own Simple Truth brand with spaghetti sauces and salsas and things like that.","If you go down the dog food aisle, the growth in the dog food aisle is in grain-free and natural kind of dog food, so even our pets are jumping onto the bandwagon of leading a healthier lifestyle. Everybody is laughing at me in the room by the way.","But it's something that our job is to make sure we're there to deliver what the customer wants when they want it, and we will certainly stay on track with it in trying to predict where the customer is going. I don't think I'll get into that, but we're happy with our overall offering, we're happy with our continued growth and thrilled with the team we have working on not just the center-of-the-store and keeping it to healthy and [vibrant] [ph] category, but all the fresh departments around the perimeter of the store as well.","W. Rodney McMullen","Scott, you have followed Kroger for a long time, and you know one of the things that we try to do is make sure we design our business model so it's successful regardless the environment and try to really play to what's going on in the environment. And some of those examples, that's what's going on now, but customers change and we try to make sure that we stay nimble enough to be able to react to those changes.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, perfect. And then I actually had a question. At the Analyst Day, you guys laid out a very compelling case about market share and how that drives returns over time, and that one of the big growth drivers you've seen for Kroger is taking some markets that maybe are a little bit below where the ideal share is and driving them up. As I survey your business, one of those areas seems to be the mid-Atlantic and Southeast that happen to be with Harris Teeter. How do we think about those areas geographically and what you can do to maybe get the market shares up over 20% to really drive some handsome returns?","W. Rodney McMullen","Other than at the Analyst Day, we did give specifics on one market. We won't make it a habit of giving specifics. So we really do look at across all of the opportunities. When we merged with Harris Teeter, one of the things we talked about was one of the reasons we were excited about merging with Harris Teeter was the opportunities that they had in several of the markets that you mentioned. We're equally or more excited today about that opportunity going forward as when we merged with Harris Teeter. So beyond that, I won't get into any more specifics on a market other than as we outlined, we see this as a long-term opportunity across a lot of markets.","Scott Mushkin","So densing up would definitely help you guys in those markets?","W. Rodney McMullen","It would help us in most of our markets.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, as we have long said, the higher our market share, the higher our ROA in a particular market, and that's really the cornerstone of our fill-in strategy is increasing the number of markets with that high correlation.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","Steven Forbes","It's actually Steve on for John today. As it relates to the capital development program, is there a focus on speeding up the pace of investment here I guess to capitalize on some opportunities, or should we still assume the $200 million of incremental spend annually looking out?","J. Michael Schlotman","Again, I won't get into what our guidance is for 2016, but we do continue to have a great pipeline of projects and are very encouraged by our early projects. We will continue to grow capital as we go into 2016 compared to 2015. The $200 million is a number that I would say for the next several years we would increase capital by at least that amount. Keep in mind, as I increase capital or I increase my base, my store base and the number of stores, I also have to increase maintenance capital a little bit to keep those stores fresh over time. So it's not just an allocation, a new allocation to new stores, I'm going to have to make sure I continue to take care of the base operations as well.","W. Rodney McMullen","And part of the thing that Mike talked about on speeding up, it's really our real estate teams, our facility engineering teams, our division teams and our attorneys are working together to take time out of the process on how long it takes to get a store open. So it's really everybody working together actually taking weeks out of construction time which is causing some of the acceleration of capital investment.","J. Michael Schlotman","Right.","Steven Forbes","And just a follow up, as we try to figure out the impact here of the development program, can you try to remind us of I guess the normal comp maturation of a marketplace or the maturation of the store level EBITDA margin?","J. Michael Schlotman","When you say the normal comp maturation, what do you mean?","Steven Forbes","I guess the store opens at an initial productivity of 70% or so. I mean what is \u2013 year one and year two, there's going to be a benefit on the comp side. Do you see a pretty significant ramp both in comp and profitability at the store level?","J. Michael Schlotman","Clearly when you open a store, the first 6 to 12 months of that store opening with all the preopening costs get expensed on the day you open. It takes a while for that store to turn block on an EBITDA standpoint. It doesn't become a comp store until the fifth full quarter that it's opened, the way we do IDs. So it's a while before they contribute to IDs.","In some markets as we dense up, you have the potential to have a little bit of sister store impact. So from a total sales standpoint, you are getting exactly what you wanted from an ID standpoint in a particular geography. You may have a little degradation in a particular geography from their ID sales as you dense up in a particular market. Now some of these markets, our market share is low enough where that won't be as big of a deal, but we continue to monitor that as well.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andy Wolf","On the ID sales, I want to compare them to Q2 because it was kind of the same number, both for the [print] [ph] and for the inflation. So I think I recall in Q2 you said it was very much volume driven, and I'm not sure you said that here, I think I hear you talking a little more about mix. Should we take away from that that number has a better mix element this quarter than last quarter?","J. Michael Schlotman","It was heavily driven by volume again, very strong. In my prepared comments, I said it was a combination of very strong tonnage plus an increase in the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household during the timeframe. So it's a combination of all of those.","W. Rodney McMullen","But tonnage was very strong.","Andy Wolf","Okay, good to hear. So there is no real update on mix, if sort of the bifurcated message continues?","W. Rodney McMullen","It really is the same thing that continues to play out, but now it's playing out on top of years where it played out. So it's growth on top of growth.","Andy Wolf","Few more follow-ups. On 84.51, you've been asked about it and you pointed to it, can you maybe call out some areas of the marketing where it really is helping, where you used to sort of you need promotions but is it also in pricing, and I know you've been asked about allocation, but could you give us a high level there as to where it's currently, is it helping the business more than has maybe as we're used to hearing about? And also, when you announced the split from Dunnhumby, you said you could probably work with some or are excited to work with similar companies. Any update there would be helpful as well.","J. Michael Schlotman","On working with other companies, that we wouldn't share at this point, other than saying that that's something that is part of what we are allowed to do now and we work against that. On helping more than the past, one of the things, even some of the examples that you gave, just by continuing to learn and continuing to be more integrated, we're making progress on top of where we were.","So to me the biggest improvement and change has been in the meetings now, the 84.51 team is part of the same meeting. So you're not having a discussion and deciding what to do and then going back and sitting down with 84.51 to say, okay, here's what we want you to do. It's actually everybody in the same meeting and their insights to say, you're thinking about this but it's probably better if you think about it this way. And it's really the professional insights and experiences that's helping us accelerate where we are versus necessarily just doing something new.","And in the past, while we owned half of them, they would have not been always around the table initially because we did only own half of them and they had obligations outside the Kroger world as well. So you had another follow-up?","Andy Wolf","Yes, just real quick, on the $80 million pension contribution, I assume that was contemplated in your guidance either for the quarter or for the year. I just wanted to double-check that.","J. Michael Schlotman","It is contemplated in the guidance in the $2.02 to $2.04 for the year. Those are things that with some of the strong fuel margins rather than that happening a little bit every so often, we've taken opportunity to put the money in when we have that tailwind. It gets the money into the fund and they can start putting it to work faster than if we did it over time.","Andy Wolf","Thanks. And I also wanted to just congratulate Cindy on a great job these past few years.","J. Michael Schlotman","With all these accolades for Kate and Cindy, I'm going to have to warn Kate that the glow goes away pretty fast. We have time for one more question.","Operator","And that last question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania","I'll just reiterate, good luck to Cindy in the Pensions, and just wanted to ask a question about relative price gaps. I feel like everywhere I turn in the industry, someone's telling me just how aggressive you're being with price. Our studies show something similar. And your gross margin is just holding up remarkably well. You talked about the mix. But I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you feel about your relative price gaps, do you think you have maintained them, widened them, what do you think the plan for next year is?","J. Michael Schlotman","If you look at longer-term, we've always assumed that markets will get more competitive, and that's been part of our business model really starting, they've caused us to start that years ago and it's something that we just [indiscernible] changing at all.","The gap, I guess I would word it a different way, you're always trying to get better but you are proud of where the progress you have made, and it's something that's very important for us to be able to make sure that we're giving our customers a better deal. Price is one element of that but service is just as important, and we're focused as much on that in terms of fresher product and better service as well. And all of those things together is what we think creates a unique model for Kroger and is driving a lot of our success.","Kelly Bania","Great, that's helpful. And then just a question on the pension contribution. It seems like, and I don't know if I'm thinking about this the right way, but when you have this very strong gas margin environment that generates a little extra cash and earnings, you kind of offset that with these kind of one-time contributions, is that the right way to think about that in terms of how you plan for these? And then just what is the status of the consolidated UFCW plan at this point?","J. Michael Schlotman","The status of it is it's in great shape. Cindy will make sure it stays that way. We did joke internally that it was her going away present from IR to the Pension Group, but that wasn't. These funds will need money over time. Our enrolment in these plans continues to grow. Folks continue to earn benefits. We have a great investment strategy, but they do require funds over time, and while we would budget them in to be made at different points in time, as I said earlier, when we have the opportunity and a little bit of tailwind and a few extra dollars in the coffers, we feel it's prudent to go ahead and put that money into the fund, let the fund put that money to work as quickly as possible to generate the return and continue to have strong benefits for our associates.","Kelly Bania","Great. Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen","Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As I said a few minutes ago, Kroger's consistent, outstanding results are easy to take for granted. The fact is, your hard work in our stores and facilities every day makes it all possible. Your commitment to our customers brings our Customer 1st strategy to life. In large and small ways, each and every day, what you do makes these terrific results possible.","The holiday season is such a special time of the year in our stores all over the country. You help millions of customers every day prepare for celebrations at their schools, offices, churches, homes and more. Thank you for your hard work to make the holidays brighter for each of them.","You also make it a season for giving by working with Feeding America, the Salvation Army and other local community partners who help work with us to donate food and other items where they are needed most. Thank you. And thank you for being part of our big Kroger family. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays to you and your family.","That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12993":["The Kroger Co.

We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings.

In addition, please save the day for our 2019 investor conference, which will be held in New York City on November 5th. Further details will be shared soon and we hope you can join us.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Let's meet today to review Kroger's second quarter 2019 results, it's Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Kroger is focused on executing the second year of our Restock Kroger plan to generate shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has four main drivers, redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value. We are halfway through the second year of our three-year plan.","We continue making strategic investments to reposition the Company for the future, while continuing to grow and deliver today. We started this conversation the last two quarters by acknowledging we had our work cut out for us. As always, we remain energized by that challenge. While we're always continually driving for improvements, there are several examples in our second quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus of Restock Kroger blueprint is paying off. Guided by our customer obsession, Kroger delivered our best identical sales results since the launch of a transformational plan. Our internal customer measures are improving even faster than our identical sales growth. There is always a lag between improving the customer experience and when the customer will reward us.","Some other positive trends during the second quarter include FIFO operating margin that was stable and our supermarket business excluding fuel and pharmacy. 15 of our divisions had increasingly -- increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel, compared to the first quarter. We continue to reduce cost. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We continue to make significant investments to redefine the grocery customer experience. We are building a platform of seamless experiences to serve customers, anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want.","We know the seamless experience is essential to the customer experience both today and tomorrow, which is why we continue to invest heavily in our capabilities in this area. Kroger's digital sales grew by a solid 31% in the second quarter. Pickup and delivery sales growth continued to perform in the mid 30% during the quarter. Going forward, we expect our digital sales growth rate to moderate year-over-year, primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the ship customer of our other digital offerings like Vitacost. Vitacost remains an important part of our business in our growth and ship is in part thanks to what we've gained from their platform and talent. We've also expanded our digital coverage area to reach 95% of our customers. This means that 95% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick and mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.","Importantly, we are starting to see improving operating profit trends in our digital business. Our digital business is becoming less of a headwind, which is an important inflection point as we continue to invest in new capabilities to support our transition to seamless.","However, I do want to note this is still a significant investment for the Company. A great example of partnering for customer value is our continued rollout of Ocado sheds. In July, Kroger and Ocado announced plans for a new high tech customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia. What's so exciting about Ocado is that their model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model.","So not only will sheds accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities, but also in how quickly the Company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. Ocado's technology team of over 1,400 software engineers brings a huge depth of talent and a long track record of innovation to growing opportunities in online grocery retail.","We also announced an expansion of our relationship with Walgreens to a new test area in Knoxville, Tennessee. Starting this fall, 35 Walgreens stores in the area will feature a curated selection of Kroger's popular Our Brands products like Simple Truth, America's largest natural and organic brand, along with national brand products. Kroger's Our Brand sales grew 3.1% this quarter, retail and unit share growth led to the highest second quarter share in Our Brands history. We also introduced 203 new Our Brand items during the second quarter.","Our customers favorite new items key food and flavor trends we predicted and then shared with our investor community last year at Investor Day. And those new items delivered more than $137 million in incremental sales during the second quarter. Further bolstering our supermarket business. We were thrilled to share the news last week that Kroger is leading the way with the widest assortment of plant-based protein among US retailers through our Simple Truth brand. We continue to see progress in our alternative profit streams with media and Kroger Personal Finance as the primary growth drivers. Gary will share additional commentary on the progress of our alternative profit streams in his section.","Now, moving to talent development. As we've previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's talent development investments, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger by supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investment and wages, training and development.","Feed Your Future is our industry-leading education assistance program, continues to build momentum. Among all the participants more than 85% are hourly store associates. Since inception of the program last year, we've distributed 3,000 awards totaling $5.1 million in education assistance. In addition to continuing to develop talent internally, we continue to recruit talent from the outside, especially in the areas of digital, technology and supermarkets. Increasingly, customers, associates, stakeholders, and US investors are choosing who to partner with based on a purpose and values. We were pleased to see the Business Roundtables recent announcement acknowledging that businesses have a responsibility to be a positive influence on society. Kroger has always been focused on being a trusted partner in communities and committed to social purpose.","In the second quarter, we were proud to publish our 2019 environmental, social and governance report, reflecting our efforts across the Company to be environmentally responsible and a positive influence on society. The report detailed progress on Kroger's Zero Hunger\/Zero Waste social impact plan, as well as our 2020 sustainability goals. Other items highlighted in the report included our 9% reduction in food waste generated by retail stores. We achieved a 13% improvement in supermarket food waste diverted from landfills, moving from 27% diversion in 2017 to 40% in 2018. We reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 9.1 million pounds so far, well, on our way to achieving our 10 million pound goal by 2020.","I will now turn it over to Gary for more detail into our quarterly financials. Gary?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the Company for the future through Restock Kroger. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.44 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas in our business that were particularly robust. Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the second quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plans.","The alternative profit businesses achieved budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. And our fuel performance was strong, helping mitigate pharmacy gross margin, LIFO and tax headwinds in the quarter. LIFO charge for the quarter was $30 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year, driven by a higher than expected inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%, compared to 18% in the same period last year. These two factors combined represented a $0.5 [ph] per diluted share headwind in the quarter compared to last year.","As Rodney mentioned, Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.2% during the second quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched our transformation plan. Several departments outperformed the Company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, produce and natural foods. We were also pleased with top line momentum in our pharmacy business and experienced mid-single-digit increase in script counts. Overall, we are pleased with sales progress in the quarter and we will continue to work to build on this momentum in the second half of the year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $626 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the second quarter in 2018. Gross margin was 21.9% of sales for the second quarter. FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel decreased 29 basis points from the same period last year, primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business. Retail supermarkets, excluding fuel and retail pharmacy saw a 12 basis points of gross margin investment.","Based on the needs of the business, we are focused on balancing margin investments and capturing cost of goods, sourcing savings and operational efficiencies to offset these investments. As a great example of this focus, our associates have done an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the second quarter compared to last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement. OG&A costs as a rate to sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 14 basis points. This was achieved through continued focus on execution of Restock Kroger initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions. We always look for opportunities to improve free cash flow and ROIC, important metrics to Kroger shareholders.","During the quarter, we accepted a substantial offer to some unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time. Kroger used to gain from this transaction as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the UFCW company pension plan, helping stabilize associates future benefits. The net impact of these transactions to EPS growth was neutral. As we have previously shared, fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discounts at the pump.","The average retail price of fuel was $2.71 this quarter, compared with $2.85 in the same quarter last year. Retail fuel profit came in above our expectations for the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.35, compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the second quarter. We now expect fuel to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year than originally anticipated. Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance will be the primary drivers of growth this year.","Kroger precision marketing continue to build momentum in the quarter increasing engagement to over 300 consumer packaged goods companies and they experienced a 90% retention rate along with significantly higher spend. Kroger Personal Finance also saw growth in line with expectations during the quarter, as we successfully expanded the number of customers and the frequency with which customers utilized these products. And now for an update on labor relations. We ratified the new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky and Nashville, Tennessee during the second quarter. We also reached a tentative agreement with the UFCW covering 17,000 associates in our Ralphs division in Southern California earlier this week.","We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland and Seattle. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.","We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Our financial strategy is to use our strong free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow, to reduce the Company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5.","Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.3 billion and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.46 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2.59 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range and as we start to operate consistently within that range, we will explore options for returning additional capital to shareholders. Earlier this year, Kroger increased the dividend by 14%, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases.","Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. We are pleased with our second quarter progress and are maintaining full year guidance for 2019. With pharmacy gross headwinds expected to continue in the second half of 2019 and as we lap a particularly strong OG&A performance in the third quarter of 2019 -- 2018, we now expect EPS to be flat in the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we lap discrete items from prior year and continue to build strong momentum with our alternative profit streams.","I'll now turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Gary. As Rebekah said earlier, our Annual Kroger Investor Day is coming up in New York on November 5th. As Gary just mentioned, we reconfirmed our 2019 guidance for identical sales, excluding fuel, adjusted EPS and adjusted FIFO operating profit, as well as reconfirmed that we are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We want to be clear on today's call that we are not reconfirming the three-year $400 million in incremental operating profit expectation. In November, we will give detailed 2020 annual guidance.","I do want to highlight that we do expect to deliver FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. We've outlined a handful of key goals for our Investor Day and would like to use this opportunity to provide you with a preview. At Investor Day, we plan to reinforce our commitment to the overall framework of our Restock Kroger transformation plan, sharing what has worked well and what has not worked well, thus far. We intend to do a deep dive into our supermarket business, which underpins the redefining grocery customer experience pillar of Restock Kroger.","November 5th is the appropriate forum to be deliberate and to allow the experts on our team to spend the proper amount of time with our financial stakeholders to explain how we are thinking about Kroger's business model and how to measure the shareholder value created by Restock Kroger. Several of our Senior Executives will give detailed updates on our progress against the key metrics in our supermarket business and our momentum, as well as how we think about it going forward. We will reiterate the ongoing successful results behind our asset like margin rich alternative profit businesses. We will also talk about the continued strength in free cash flow since the announcement of Restock Kroger, which enabled us to get back to within our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range earlier than expected.","In addition, we will share our views on the business as we look further out beyond to 2020, where growth is expected to continue. I've said it many times before, transformation is incredibly difficult and that's the journey we are on with Restock Kroger. As we reflect on this journey, we want to be transparent about what went according to plan and what didn't go as anticipated. Some things are coming to fruition, as we expected, but just later than we thought, such as identical sales momentum. Some things were unanticipated, such as the lower gross profit margins in the pharmacy business that the entire industry is experiencing.","Things we did expect and that are going even better than we thought, include productivity improvements and cost savings. Over the course of a three-year plan in today's retail environment, there are lots of puts and takes. That said, I want to reiterate that Kroger is committed to FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. The Restock Kroger Transformation journey sets the Company up for long-term growth, looking forward and the benefits we have seen thus far have helped Kroger in our transformation from grocer to growth the Company. We have the right overall strategy and framework for this business and look forward to telling you more about it in November.","Now, Gary and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning and thanks for taking my question and also congrats on this quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Rupesh Parikh","I guess on the top acceleration, if you can give some more color in terms of whether you saw improvement in traffic or ticket? And also, what do you believe contributed to the top acceleration during the quarter?","Rodney McMullen","As I mentioned in the call, in the prepared remarks, it was broad based across most divisions. The area that we saw the biggest year-on-year improvement is average spend per item. Customers continue to go upscale and buy bigger product sizes. We also saw continued improvement in loyal households in terms of the numbers and the frequency of their visits. The other pieces to me that I was especially proud of our team is it's broad-based and it's really using our data to connect with customers on one-on-one.","Gary Millerchip","Rodney, maybe if I could just add a couple of things. I think what we're seeing, as Rod, you mentioned in the prepared comments, too, is many of the elements that we shared in the early part of the year around the accelerators that we expected to helps improve the trend in ID sales as we headed through the year have certainly started to show through in the metrics that we look at. So as you will recall, we talked about as we start to lap the heavier price investments from last year and the space optimization changes that we made in -- predominantly in Q2 and early Q3 last year. As Rodney mentioned, as we're seeing the customer metrics that we look at internally and continue to execute better on starting to show through a trend and improving sales performance.","And while we -- as we shared on the call and in the press release, the absolute digital sales growth was a lower rate that was already an adjustment for the Home Chef purchase a year ago and when you look at click list and home delivery, they're still performing very consistently and driving significant growth. And I think we see all those components continuing to build and certainly in the way that we looked at the year and expected Q2 and Q3 and beyond to play out, we're seeing a lot of those elements that we expect, it's starting to show through in the results.","Rupesh Parikh","Great. A quick follow-up question. Any color you can provide on the quarter-to-date trend?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at quarter-to-date, obviously a year ago there was a hurricane that affected a couple of our divisions in a meaningful way and we're in the middle of that -- middle that happened a year ago. If you exclude those two divisions, we would be slightly ahead of where we were in quarter two, but it's just slightly. And I excluded those two divisions just because until we get through the total cycling, it's really hard to say exactly where we'll be. But continue to progress.","Rupesh Parikh","Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Rupesh.","Operator","The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel","So Rodney, curious, your take on the pharmacy business right, where it sits today. Obviously it looks like a fair bit of pressure on EBIT margin, how transitory you think that is? And when you think about that business long-term, I know you've always wanted to kind of own that customer because of the loyalty factor. Do you think about ways to do something with that business to alleviate the pressure on the P&L?","Rodney McMullen","The one point you made, I think is incredibly important. If you look at the pharmacy customer, that customer is incredibly loyal to Kroger and when you look at their total spend, it's a fantastic customer to have. When you look at the pharmacy business overall, it continues to be very, very profitable relative to the assets invested and obviously year-on-year there is headwind, but when you look at the total business, it still continues to be a strong business.","The other thing is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job on -- two identifying opportunities to build the business, which obviously you get a flow through benefit of that and significant operating changes to take costs out of the business. Now, taking costs out of the business mitigated a meaningful part of the gross pressure, but still, there's more things to be done on taking costs out and process changes. So, when you look at the business overall, I'm incredibly excited about the progress we're making, but looking forward, I think it's still a critical and important component of our overall business strategy.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thanks. And then secondly, when you think about the Ocado rollout, right, one much pressure on 2020. I know they won't open until '21, but probably little pressure on '20. But then secondly, do you yet have sort of an ideal budget for the Ocado progression right from day one it opens, the shed is unprofitable by some amount and the time to profitability is ex number of months or quarters. I know it's a theoretical, but have you been able to get your arms around that?","Rodney McMullen","Well, I would say we have an estimate on expectations on that. And it would be different depending on whether it's an existing market or a new market. And if you look at our budget expectations in a new market, it would take longer for a ramp of profitable -- to profitability versus an existing market where you can move volume over on day one. The modeling that we've done is really using the experience Ocado has had in their ramp ups in England and adjusting it for, traffic patterns in the US, locations of our stores, location of customers and labor rates and those types of things.","Obviously, until you get a facility open, you don't know whether to follow those assumptions are correct. We would typically expect that facility to be somewhere year two to year three before it gets to profitability. But, that is -- time will tell. But the best of our estimates and best of the experience that Ocado has had. The other thing that we're hoping is if you look at each facility Ocado has opened, it keeps -- it gets better on a ramp up than the prior one. And one of the nice things is that Ocado will open up a facility in Canada that will be able to learn from as well, plus the learnings they've had. And that's the one piece that we haven't included in the budget is the fact that they keep getting better.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Gary Millerchip","The other piece to mention, and you referred to in your opening comments as well, as we're learning a lot more as we continue to see as customers evolve digitally engaging with us and so we have a clear model in our mind of what our expectations are, but that model continues to evolve as we learn how customer behavior changes between delivery to home, between pickup at the store, and really making sure that we're optimizing the efficiency and the innovation from Ocado to really support the whole digital ecosystem. And I think that's going to take us more exciting as we think about how the way the customer is changing and how Ocado can meet those needs in the future as well.","Rodney McMullen","And Gary, just implied and I talked about it in the prepared remarks, Ocado is significantly more efficient than the way we're doing it today.","John Heinbockel","Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Kelly","Good morning. Rodney, I wanted to ask you about 2020, and I know you talked about -- that you're thinking grow FIFO operating profit. You didn't want to give a lot more detail, but I was hoping that you could provide some additional color around the key drivers to that? And then I also wanted to ask, because, you've pulled guidance now, which is okay because no one thought you were going to get there. But you've also introduced uncertainty to investors, because we don't know what you're thinking. Is there some minimum expectation that you could at least speak to today to help us out in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 and where this business is going?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, a couple of comments, as you mentioned. We'll get to a whole lot more detail in November on all the pieces and we'll also talk about 2020 and beyond. If you look at the key drivers, it would continue to be identical sales growth. Obviously, managing our gross profit margin, we continue to find a lot of cost opportunities, everything from process changes to cost of goods, the goods not for resell. And in fact, one of the things that we're identifying there is -- there's a longer stream of opportunities than what we did even originally expected as part of Restock Kroger.","On the guidance for 2020, that was the reason that I made the comment that we didn't want to be clear that we expect 2020 operating profit dollars to grow over 2019 provided guidance, just to make sure that people understood that we do expect a growth. We're in the middle of the process and that's a process, normally, we wouldn't finish until March of next year when we would give this next year guidance. We are accelerating it till November because we think it's incredibly important to do that. But, we are in the process on specifics. We did want to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect growth.","Edward Kelly","Just a follow-ups on it, so from a gross margin standpoint, your gross margin ex fuel pharmacy kind of flattening out, can we expect that to continue over time? And then secondly, at your leverage target, historically, you've been very good about returning cash to shareholders, particularly through share buyback when your stock is perceived to be undervalued. Could that be a larger portion or could that be a larger initiative next year?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks for the follow-up questions. This is Gary. I'll take them in the order that you asked the questions. On gross margin, certainly we do continue to invest in price and as Rodney mentioned, there are significant offsets in the investments that we're making in the way that we're managing cost of goods as a team. And over time, we expect, as we've shared, as we reclassified alternative profit, that will also become a tailwind that offsets investments and helps gross margin as well. So while we certainly believe that price investments are such a critical part of the strategy, we do expect it looks different from what you would have seen in 2018 and 2017 in terms of a level of investment, when you look at the [indiscernible] that we have for 2019 and the rest of the year. As you know, we use our data and insights to really understand what's important to the customer and we're continuing to make sure we're price right on the products that matter most to the customer, both from everyday pricing and from the way we personalize the offers through using the data that we uniquely have available to us, because 96% of data is tethered to a loyalty card.","But we also know from customer insights that it's not just about price and ultimately our customers decide to shop at Kroger because certainly of value, but then also the quality of the products, the personalization that we can offer through our data and the freshness and the experience and so we do feel good around the plan for the rest of the year as we head into 2020, around how we'll manage those levers. From a free cash flow perspective to the second part of your question, I'd really just maybe reinforce a couple of the comments that we made in the prepared remarks that you should certainly expect Kroger to be continued to be focusing on how do we maximize free cash flow for the value of our shareholders. We are now about within the range. It's important to us that we demonstrate, we are consistently back in the range because there can be some volatility in our retail business and we want to make sure that we've delivered on our commitment to operate within the range, but certainly now that we're there and we expect to continue to generate free cash flow, we will be looking very closely at what's the most effective way to return capital to shareholders.","Edward Kelly","Okay, thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Lasser","Good morning. It's also a follow-up on 2020. You mentioned that your cost takeout and your productivity and issues are doing better than what you previously expected, but obviously for you to back off some of your prior target, there are things that are not going as well as you anticipated. So, can you give us more detail, whether it's your ID sales growth, the market being tougher than you expected, the alternative profit stream on each of those different levers, can you give us more detail on what's not going as well as you expected?","Rodney McMullen","Sure, yes. A couple of those tie back to what we talked about before, but the pharmacy obviously is at a different level than what we expected when we did the original expectations just in terms of markets change -- structural changes, that's happened to everybody in the industry. Obviously, identical sales made progress -- are making progress, but it's taken longer than what we expected. If you look at alternative profit, it continues to be ahead of what we expected and continues to grow strongly and in November, we will get more details on all of those and productivity and process changes and cost opportunities, we continue to see a big pipeline for those and even more than what we originally expected. And just to remind everybody, we're taking over $1 billion a year of costs out of it to operate the Company.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up Rodney is, when you put together this plan, you had some assumptions about the competitive landscape, both from bricks and mortar players as well as the emerging digital threat. How is that the overall market environment relative to where you thought it was going to be? Is it, presumably, given that you're backing off some of these target, it's probably a little tougher than you anticipated? Is that fair?","Rodney McMullen","No, I would -- when you look at the competitive environment overall, I would say it's pretty similar to what we thought at the time, the pharmacy would be the exclusion to that, that I mentioned. But when you look at the new operators in the market, we assumed that it would continue to be important. We've been proactive, especially since we merged with Harris Teeter on making sure that we create a seamless experience and have a strong digital offering. And I always tell everybody, job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer; job two is, we'll figure out how to make it profitable and we're indifferent whether somebody shops digitally with us or in a store. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks this quarter, we actually saw that headwind was less in the second quarter, year-on-year from a digital standpoint. So when you look at overall, I would say we would say pretty much what we expected. Pharmacy is a little different. And we knew that there would be a transition period that we needed to transform the Company, which is what drove us behind the Restock Kroger commitments.","Michael Lasser","Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Judah Frommer","Hi, thanks for taking the questions and maybe just a couple more follow-ups here. I think, like Ed said, it's not a big surprise that the guides pulled. Can you clarify if it's just the operating profit piece that's pulled? Is the free cash flow guide still intact or is everything gone?","Gary Millerchip","Hi, Judah. Thanks for the question. So as Rodney mentioned, we really plan to give you far more detail in November and we felt it was really important that we committed to doing that in six or seven weeks from now to be out to provide all the color. We still have obviously a huge confidence in the level of free cash flow that we're generating within the Company and continues to be a strength this year. I do think we would want to provide additional guidance on that alongside, as Rodney mentioned our future financial strategy and how we create value for shareholders at the November meeting.","Judah Frommer","Okay. That's really make sense and kind of in terms of what hasn't gone right versus what has, I would imagine that this quarter gives you more confidence in kind of the go forward process, ID is above to gross margin ex fuel and pharmacy down in the low double-digit range. Is part of the -- I would say pulling or pushing out operating profit dollar growth to perhaps, beyond 2020 is part of that getting back to a more normalized supermarket operating environment and delivery of supermarket operating income growth and can we expect that kind of this quarter and the guidance for the next couple quarters is indicative of what you think a normalized level is?","Gary Millerchip","We'll get into more details in November. But a couple of comments I would add to your comments. And I mentioned it in that first quarter earnings call, if you look at the things that we measure internally in terms that have the feedback, customers give us somewhat kind of experience, we're giving them. What we find is that there's always a lag behind identical sales and when the customer tells us we're doing a better job. And when you look at the second quarter, we certainly felt like that was a reflection of that and we continue to improve the experience. I want -- to get into a lot more details on it, I really think we're probably better off to where we have a lot of time in November, where we can go line by line. But I do think it was important for everybody to understand we do expect 2020 to have operating profit growth over the '19 confirmed commitment.","Judah Frommer","Okay. If I could just squeeze one follow-up. Is there a way you can address maybe market share in the quarter relative to your market share trends over the last few, I mean Q2 is certainly well above of industry scanner data?","Gary Millerchip","If you look at market share overall, we would say basically it's flat. It's within -- it's probably up or down a smidgen, but I would say we're not satisfied, but it's moving in the right direction.","Judah Frommer","Okay, thanks.","Gary Millerchip","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Robbie Ohmes","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, two questions, you know, Rodney or Gary. The continued rollout of delivery and pickup, can you give us some help thinking about the shape of that impacting your EBITDA margin? Is it -- do you get to a point later this year or next year, where you start to anniversary pressures and you see alleviation from the pressures of that rollout? Any kind of help on that would be great? And my second, I just want to follow-up on the sorry the dry grocery inflation commentary, is that -- is that something that's building momentum? Is that CPG company pressure? Is that something that, you know is a tailwind for IDs in the back half and maybe into next year, that would be helpful as well? Thanks.","Gary Millerchip","Thanks, Robbie. So on digital, first of all, we are certainly continue to be very excited around what we see in the way that customers engage with us differently as they start to become more of a -- Rodney referred to as a seamless customer, where we're delivering for the customer both -- whether it's delivery to home or ship to home. And everything we see about the way that customer engages more deeply with us shows the value of that overall relationship across all the channels of store and digital working together. I know we've shared before that when we look at [indiscernible], we see a significant [indiscernible] from the customer when they fill that first basket. It's a much higher basket and a significant part of that stand is incremental. And then over time, we also see customers actually move to a position where their visits in the store actually increase as well as they overall build our loyalty with us.","And so you're right Robbie, it's very much a maturation curve, if you like. So we monitor every store and every vintage of the business that goes through that maturation of launching pickup and launching delivery to home. What we see is that curve where -- by about year two, year three of the customer engagement in those stores, we start to become really agnostic around how the customer is shopping with us because of the instrumentality that we see overall in that behavior and how they're more loyal to Kroger. So as we're starting to come through that maturity curve, that's really what Rodney was referring to when he mentioned that we start to see digital as less of a financial headwind in Q2 this year and then into the second half of this year, because we're really starting to see the maturation of that business, partly the customer behavior obviously accelerating, but also because we don't have the same startup costs and the same investments in launching those services.","So we certainly expect that to continue and we are very focused on how do we maintain and accelerate the growth of customer engagement through digital. We were pleased that we had a continuation of digital household engagement growing again during the quarter, and that's very much a focus for us. As we continue to grow their loyalty and we get past that maturation point. As Rodney said, it's still an investment overall for the business. So where we get even more excited when you think about the technology with Ocado and the opportunity to automate some of the back-end operation, if you like, providing those services, because that has the potential to significantly shorten the path to profitability as well when you think about the way the customer shops with us seamlessly overall.","Robbie Ohmes","So would you say, Gary, that the peak EBITDA margin pressure from the rollout of pickup and delivery has been passed? And we just passed it this quarter?","Gary Millerchip","That's essentially what we're seeing overall within the way we look at our digital business and the way you look at that custom maturation. That's right. That's kind of what Rodney was referring to.","Rodney McMullen","And Gary -- I agree with Gary's point, and we also continue to invest in ship and some of the other components as well -- that is a high start-up costs, but that's even reflected in the numbers that Gary has talked about.","Robbie Ohmes","Great. And then just on the -- sorry, the inflation outlook for dry grocery and what's driving that?","Gary Millerchip","Sure. Obviously, we deal with the question of CPG partners addressing price increases all the time. It's something that we deal with others on a case by case basis. And we feel we're in a particularly strong position to really understand what's happening there because of our own brand products and the way in which we can have those conversations to make sure that the price increases are legitimate cost increases coming through to us. Certainly, as we share, we are seeing our range for the year on inflation was we were assuming it would be somewhere between 0% to 1%. And what we're actually seeing in a couple of those categories that I mentioned in the prepared comments that we're slightly ahead of that range. We continue to obviously manage to try and mitigate those through cost of goods opportunities, and certainly where we do see the price increases coming through and we believe they are legitimate we are looking to pass that on to customers where it makes sense. And like you always do in the competitive environment.","Rodney McMullen","The other thing Gary, just wanted one edition that I think is always important to remind and we always remind our CPG partners, if they're raising costs more than the market's going up, our own brands always gains share. And it's an incredible strong quality product. Obviously, it's something that has been part of Kroger for a long, long time. And we continue to even be add more innovation in the lines in terms of the Kroger brand itself private selection and simple truth. So anytime a CPG adds -- changes cost versus what the market is doing from raw materials, what happens is Our Brands gain share as well. And that's also something I think it's important to remind everybody.","Robbie Ohmes","Great. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Robbie.","Operator","The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Gary Millerchip","Good morning.","Karen Short","Hi, I'm just curious. So back to the 2020 goals, I mean, obviously, you gave a pretty detailed answer on what was a little tougher. I think pharmacy stands there and ID is obviously taking a little longer. But fuel has obviously been a much bigger tailwind for you. So -- and I guess that hasn't changed. That's been the case. Fuel continues to be a tailwind for you. So I guess what I'm curious about is what really changed from 1Q when you reiterated the 3.5 to today?","Gary Millerchip","Thanks for the question, Karen. Certainly from a field perspective to kind of cover the first part. You're absolutely right from an overall performance of the business this year.","We feel the fuel business has continued to demonstrate great strength and for us, it demonstrates that the sort of value we believe in the diversity of the portfolio of businesses that we now have. Obviously everything is built on the foundation of food and that frequency of shop and the way customers are engaging with us and the loyalty data we create. But when you think about food alongside healthcare, the fuel margins that we\u2019re generating are now alternative profit streams.","We feel good about the way it allows us to manage through some of these changes as they -- as we see them that are outside of our control and particularly in the case of pharmacy headwinds that we referred to earlier on the call. As we talk around 2020, as Rodney mentioned, we do want to make sure we provide you with a lot more color at the November meeting, around how we're thinking about the growth in the business. I know Rodney has obviously already referred to a couple of elements around areas of the business that we've learnt a lot. And as you alluded to in your comments, we've shared, I think very openly that we embarked on a major transformation for the Company, which involved transforming the experience in the stores and digitally that involve standing up to a number of new businesses around alternative profit streams and taking a dramatic amount of cost out of the business.","So, I think a lot of what we've been learning as we've shared, is that as we get smarter and better in understanding how all those pieces come together and the speed at which they will deliver, the benefits that we're expecting to Restock Kroger, we thought it was important to have to share with you today that we do believe that will deliver growth next year and operating profit over the confirmed guidance for 2019. And that we want to make sure that we spend the appropriate amount of time in November, really taking you through what's worked, the areas where we believe we still have opportunity to improve and how we see 2020 fully shaping up.","Rodney McMullen","And 2020 and beyond as well.","Karen Short","Okay, that's fair. And then I guess looking at the results this quarter, given obviously, again, strong fuel, I get core down 30-ish -- 31% in Q2. And I think it's fair to say that some of that is not within your control because it is pharmacy related. So wondering if you could just get me -- give some color as to whether or not that number is kind of consistent with where your numbers shake out? But also, maybe if you could parse out what the actual pharmacy, both specialty and regular pharmacy might have done in terms of pressuring the core?","Gary Millerchip","Yes, I think that the best guidance we can give Karen will be just refer back to a few of the points that we shared and the release and some of the comments that we made. Rodney mentioned it, from a supermarket perspective, when you take out fuel and retail pharmacy, essentially the operating margins were relatively stable. The pharmacy and the Kroger specialty pharmacy business were obviously a meaningful headwind during the quarter because of some of the industry headwinds that we see overall. But when you look at the investment in gross margin of 12 basis points that we shared around the supermarket business, excluding retail, pharmacy and fuel, and then the 14 basis points of OG&A benefit that we saw in the quarter, that's kind of really where I think is the best kind of data we would point you to give you a sense of what's going on in the business. And obviously, the gross margin, excluding fuel gross margin investment was 29 basis points. You've only got a sense of the disconnect, if you like, between what the health business impacted the quarter versus what the core retail gross margin investment was excluding pharmacy.","Karen Short","Okay, thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Sorry, we just have time for one last question.","Operator","And that question will come from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, it's Tom Palmer [ph] on for Ken. Thanks for squeezing us in. Just a couple of quick one's for you. First, you called that hurricane as a tailwind a year ago for the third quarter. I mean, is there going to be some offset in the southeast, just given what we've seen with maybe people stocking up for Dorian?","Rodney McMullen","Dorian was -- helped a little bit, but not to the same degree as the hurricanes last year hit that center. And if you look in terms of just timing, the next three or four days will look altogether different because when the hurricane actually hits, then you have stores closed and customers aren't able to get into our stores. The thing about, as you know, on hurricanes, you never know when the next one's going to hit. And what we always strive to do is to make sure that we're ready there in advance for our customers. We support our associates and we're there as soon as it's safe to be back. We get our stores back and open and operating and we'll have our associates will go to whatever store they can get to, to work versus their home store. But anything at all, as soon as it's safe, we understand where a central component of a community and make sure we're there for them. So it's -- I would say Kroger is at its best when there's events like this, happens in terms of supporting communities and people.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for that. And then you've alluded to kind of the ability to look towards share repurchases again. Is that contemplated in your guidance for this year or would that essentially be upside if you go that direction?","Rodney McMullen","At this point, we really haven't made any decision on repurchases for the balance of the year. And if there was anything, it would be extremely modest. As you know, we are -- we just now got back into the range. As Gary mentioned, we want to make sure that we're judicious and not -- and look at cash flow as it's being generated and balance all the pieces. So at this point, I think it's a little early to say. I don't know Gary, anything you want to add to that?","Gary Millerchip","I think that's right, Rodney. Certainly, we're actively looking and making sure that we're maximizing free cash flow. But at this point, we want to make sure we were consistently within the range and as soon as we feel we're in that position, but it's certainly not contemplated currently in the guidance that we've provided for 2019.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, everyone, for all the questions. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates who listen in and how we all live our purpose every day, to our associates, thank you for your hard work. I am fortunate to meet so many of you across the Company and you are the incredible stories of what you do every day for each other in the communities. From our stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, you inspire me beyond my ability to express in words.

Please go ahead.","Kate Ward","Thanks, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, that Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.","Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions.","In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. At our investor conference in October, we discussed the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant. And Kroger is right in the middle of such a reinvention.","We are proactively addressing customer changes, and we've made strategic decisions to invest in a seamless digital experience, technology, associate wages and low prices. Combined, these efforts come together in Restock Kroger, our plan or create shareholder value by redefining how people eat. Our vision is to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.","Restock Kroger has four main drivers; redefine the grocery customer experience; expand partnerships to create customer value; develop talent; and live our purpose. Combined, these focus areas will create shareholder value. We announced Restock Kroger six months ago while also in the middle of one of the most complicated years in our history.","Throughout 2017, we continue to challenge our team to deliver our revised identical sales and earnings guidance from June. We are proud to share today that we delivered on those revised commitments for the year, finishing 2017 with strong sales and business momentum.","In 2017, we also grew digital sales by more than 90% and expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations. We gained market share for the 13th consecutive year, achieved $16.7 billion in annual natural and organic sales, including $2 billion in Simple Truth sales.","We launched Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, our commitment to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate waste across our business by 2025 and created 10,000 new American jobs in our supermarket locations across the country. All of this is encouraging as we start 2018.","Looking at 2018 and beyond, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a catalyst that will enable us to accelerate investments in Restock Kroger. And as we've shared a few times since the fall, we are taking a balanced approach to ensure tax reform benefits, our associates, customers and shareholders. Shareholders will benefit from approximately one-third of the tax savings flowing through the net earnings per diluted share.","For our customers, we'll make strategic investments to continue redefining the grocery customer experience through a combination of improved services, lower prices and added convenience. And for our associates, we are developing plans now to invest in long-term benefits, including education, wages and retirement.","We are looking ways to differentiate our associate experience with the underlying philosophy that we want to provide more than a onetime award. We want to make investments in our associates' future. As an example of this, we are doing a lot of work right now to develop an industry-leading education offering for associates.","Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and save for a career. We believe an enhanced commitment to employee education will drive the develop talent focus area of our plan. These investments underpin and accelerate Restock Kroger, which means we fully expect a strong return from each.","Sharing the benefits with our associates and customers will create a more sustainable and stronger business model to support Kroger's future. The investments are also aligned with our purpose, our promise and our values. We look forward to sharing more details on our plans with associates in the coming weeks.","We continue to create a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us, in-store and online. Whether through ClickList or home delivery, we continue to test, learn and scale what works using our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channels they choose when shopping with us.","In the fourth quarter, we introduced a seamless digital shopping experience that fully integrates our ClickList experiences with our other digital services, coupons, recipes, rewards and more. After just a couple of months, we already know our customers love it. Customers are making purchases on the site at a higher frequency than before and spending more per online order.","Households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores spend more per week than households that do not. And households that transact with us online spend even more. These results further validate our hypothesis, which has always been that customers want to have options for how they shop with us, and that hypothesis continues to shape our strategy to further accelerate our digital and e-commerce efforts.","When you look at our customer coverage areas for seamless shopping, more than two-thirds of our customers, more than 40 million shoppers have picked up and\/or delivery available from Kroger. Our goal is for every customer to have access to our convenient services.","In 2018, we will expand our digital coverage area and enhance our digital shopping experience to provide customers with relevant products, recipes, digital coupons, weekly ads, smart shopping lists and much more. To support this growth, we offer customers 1,091 pickup locations and more than 872 delivery locations across the country, and it continues to grow.","Next, I'd like to discuss how we're winning with Our Brands, and this helps Kroger redefine the customer experience. Our Brands performance this past year was extraordinary, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. In 2017, Our Brands achieved its highest ever unit share.","We reached $20.9 billion in total sales and reached $2 billion in annual Simple Truth sales, which to me is even all the more remarkable when you consider that the brand is only five years old. We also announced a partnership with Fair Trade USA. Simple Truth now offers more Fair Trade Certified products than any other private-label brand in the country.","For the fourth quarter, Our Brands made up 29.5% of unit sales and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. I think it's incredibly easy to take this success for granted, but I've seen the energy our teams have put into creating the right items, and it's really a big deal that an independent third-party research has validated the progress that we've made.","When you look at the results, they are extraordinary, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. The data is clear. Customers love Our Brands better than the national brands and better than other private-label offerings. Our Brands outperformed even the private-label brands you immediately think of as best-in-class.","And we're going to shout about it to our customers who have yet to experience it, Our Brands, no longer will miss out. We will be particularly focused on our top brands, Kroger private selection and Simple Truth. Our customers will be treated to an amazing array of enticing our new brand product introductions throughout the year, an assortment that will add excitement and simplify \u2013 simplicity to their lives, all at amazing prices.","And Our Brands are only available at Kroger. This is why Our Brands play such a pivotal role in Restock Kroger. Restock Kroger is off to a great start. Our leadership team and associates are aligned behind that effort, which is further reinforced by our annual incentive plan. Customers are letting us know that they see, feel and appreciate our efforts to redefine the customer experience. And they continue to reward us with growing loyalty. This is the cycle that creates value for shareholders.","We are confident that we will grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018, and we will create shareholder value by generating incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow over the next three years.","Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results and discuss our 2018 guidance. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Over the next three years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business.","We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next three years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan. If you recall at the conference, we talked about $4 billion after dividends. This is reconverted to a more conventional free dividend free cash flow calculation. So, we're trying to be a little more conventional in the number we talk about.","As you know, we've already reprioritized the way we invest capital over the next three years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales driving and cost-savings opportunities across brick-and-mortar and digital platforms.","Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.","We're aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost-of-goods sold. A big focus will be on store productivity and waste. Both of these will benefit from the $9 billion in capital investment over the next three years.","For example, store productivity will improve with the scheduled launch of Scan, Bag, Go in 400 new locations this year, and we are also pleased that strength continued its steady improvement throughout the year with good results in the fourth quarter.","We plan to generate $400 million of incremental operating margin from 2018 to 2020. We are taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward to 2018, so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated.","Turning to our results for the year. As you know, we revised our outlook in June to address the environment we're operating in. We've provided a narrow net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per diluted share, and we are pleased to have been near the top end of that range for the year. s you can imagine in a company our size, there are many moving parts in our operations.","Our goal is to manage the business on at least an annual cycle period. This can lead to quarterly fluctuations, but we always have our eye firmly on annual results and the long-term strength of the company.","We saw an opportunity at the beginning of the quarter to invest in the shopping experience and price while still delivering on our annual commitment. This is why our results reflected a gross profit rate decline of 31 basis points in the fourth quarter, but only 19 basis points for the year.","As a result of these investments, we saw growth in both households and total business, unit growth and market share growth. Since 2000, we've invested -- we've reduced prices for our customers by $4.1 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit in ID sales growth while delivering on the bottom line for shareholders.","This is the strategy we've been following for years, and it has served us well over time. It's a cornerstone of our Restock Kroger plan to invest more in redefining the shopping experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent that will be paid for by costs of good savings, strong IDs and productivity gains. This is where the incremental operating profit margin will come from over the next three years.","We continue to make investments at our associates through both higher wages and additional hours for ClickList and other services. In fact, there's two categories accounted for about half of the increase in OG&A in the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing from those investments.","Despite higher inflation during the fourth quarter, LIFO turned out to be a tailwind through the lower inventory in the levels and departments most affected by higher inflation, primarily pharmacy. Speaking specifically about ID sales, we are very pleased with the result of the 1.5% growth in the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed the company in the fourth quarter, including produce, deli fresh prepared, meat and seafood.","Our Natural Foods Department continue to generate strong double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and full year. 18 of our 22 supermarket operating divisions had positive IDs for the year as well, demonstrating the consistency of our results across the enterprise.","Kroger's market share grew for the 13th year in a row in 2017. Our consistent market share gains drove both top and bottom line growth to generate lasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it that way customers would look at it, where do they spend their money? We use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It's also worth noting that market share is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales.","According to IRI point-of-sale data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 21 basis points in 2017, a slight acceleration over last year's growth of 16 basis points based on IRI's calculations. Both our fourth quarter and full year results included several adjustment items described in table six from this morning's press release.","I want to spend a couple of minutes walking you through that table. These items are not included in our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share result of $0.63, and they are not included in our 2017 adjusted net earnings results of $2.04. So, none of these items were included in our $0.63, I think there's a little confusion about that from some folks that some of these numbers might have been in there.","As a result of the Tax Act, we recognize the tax benefit of $922 million in the fourth quarter. This was due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the reduction of our statutory income tax rate for the last few weeks of the fiscal year.","As part of the company's annual review of goodwill balances in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $110 million related to our Kroger specialty pharmacy business. This is primarily due to lower rebates and gross margins that we built into our future expectations. Kroger specialty pharmacy continues to perform well.","In the third quarter of 2017, certain assets and liabilities, primarily those related to our Convenience Store business, were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. Through these assets being classified as held for sale, these are no longer being depreciated. We benefited from this classification in both the fourth quarter of 2017 and fiscal 2017 by not having to record the $19 million of depreciation associated with those assets.","Our results were also affected by the previously announced settlement of obligations under the company-sponsored pension plan. We also made significant headway throughout the year in fourth quarter in particular on our long-term effort to address exposure in our pension plans while, at the same time, working with unions to provide Kroger associates with a more secure pensions.","During 2017, we proactively managed future risk in several ways. Most recently in December, Kroger and the International Brotherhood Teamsters announced the ratification of the new labor agreement that provided for Kroger's withdrawal from the Central States pension plan. We recognized a $351 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with this withdrawal and subsequently, we've negotiated a lump sum settlement for that, that I'll touch on in a moment.","This was in addition to the $292 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 through the obligation associated with the planned withdrawal of Roundy's Associates from the same fund and a $7 million charge for a separate multi-employer pension fund. As I said a minute ago, we made a lump sum payment to Central States in the fourth quarter. This totaled $467 million pre-tax. This replaces what would have been an approximately $3 million per month pre-tax withdrawal obligation payment over the next 20 years.","In the third quarter, we announced the $1 billion contribution to our company-sponsored pension plan. This funded a $502 million settlement charge accounted for in the fourth quarter through the termination of the cash balance company-sponsored pension plan that we've previously announced. So, we funded it in the third quarter, terminated it in the fourth quarter, which is why the charge occurred in the fourth quarter.","Fuel performance was very good in the fourth quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.172 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.18 in the same quarter last year. For 2017, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.206 compared to $0.171 the year before. And average retail price of fuel for all of 2017 was $2.36 versus $2.10 in 2016.","In February, we announced the definitive agreement for the sale of our convenience store business to EG Group for $2.15 billion. Our convenience store business has been part of the company for many years, and I can't stress enough how important they have been to processes, both with management and the associates at the store level and in the office.","We have been impressed with EG Group's professionalism, commitment to people and understanding of the U.S. convenience, retail market. We're very pleased EG Group plans to establish their North American headquarters in Cincinnati. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and we look forward to working with them closely to ensure a smooth transition for associates.","As we've previously announced, we plan to use the proceeds of the sale to repurchase shares and lower our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We can generally balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.","In 2017, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pre-tax to company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pre-tax to satisfy the withdrawal obligations for the Central States' pension fund. We also repurchased 61 million common shares for $1.6 billion. We paid $444 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital.","At the end of the fourth quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $270 million remaining, and our return on invested capital for 2017 on a 52-week basis was 12.03%.","We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we're bringing an off-balance sheet item on to our balance sheet, we\u2019re funding obligation already on our balance sheet like we did with the company plan.","As a result, in the third quarter, we updated our target range for this ratio to 2.2 to 2.4 times. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile has been reviewed but since they weren't funded, they previously did not get picked up in the net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio.","The lump sum settlement negotiated with the Central States Pension Fund in the fourth quarter is the most recent example of the company taking advantage of low interest rates and more favorable tax rates to secure the benefits \u2013 the retirement benefits we promised to our associates.","Because negotiating the settlement and bringing the obligation on our balance sheet was not contemplated when we updated our target last quarter, we're again updating our target range for this ratio to 2.3 to 2.5 times. Just as in the past, this obligation was always been part of our credit profile. The funding in the fourth quarter now picks up this obligation in our net total debt amounts.","Our current result of 2.6 times on a 52-week basis is above this range due primarily to the funding of the above-mentioned pension obligations. We expect to use free cash flow and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in this range. And as I said, this includes the sale of our convenience store business.","Protecting associate and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. As we noted in this morning's press release, Kroger created 10,000 supermarket jobs in 2017. To Restock Kroger, we are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next three years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.","Our store associates in our Cincinnati, Dayton division are currently voting on a tentative agreement between Kroger and the UFCW. This will be our first contract under Restock Kroger, and it includes an added investment in wages, raising the starting pay to at least $10 an hour and accelerating rate progression to $11 per hour after one year of service. These are the kinds of things we contemplated when we allocated $500 million to the talent portion of our Restock Kroger plan.","Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and the compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.","Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension costs which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help create more jobs and create opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to our guidance for 2018. We expect 2019 -- 2018 identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 1.5% to 2%. We expect net earnings to range from $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion, and we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.","And now I'll turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. We're proud of how our teams finished 2017, ending the year with positive momentum in sales in the overall business. We delivered the revised sales and earnings guidance we promised, gain market share for the 13th row -- year in a row, continued to grow our natural and organic food sales, grew digital sales by more than 90% and now offer a seamless digital experienced to more than 40 million customers in America. And of course, we relaunched Restock Kroger.","As we embark on our first full year of implementing Restock Kroger, we are committed to continuing this great momentum. And we will only accelerate our efforts to redefine the grocery customer experience through investments in digital, technology, pricing and convenience; to expand partnerships to create customer value by forming meaningful alliances with partners who share our commitment to putting the customer first; to develop talent by investing in our associate wages and education; and to live our purpose through our purpose and promise and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment.","We are focused on these key drivers of Restock Kroger because we know when we execute them well, we will create shareholder value. We are encouraged at the start of 2018 and confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve Americas through food inspiration and uplift.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Edward Kelly","Hi guys, good morning. So, Rodney and Mike, I guess, the first thing I want to start with is on the gross margin because obviously that's the point. I think that investors are -- were probably most disappointed with this quarter. Can you just provide more color on what happen here?","I mean, theoretically, you would have gotten on a full quarter of vendor initiative in Q4. Comparisons seemed a bit easier. It does seem like pockets of the country you're sort of hearing about things being at a minimum, not getting more promotional, but probably getting a little bit better. ","Was the ramp in the price investment as aggressive as it looks? What's the thought process behind it? And then how do we think about all this for next year? Should we be extrapolating this gross margin down sort of like the way we saw in Q4?","Mike Schlotman","Well, relative to the last portion of your question, I think I would answer that the same way we answered the increase in the gross margin in the third quarter that you should never really take any particular quarter and extrapolate it over any period of time other than that particular quarter.","As I said in the prepared comments, yes, we were down 30-something basis points in the quarter, but only 19 basis points in the year, which is a fairly normal kind of a reduction in investment in gross margins for us. I think that's more normal. We've been very open since October with Restock Kroger. ","When you look at the recent fine customer shopping experience that the investment in that is going to be more than the dollars we generate from that, and that's going to be funded by other parts of it. There's a chart back in October that delineated how we expect to invest in the business and how we expect to generate revenue or EBITDA from those investments and leading to the $400 million increase in operating profit margin.","Just giving you a little more background than you may be wanted of the journey we've been on since October. The short answer is you should expect gross margin to decline somewhat in 2018.","We aren't giving guidance on the individual amounts. We've talked about the fact that one-third of the tax savings will be invested in the business, one-third will be invested in our associates and one-third will go to our bottom line. Obviously, those are below gross margin or operating. But that benefit to EPS is below the line, if you will. But again, we always try to balance our annual expectations.","Rodney McMullen","And one other couple of things I would add to Mike. Mike mentioned it, but we really focus on the gross margin overall for the year. When you look at the year and the work that we've done on Restock Kroger, we worked \u2013 we are consistent with what we thought we would do with Restock Kroger.","As I've said before, we're not going to lose on price, but we're not out there trying to lead the market down. And as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we committed to improving operating margin dollars by 400 million over the next three years.","And we remain, as Mike said, to that expectation of ourselves, and we would continue to expect to grow going forward. The way we will finance that is continuing to take costs out of the business through cost of goods, through process changes. Mike mentioned the improvement that we had on shrink, for example, as well.","Edward Kelly","Okay. And just a follow-up as it pertains to reinvestment in taxes on that topic. Ever since I can remember from following you guys, the narrative has always been that your cost structures uncompetitive because of your unionization. Now it appears that the nonunionized players have to catch up.","The thought process is maybe you should be spending a little bit less than what they are. But this actually doesn't seem to be the case. So, could you just help us understand why your investment around the labor side actually kind of seems to be at a similar magnitude of what we're hearing around the rest of retail?","Rodney McMullen"," If you look at by far, and Mike mentioned it, the majority of our investment in labor has been in starting wages. And in the past, we've always had people very easily would come for a job and make it a career understand over time, there is wage progression.","Over time, as jobs became very plentiful, that starting wage became more important. So, we've meaningfully increased starting wages across the company, and a big chunk of the increase is there and the other huge chunk in the investment in labor that we're making on ClickList and the aggressive expansion and rollout of ClickList.","Mike, anything you want to add to?","Mike Schlotman","Yes. And those two combined to be about half of the increase in OG&A in the quarter.","Edward Kelly","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to clarify, first of all, did you give a tax dollar benefit amount before I ask my question? Because you did give one -- you didn't refute one on CNBC this morning, and it was $200 million, and I thought the dollars you were going to get was higher than that?","Mike Schlotman","Well, I will say that on CNBC this morning, that was a little bit all over the board very much in the quarter. I actually didn't have a chance to respond to their number of $200 million because it is higher than that. As we said in the prepared comments, we expect to invest one-third in the business, one-third for our associates and one-third in the bottom line.","Karen Short","Okay.","Mike Schlotman","So, in total, Karen, it's about $0.36, $0.37, somewhere in that range. So, it's -- their tax rate, it takes about $11 million to pretax to have $0.01 a share. So, it's somewhere around $400 million of benefit, and we're investing at one-third, one-third, one-third.","Rodney McMullen","And the investments we're making we've talked about in the call, we truly expect to return and what it does -- what we did was accelerate some of the key parts of Restock Kroger.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. We're moving some of them up so we can get the benefit sooner and then the latter years won't be burdened by these investments because we've already taken care of them.","Karen Short","Okay. So, I guess, that matters as it relates to your EPS. So, when you look at your EPS guidance and you back into EBIT, I guess, the numbers I get for EBIT for fiscal 2018 or calendar 2018 could be any -- down anywhere from 22 -- well, 15% to 22%. So, I guess, the first question I had on EBIT is it fair to say that you'll be much more kind of at that low-end in the first half given the accelerated D&A?","And then I guess the second half hopefully a little bit better? And then, I guess, what matters is what the core is doing because we can all take this $400 million and take two-thirds of it, right? So, two-thirds of that is part of the EBIT decline as opposed to the core decline, if that question makes sense. Is that the way you think about that?","Mike Schlotman","I'm not going to get into giving guidance on what our EBIT's going to be. If you notice in our 8-K, we didn't give guidance on our operating profit margin primarily because of the conversation you're having, Karen, trying to predict exactly where it's going to be when that's up above and I'm paying for some of my investments with tax savings dollars down below.","We are balanced to try to make the numbers we talked about at our incentive plan will only kick in a big way if we make the numbers we talked about relative to our earnings per share guidance.","We've been talking since way back in September. We said it again in November and -- in December, and I've said it multiple times when webcast since that we didn't see anything for this year that would cause us to be below $1.80 and we were striving to be equal or slightly above an adjusted 52-week year. Well, a 52-week year is the $1.95 and then above that plus the $0.12, so we did the $1.95 as the anchor rather than the $1.80.","And then the $0.10 to $0.12 from the tax savings plus being slightly above it is how we got to the $2.15. Estimates out there, it's probably the widest range I can ever remember this morning when I looked, the range of estimates for next year were from $1.84 to $2.40. So, there's clearly a confusion about exactly what that number was going to be and how the tax savings dollars were going to fall.","Karen Short","Okay. But is it fair to say though, the first half, you have much higher D&A, right? So, the decline will be greater in the first half all else equal, then it will be in the second half? And I guess, the other question is on the investments in price or wages, is any of that front-end loaded? Or is it pretty evenly distributed?","Rodney McMullen","The depreciation for book won't be affected by the immediate deduction available under the Tax Act. That would add -- we'll deduct if I -- if I buy a seven-year piece of equipment for book, I'll depreciate it over seven years. For tax, I get it immediately, so that won't grow my deferred tax liability balance back up after I reduced it. So, the D&A immediate expense unit of D&A is only for tax, not for book.","Karen Short","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","All right. Thank you. Question on what you talked about in terms of tax-free investment. I think you mentioned that some of it will go to educating employees. And if I'm hearing you right, it sounds like the implication is that maybe you have a pool of money going toward your associates, some of it toward cash bonuses and some of it toward this education. ","And I get that from a long-term perspective, right? I'm just curious in a tight labor market, do you have data that really shows the right move to sort of not spend all of that on bonuses or on wages? I'm just curious you talked about some markets being $10 or $11 per hour.","I think cost of goods so the average wages in their employees is over $22. So just thinking about that balance and any data you have that can help us understand that would be helpful?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. In terms of our average wage, it's significantly higher than any of the numbers that we've talked about. And the other thing, I think always to remember is that in addition to our average wage, we also provide health care and pension benefits to associates after they \u2013 as a general rule full time or when they haven't been after they've been here for a little while. ","We were very focused on not having something that was a one-time bonus. But what were the things that our associates told us that's important to them and one of the reasons that they come to work for us and that when you look at people earlier in their career, the ability to have flexible hours and the ability to continue with an education was something that they give us feedback that was very important to them.","So, we really view that, that is an important part of investing in our associates, and it's something that we believe is our associates gain skill, they will be more productive in terms of their day-to-day influence on Kroger, and also, I help them move from a job to a career with us.","So, for us, it was really important for not just to be a one-time headline number, but what is something that are associates view as incredible valuable and helpful over time, and that was an area where associates told us they were important. As you all of us know, people are increasingly worrying about college debt and the debt they take on and a small way will be helpful for associates as well.","Mike Schlotman","So, Ken, to be clear, none of our differed of the tax-saving investment in our associates will be in the form of a bonus. We just don't think that's long lasting and drives retention or drives employee morale over the long term. We think that's temporary, it gets a big headline and is somewhat fleeting, and we're trying to make our investment in things that will drive retention and morale over the longer term.","Ken Goldman","That's very helpful. Can I just ask a quick follow-up? Mike, I appreciate you're not wanting to give some of the guidance items that you typically in the past would have given. But there are certain items that maybe are unaffected by tax, fuel, gross profit per gallon assumption, LIFO assumption, maybe some color on the current quarter. Any help you could give with that would be appreciated.","Mike Schlotman","Yeah. I don't think we've typically given -- I guess, we've given a range of margin per gallon. It's one of those things, Ken, we did make a conscious decision to skinny down the individual items we give guidance on.","Because every time the results a little different than what you expect, that becomes the only talking point versus our promise is to deliver on Restock Kroger over the three years, to deliver the $6.5 billion of free cash flow, to deliver the $400 million in operating profit growth over the next three years and as it relates to 2018 specifically, to have ID sales between 1.5% and 2% and earnings per share from $1.95 to $2.15. and it\u2019s \u2013 every time we have to change in those numbers 8-K, it becomes the talking point and sometimes the forest gets lost for the trees.","Ken Goldman","I understand. And thanks, Mike.","Mike Schlotman","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stevens Incorporated. Please go ahead.","Ben Bienvenu","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning, Ben.","Ben Bienvenu","Mike, I want to follow up on some comments or could have been Rodney some comments you made on the pull-forward of investments as it relates to Restock Kroger. My inference from the comment is that there is not also an associated pull-forward of the operating margin growth benefits that you would see as a result of those investments.","So, is it correct interpretation of what you said to think that those benefits would accrue in years two and three of the plan versus concurrent with the pull-forward of investments in 2018? And to what extent that's still reflected in your guidance?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. If you look at they way we even started talking about Restock Kroger back in October, it was always designed when you start looking at the numbers that, and we have been given guidance that our 2018 way back in September when we talked about not less than $1.80.","And hopefully, we would stride to be flat to slightly above this year, the report of 2017 numbers, it's pretty easy to assume that we weren't expecting operating margin dollar expansion with an earnings per share range like that. We've obviously updated it with the final results for this year, the final business plan for 2018 now completed as well as really good clarity on exactly how we're going to invest the tax savings dollars.","The short answer is, yes, operating profit margin dollars will likely be down in 2018, and we're going to pull dollars forward out of 2019 and 2020 where the margin dollars should be higher. And we will pay for that for known, the known been the tax savings that are real dollars.","And we are working diligently to deliver the savings dollars. We're pulling these dollars forward with real savings dollars that we effectively already have in the bank because of the lower tax dollars we're going to have to spend. This isn't designing the plan that's going to reduce shrink by 10 basis points in 2018 and hope that.","I hate use the word hope. I always quickly trying to find different one, but believing that we're going to be able to do that 10 basis point reduction and that was going to pay for our investments.","From a cash flow standpoint, from after-tax cash flow standpoint, we were absolutely neutral doing it this way, and it's going to benefit 2019 and 2020 when we make some of those investments this year can still deliver the earnings per share growth and after-tax cash flow that we think we can deliver out of the plan.","Mike Schlotman","Ben, I don't know if this helps you but from one of the numbers Mike outlined in October was we expect cost reductions and savings of $4.450 billion over the next three years. That savings is what we would still expect. We have not included tax savings in that $4.450 billion.","And then if you look at what we plan to invest, the $4.050 billion that Mike talked about in October, our investment plan would still be the $4.050 billion. We\u2019ve just accelerated some of that into \u2013 or 2008 where before, it was 2009 or 2010. ","Rodney McMullen","2018 and 2019. Move forward to 2018 instead of 2019 and 2020. And still \u2013 we're still targeting the same numbers. We're still targeting the same operating profit margin growth at the end of three years, and we're still expecting the same free cash flow.","And if you remember, on free cash flow, in fact, I talked about $6.5 billion. If you take what I talked about in October was $4.5 billion, but that was reduced for $1.5 billion of dividends over the three years, so we\u2019ve increase that by $500 million for some of the tax savings falling into free cash flow. ","Ben Bienvenu","Okay. So just to summarize that, there's a pull-forward of the operating margin investments into this year versus what had been over \u2013 more steadily over three years, there's not a pull-forward of the operating growth, but it will be heavier in years two and three and paired with less operating margin investment in years two and three? Is that the right way to think about it?","Mike Schlotman","Correct. And from an earnings per share standpoint, we're paying for that with a known increase in earnings per share from a lower tax rate.","Ben Bienvenu","Got it.","Rodney McMullen","So, you have to go out and figure out a way to say, we know we're going to be able to pay for that from an earnings per share standpoint and a cash flow standpoint, because these are real cash dollars with a lower tax payment.","Ben Bienvenu","Awesome. Thank you so much for that. And then a quick follow-up on freight, I didn't hear it mentioned in your comments. It's been a thematic touch point across the retail landscape over the last reporting period. To what extent is that impacting your gross margins? And how do you think about that cost pressure going forward? Thank you so much.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. We're pretty well protected on freight. Obviously, we have our own captive fleet that delivers products from our warehouses to our stores. We have a little bit of third-party there, but they're under contracts. A lot of our inbound freight is under contracts that are being honored, and those folks typically have a good supply of drivers.","There is a little bit we do in the spot market and we're subject to some of the disruptions in a somewhat minor way on that. Relative to third party, the CPG companies, there are a few of them that are having disruptions in some of their freight.","We've been pretty firm and pretty much still invest. It's their issue, not our issue, because we agreed to pay a certain price for the product and their obligation is to get it to us for that price, and we'll see how that evolves over the rest of this year.","Ben Bienvenu","Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen"," Thanks, Ben.","Operator","The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","John Heinbockel","So, Rodney, question. Tactically, the third that you're going to invest in people, how do you do that in the context of the unionized business and contracts, right? So, contracts that might be up next year, the year after, are \u2013 is most of the investment in contracts coming up this year? How do you deal with the contracts that are yet to expire in terms of wages or benefits?","Rodney McMullen","In some cases, you may end up doing a contract early. But as Mike mentioned like in the Cincinnati contract, that was part of what was negotiated was to increase starting wages and increase the progression during the first year. And we've been doing that as contracts have been coming up during 2017.","But it's a -- your question is a great one, and it's one of those where you actually sit down with each local and have that conversation. And you target those conversations with places where your starting wage needs to be adjusted. We don't have starting wage needs to be adjusted across every part of the country, just parts of the country.","John Heinbockel","And the one-third that you would invest in the business, how much of that is price or promotion? And when you think about the draw forward of right of some of these investments, is the comp outlook -- I mean in your mind, is the comp outlook better in '19 and '20 versus what it would have been if you hadn't done this? And you probably want to quantify that, but how much better?","Rodney McMullen","If you look -- I'm going to broaden my answer a little broader than just your question. Certainly, as we look out to 2019 and 2020, we increasingly see opportunities for the business to grow in a reasonable way.","And if you think about our investments that we've been making in our digital and seamless experiences on a year-on-year basis that continues to be a headwind at some point, late next year or early 2020, that will end up becoming something that's a tailwind because of process changes that we've made on reducing the costs of doing stuff and the growth in the customer in terms of what they spend with us.","So, when you look at all the pieces that we have together, we really see that we're positioning the company to start growing again as you start looking out to '19 and '20 and starting it out proactively doing it in a position of strength as well.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks John.","Operator","The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey great, good morning guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Wanted to ask in just in terms of margins for 2018, just to be sure, in terms of freight, what level? Or do you have some cushion baked in for I know you said you're relatively protected with what you own and a lot contract it's not so much on the spot market. But do you have some level of an increase in freight costs baked in there?","And then also just on the vendor negotiations, which was obviously more of a topic last quarter, should we look at that as a potential for ongoing opportunities? Or was it just because maybe more it kind of came to it once last quarter and over time, you really haven't seen any notable changes there?","Mike Schlotman","Yes. I would say the performance -- the on-time performance hasn't moved dramatically. The fine amount was about the same in the fourth quarter as the third quarter. Relative to -- I won't get specific on transportation as a subset of my margin number. But as you can imagine and accompany our side, pretty much everything we do is talked about in ranges. ","And then when we go to do our internal business plan, we pick a point estimates somewhere within that range. So pretty much everything has a range around it just like transportation would be and then you make a point estimate and put that into the model. ","You build everything else around it and you move and tweak things to get to what we think is the right answer to strive for as a point estimate for the year. It's the reason we do earnings per share in a range. All of those kinds of things would result in the kind of range you see.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. In terms of our team and the way we're partnering with our CPG partners on the vendor negotiation, there wouldn't have been any change in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.","And from a talent standpoint and the way we've \u2013 what we're negotiating, we've supplemented our team by some talent that we recruited from outside of the company. So, feel really good about where we are.","We really do continue to view our CPG relationships as partnerships, but we will use our data to make sure that we understand the strength of each brand and each brand within a category and as we\u2019re renegotiating, use that part of the negotiation. And all the backdrop is our own brands, the strength of them continued \u2013 continues to improve, and we have very high ratings on that promotability in tax line as well.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up if I can. For the C-store sale, I'm guessing at this point, there's nothing's really kind of specifically incorporated into your 2018 outlook.","But, of course, we do know as you said kind of repurchases and debt pay-down are the main priorities with sort of the proceeds. Should we think of it as more of kind of all right both kind of begin in 2Q and kind of incrementally are spread, let's say, evenly across the future quarters, or should we expect kind of more early on? Just any comments on that would be helpful.","Rodney McMullen","I know it would be helpful, but I won't to explain exactly what our strategy is for repurchasing shares. I did have the opportunity to read a couple of the quick analyst reports that came out as the release crossed the wire.","And one thing I want to clear up is our guidance range that's out there, the $1.95 to 2.15, is with or without the C-Store sale. We will use the proceeds to reduce shares, to replace the EBITDA that goes away without transaction. I'm not going to talk about EBITDA level right now, and we will use a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt to balance our net total debt EBITDA ratio out.","So, we built the plan, so that whether we kept the C-Store's or sell the C-Store's, we will offset the lost EBITDA from the year by buying in shares, and then we'll use the rest and other free cash flow to reduce debt to get our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio in balance.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay, all right. That\u2019s helpful. We will now stay tune. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Kate Ward","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And that question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question, fitting me in. May be first on the guidance, I'm guessing you probably won't answer, but we're getting a lot of questions in terms of how to think about the seasonality of EPS growth this year. So, anything you could qualitatively give us color in terms of how you think first half or second half EPS growth.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, it's \u2013 I would go back to the earlier question on margin per gallon of fuel on where we think that might be and things like that. We really do run our business over the course of a year.","And frankly, we try to run it a little bit \u2013 over a little bit longer time frame than a year. But we do try to make sure that we have guidance out there that's relevant and meaningful to investors. My long-winded answer is I'm not going to give you quarterly cadence. We are in this for the long haul. A quarter is 12 weeks long most times. The first quarter, 16 weeks long.","And trying to say every quarter is going to exactly X or exactly Y. I can tell you they're rarely wind up exactly at X, exactly Y and that's why we make modifications throughout the year. We sometimes we meet a little more sometimes, we have a little extra, and do we take some of the bottom line?","Do we invest more? And we're constantly balancing that throughout the year and really try to do that on a rolling year basis, not just when I get midway through the year. I'm only worried about the second half, we're already thinking about the first half and next year.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. Then I guess, my real question for the call. So, as you look out home delivery I know you guys recently expanded a partnership with Instacart. So, I was curious how that was going.","And just given some of their competitive developments out there, do you feel as you look at where you guys are currently doing home delivery that you need to accelerate your investment in this area going forward?","Rodney McMullen","Well, as you know, if you go back a little over a year ago, we did home delivery almost to no stores and now we're up to almost 900 stores. We would continue to look at home delivery as part of our offering.","What we find is some customers like delivery. Some customers like pickup, and some customers like to go in-store. And probably the most common thing is we find customers actually do all three.","And it just depends on what's going on in their life and whether they have a soccer practice to get to or from or whatever. So, for us, you should expect to see us continually expanding the way customers can engage with us and do that digitally and with the mobile app. And we'll continue to make investments in those areas.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Rupesh.","Rodney McMullen","Hopefully, from Mike's and my comments and stuff, you could tell that we're incredibly excited about the future of Kroger. And when you look at Restock Kroger, the pieces of Restock Kroger are coming together exactly the way we would have hoped and get excited about.","Our customers continue to tell us we're doing a better job and our associates tell us that they are having more fun serving our customers. So, all those pieces are coming together, and we continue to invest for the future in terms of the way we think customers will want to engage in a retailer five years from now, not just today. So hopefully, you could feel that excitement from our comments.","The other thing I'd like to do is just share a few additional comments with our associates listening in. Today, it's very fitting that its International Women's Day. Kroger is proud to join organizations across the world to support and celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. This day is a great opportunity to live our purpose and demonstrate our values and diversity and inclusion by uplifting the women in our workplace.","At our headquarters building in Cincinnati, we're joining with several other downtown companies in lighting up our building with a female symbol to celebrate women in business. And last night, we had it lit up and it looked fabulous.","I'd also want to encourage you to check out a video that we're sharing online both internally and externally that highlights several of our women executives. We are proud to be a workplace that works for women and to support their career aspirations and goals. ","This is what it really means to live our purpose; to Feed the Human Spirit. With St. Patrick's Day and a pretty big basketball tournament right around the corner, March is always fun and a fabulous celebration time of the year.","I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities we have to uplift our customers and each other every day and to help our customers have great celebrations, great parties and a great experience in our stores and through our digitally experiences.","Thank you for what you do each and every day. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12982":["Kroger Co.

We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.

Please save the date for our 2016 Investor Conference, which will be held in Cincinnati on November one and 2. Details will be coming soon, and we hope that you can join us.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a three to five year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.","By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected. The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before. In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.","While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a three to five-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves. While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.","To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term. This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity. We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.","Our team at 84.51\u00b0 helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one. A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were three months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next three months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer. Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.","We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger. We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm. Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.","One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family. A second example of a long - of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible, thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices.","Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders. I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term. We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.","Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.","There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy. Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.","As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all three of these things during the second quarter. That. Our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way. As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time.","Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.","Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling four quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling four-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year. A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by our lower-than-expected effective income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard.","Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share. Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have two dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.","During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories. Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.","Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second - the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.","Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of two troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last four years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.","In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate four multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits - that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates. In 2014, we announced similar agreements with two additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value. Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share - per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations.","Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.","Now I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike. We are in this for the long term whether it is our sustainability initiatives, job creation or return to shareholders. None of these are short-term ventures or quick fixes. We've been through business cycles like this before, and we know the best and right thing to do is to deliver on our promise today while investing for the future. We are as committed as ever to our Customer 1st Strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So maybe you can talk about how you guys - and obviously you've got a lot of data, how you think about the analytics around price elasticity in a deflationary environment versus inflationary, right, in trying to get a decent, at least short-term ROIC. And then - and contrast that with maybe what you're seeing in the marketplace competitively. Because it always struck me that, right, when you have a deflationary environment and your costs are going down, people can be a little more irrational and make poor decisions, right, because their COGS are going down. So curious how you look at that and what you're seeing from your competition.","Rodney McMullen","Well, the - thanks. The - it's a great question, and it's a little hard to answer because each category would be a little different. And if you look at some of the beef and pork categories, people are moving back into those categories in a very, very strong way, and we have incredible tonnage growth in those areas. So the elasticity, you have tons. Other categories where people kind of buy what they need all the time anyway, you don't see as much. So if you think about eggs, for an example, people only eat a certain number of eggs. But some of the other categories would be a little different. The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out because - it's fascinating. In a research, most people are saying their basket of goods cost more money, but we, in fact, know that it isn't. So helping the customer see that is always a challenge for us and our competitors as well. Go ahead, John.","John Heinbockel","No, that's good.","Rodney McMullen","And when you look at the competition, it's kind of the same as what we've always had in each - one of the - what they say in each short statement in economics is wrong because if you look across the country, you have competitors doing all kinds of different things depending on what's going on in their business and what's going on in that part of the country. So there really isn't a consistency to it that I would say it's completely different today than before.","John Heinbockel","Yes. Well, [indiscernible] because you guys always talked about - you felt competition has not changed. It was rigorous but not irrational. I mean, it just looks like there are pockets of irrationality. And I wondered, is that true? And particularly in protein, is that made worse in the Memorial Day to Labor Day time period because that's kind of prime beef season? And then so post Labor Day, that should come down or no?","Rodney McMullen","The - I guess, I'm a little - I wouldn't be quite as aggressive on saying people are being irrational because I don't see anything that is different today than when you go back and look at it over the last year or three years or 5 years. And you always have certain pockets where people are doing something different than overall. I'm just trying to think from a Labor Day standpoint and some of the ads, I wouldn't say that there was something drastically different than what...","Mike Schlotman","Like the holiday ad.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. And you're going to put in the ad the things that the customers want for that period of time. And to your comment, certainly, people grow out a lot more on that weekend just because it's kind of the last major weekend of summer.","Operator","The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Edward Kelly","So Rodney, I just wanted to follow-up on John's question because there has been, I guess, a fair amount of talk now from, I guess, food retailing competitors about conventional grocery stores getting much more aggressive from a promotional standpoint. We - there's also been plenty of talk about Walmart being more aggressive within the marketplace as well. You're kind of suggesting that you don't see as much of that. So I'm just wondering where that disconnect maybe would come from. And then as part of all that, could you just talk about what you are seeing so far in your third quarter, both from the perspective of your ID growth and the general promotional cadence of your business?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at competitors, the thing that you really have to look at is you have to look at across the whole country. You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that. As you know, we have a basket of goods that we look at on almost a weekly basis in terms of how is our pricing relative to our strategy and relative to our competition. And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh - the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there.","And then really a critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to - when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's - as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy. If you look at what's within it though, it has changed over time as customers change. So if you look at natural and organics, when we started the journey, natural and organics really wasn't a critical part of the product strategy. Today, it's incredibly important. And I don't know, Mike, it's probably, what, 10% or a little over 10% of our business when you look at it in total.","Mike Schlotman","Yes, definitely over 10%.","Rodney McMullen","So those are - elements, I think, are equally important. When you look at where we are so far in the third quarter, obviously, we're early in the quarter. We would be at the low end of the range on identical sales growth, but we're still very early in the quarter.","Edward Kelly","I think it's - right, let me ask a question...","Mike Schlotman","And also keep in mind, the third quarter is a tough compare for us with the - in the face of deflationary pressures on the top line. It was a mid-5s quarter last year in the third quarter. So combination of a very strong ID sales quarter last year and deflation last year is certainly a factor on where we are and where we'll wind up.","Edward Kelly","Let me just ask the question maybe a different way. Like if we look back at the last period of meaningful deflation, it was obviously a tough period for the industry from a promotional standpoint. If I look at your guidance, it seems to imply there is probably not much deterioration in the gross margin baked in. We sort of look at your numbers historically over a long period of time. I don't think I've ever seen ID growth as low as it's now going to be in the back half of the year without seeing that. We're hearing sort of pockets of more aggressive promotions. I guess, what I'm really trying to understand, Rodney, is why this period is going to be different, why the movie that we saw in 2009 doesn't play out the same way. Because I think just from looking at your numbers and what I'm hearing from you, that's what you're anticipating..","Rodney McMullen","Yes. And when you look at from most of the elements we can see at this moment, we would expect it to look pretty similar to '09. If you look at back in '09, the identicals would be similar. I think we were at 1.3% and 1.8% or something like that. I don't remember for sure.","Mike Schlotman","1.3% and 1.2% in the third and fourth quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Yes. So both of those would be within the range where we've given for the balance of the year. We would certainly expect - typically, you do see a little bit more promotional activity early in inflation cycles just because the competitors think they're losing share versus the it's a fact that it's deflation. And we would certainly include some of those elements in terms of where we expected things to be for the balance of the year. But everything that we can see, '09 would be the most similar. And if you look at '09, there were three quarters of deflation. If you go back and actually look at 2002, there are four quarters of deflation. So those are kind of the points that we're using for references.","Operator","And the next question is from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank.","Shane Higgins","And actually, just following a little bit on Ed's question. The deflation that we're seeing today, do you think we're really in a similar situation as in 2009? I mean, at that time, I recall we were cycling some pretty high inflation in '08. That's not really the situation today. Just inflation wasn't very high last year. The economy today is expanding, albeit slowly. So this environment does feel a little bit different. I mean, do you think if we stay in a more sustained deflationary environment that the promotional environment could intensify from here? I don't know, any thoughts you guys have on that would be great.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. It\u2019s kind of fascinating, your question. I mean, if you look at over the last 8 or 9 years, if you look at inflation on a rolling 5-year basis, the range is 2% to 3% on a rolling 5 years. Now, if you look at it in terms of swings, we had deflation of basically 1% or so, and this includes pharmacy, I should add, up to inflation of 6%. And that the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation\/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. ","And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices, because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things where they don't make money. So historically, that's what\u2019s caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth in those elements and those are the things that we're looking at to see, do we think it's different this time.","Shane Higgins","All right. Thanks for that color. And just a quick follow-up, I mean, given that you guys have such a strong private-label portfolio, I believe, Rodney, you said it was 27% of units during the quarter. Does this give you guys some additional flexibility in periods of inflation and deflation in terms of maybe being able to pass along some of the lower costs more quickly? Any color that you guys could give there will be great. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit, Shane. For us, corporate brands is a huge, important critical part of our strategy and a very important competitive advantage. And it starts with what products are we offering and what's the quality of those products and the value for those products. We find it always an advantage from a competitive standpoint, because if national brands do something that's non-economic, our corporate brands pick up share. So we find them -- our customers love them and they vote by buying a lot of them. We also find that it's a way of keeping the market honest. We certainly would have an advantage in terms of understanding the true economic cost to produce something, and retail pricing would be based on that true economic cost.","Shane Higgins","And then actually just a -- I'd like to squeeze just one more in. Are you guys working pretty closely with your vendor partners in this period to try to, since you guys understand the costs so well, to try to get the best prices? And how are those conversations going?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, always. And then as you know, we always look at the CPG companies as partners. And I obviously go to a quite a few meetings where the CPG partners and Kroger meet. And a lot of times, it's hard to figure out who works for who, which I view as a positive. Both of us are trying to drive volume and trying to drive profitability, and most of the CPG teams have a responsibility for part of our profit as well. So I don't see those discussions changing. There are healthy respect, but there are also healthy negotiations that go on. And I don't sense a change in that basic approach. And the other thing that we always feel that we are able to provide the best insights for CPG companies on introducing new items, what's the success, what customers are buying, and we try to work with those partners to grow their business as well.","Shane Higgins","Great. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Shane.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go back to your comments, Rodney, on the U.S. consumer. It sounded more down deep to me versus prior quarters. Just want to get a sense, if you look at your business, are you actually seeing consumers pull back on discretionary spending? Or is that just based on the surveys that you believe the consumer is more cautious?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. If you look at the areas that we would consider discretionary like high-value wine, Boar's Head, Starbucks, Murray's Cheese, all of those areas, they continue to have nice growth. The comments I made are more based on the surveys that we -- where we survey customers almost every day and the changes in terms of what the customers tell us they anticipate will happen.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then switching topics to inflation and deflation. What are you building in for the balance of the year on the deflation front? And is it fair to say that at this point, you're assuming that deflation will continue through at least the early part of next year?","Mike Schlotman","Yeah. We did not provide a point estimate or a range in our 8-K that we filed this morning. We only talked about the fact that we expect to see product cost deflation for the balance of the year. And as Rodney said, it could extend into early next year as well in his prepared comments.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. I'm going to sneak in one last one. From a tonnage perspective, has your tonnage growth been consistent with prior quarters? Or has it -- or did you see any change this period?","Mike Schlotman","We continue to be very pleased with our tonnage growth. It's positive. There's a lot of things that go on inside tonnage growth. There's mixed pack changes. There are certain categories where we've gone to multipack units, bigger selling units of multiple items in the same package. We continue to be very, very bullish about our ability to grow tonnage. Rather, we try to avoid giving an exact measure because it's much as an art, as a science, but it's something we're fundamentally focused on. We had nice tonnage growth, and we continue to have market share growth in the quarter as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Thank you for all the color.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal","Thanks so much for taking the question. Good morning. Just a follow-up on that last question a little bit. So the data that we're looking at, I guess, would suggest that input cost deflation should be moderating a bit into the back half. Do you think that that's accurate at all? And how do you see the retail side of this playing out from here? Do you have any expectations for how long this typically -- this kind of thing typically would last?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at how long it lasts, the only insight that I could provide is the comment I made a little earlier. If you go back and look at 2009, it was three quarters. If you go back to 2002, it was four quarters. We've had inflation every quarter other than those since the first quarter of 2002 as how far back we went. On terms of moderating, as you get toward the latter part of the year and early next year, you're starting to cycle the deflation. ","So I would -- certainly, we would guess that it would start to moderate just because you're starting to cycle some of the deflation. And an awful lot of the deflation is driven because of commodity pricing. And that would be the reason why that we would believe that it would start moderating. And then when you start cycling, it would -- we don't expect it to be negative for a long period of time.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Now is that at all part of sort of the guide here? As you say, you're sort of tracking toward the lower end of the back half guide. Or do you -- would you say that that dynamic reflects your expectation of improvement in retail? Or would you say it's more about the compare? Or how would you describe that?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, why don't you say it --?","Mike Schlotman","There's a little distraction here in the room.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. Stephen, if you don't mind asking the question again because all of a sudden, we had extra voice in the room.","Stephen Tanal","Yes, of course. The guidance for IDs, being at the low end now versus obviously a bit of a higher range or a higher midpoint, is that more reflective of your expectation of improvement in retail prices or more about just the compares from a year ago?","Rodney McMullen","I would certainly say a big piece of that is the compare to last year. Last year, in the third quarter, we had 5.4% ID sales. So when you look at the deflation we've had since then compared to that compare, it's really a little bit of a compounding effect as we begin the third quarter here. Keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter was 3.7% IDs, so the compare starts to moderate a little bit as well. And that just -- it's the range we feel that, at this point, where we think we would wind up in.","Stephen Tanal","Great. And if I could just sneak one last one in. If you could comment on the health and wellness side. Obviously, with the Axium date, it seems like you do have some interest in the pharmacy business. Any thoughts on that business, building it out maybe longer term?","Rodney McMullen","Well, it's -- when you look at the total health and wellness strategy, we are very excited about the opportunities there. Obviously, all of us, baby boomers, keep getting older and the new generations as well, and it creates higher demand for pharmaceuticals and other things. So it's an area that we like. It's an area where we believe we have a unique competitive advantage just because we can start helping customers eat healthier as well, and that's something that's a positive in terms of the overall connection with the customer. ","And when you look at all the pieces together, we think it's a great opportunity to create sum of all parts where a customer can engage with us in a physical facility, online or through the specialty drug channel and then we can leverage across and then the Little Clinic helps as well. So we really get excited about the opportunities. And the other thing that we really like is that customer is very loyal as well.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Hi. A couple of quick clarification questions. The statement about quarter-to-date comps being near the lower end of the range, was that the annual range or the back half range?","Rodney McMullen","It's the back half range. And remember Mike's comment about as you go to this -- first of all, we're cycling incredibly strong identicals a year ago, and then as you get to the fourth quarter, you start cycling identicals that were lower than where they were in the third quarter. I don't know, Mike, anything you're going to add?","Mike Schlotman","I would agree with that.","Ken Goldman","Okay. My other clarification, there were a few deflation numbers that were mentioned this morning. I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page of it with those. I think what you said, and correct me if I'm wrong, total company deflation was minus 1%. Total deflation ex-pharma was minus about 1.25% and perishable deflation was minus 1.5%. Do I have those right?","Mike Schlotman","So yeah, a little less than 1%, including pharmacy; 1.25%, excluding pharmacy; and grocery was about 1.5% negative.","Rodney McMullen","And that's grocery only. And it\u2019s the way we define grocery.","Mike Schlotman","Which includes the dairy complex. Not everybody has the dairy complex in grocery, but we do.","Ken Goldman","Okay. I had heard that can be perishables. I guess it was grocery. Okay. Thank you. One quick one here. Sprouts said this week, and if you\u2019ve addressed this, forgive me, but most of the more extreme pricing actions they\u2019re seeing in the marketplace were promo driven, not really list price reductions. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that one of the reasons you have hope that maybe some of the irrationality you're seeing out there will be short lived?","Mike Schlotman","Well, we see a little bit of everything out there. And as Rodney said a few minutes ago, our -- over the breadth of the geographies we have, you see a variety of everything. You see people in certain -- even if they're a broad-based retailer, you see them doing things in one geography and not other geographies, and then you see regionals doing particular things in and out of different promotions and then other people continuing to make investments in price. And we did a little bit of all those as well. ","We put out a circular, sometimes weekly, sometimes for a couple of weeks, and we continue to invest in everyday price as well, so it's really no different. I think the thing to keep in mind is, we don't always necessarily just react to what particular competitors are doing with our relationship with 84.51\u00b0. We put significantly more science behind how and when we make price investments, whether it's promotional activity or a permanent price reduction.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And next, we have Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey, great. Good morning, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Just going back to the comments from the macro perspective, first, on the consumer with the surveys. Wondering if you're seeing anything different kind of sequentially in terms of snap that's being used in the stores or in terms of the items in the basket. ","And then secondly, just on the competitive commentary that you gave, I understand that varies by geography. But just wondering just kind of if overall, are you seeing some of the heavier pockets of competition coming from particular segments of the market, whether that be more of the larger conventionals, the big boxes or some of the smaller regionals discount, that type of thing?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah. When you look at the surveys overall, first of all, snap continues to decline and it has for the last, I'm going off of memory, and then Mike, if you remember the exact number, but I want to say like a year-and-a-half or so that it's been declining.","Mike Schlotman","That's about right.","Rodney McMullen","Some of the decline is driven because of changes in terms of what is in snap in terms of programs that get renewed or don't get renewed. If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend five more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every two or three days to pick up their fresh items and that affects the items in the basket. ","So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving. In terms of the competitors, I don't know that there's too much I can add from what I -- Mike and I mentioned before. Overall, I wouldn't say that we're seeing a huge difference. If you go back and look, you have competitors that had gone out of business that now stores have been reopened in some parts of the country. You have all kinds of different things going on. And to make a blanket statement or -- a blanket statement toward a specific competitor, that, I don't think it would be helpful because I really don't see it changing massively when you look at big groups. I don't know, Mike, anything you would want to add to that?","Mike Schlotman","Yeah. I would agree with you.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just slide one more fast one in here. Just with the kind of the next two years or so of annual CapEx kind of getting back to that sub-4 mark, just any other color that you can give us all in terms of where versus what you have been planning when it was over the 4 range, kind of where some differences may lie?","Mike Schlotman","Well, we've obviously done a lot of work at this point in the year to pare back capital spending in the current fiscal year because you have projects in the pipeline. There are certain projects that will slide into the next fiscal year and then projects from '17 that will slide into '18 probably. And I'll remind you that our -- a few of the $500 million reduction is for this year and next year. Well, for this year and then keeping next year in the same range as this year, we just think it's prudent in this environment to maintain and increase our financial flexibility to respond to the environment that's out there and to have that incremental cash to be able to spend. ","Our view is there will always be a significant number of projects in the pipeline, and we're comfortable we're going to be able to do the projects we have the highest level of confidence in and get those built, while maintaining as much financial flexibility as we can. It's not concentrated in any one geography, particularly this year. Frankly, some of it was where did we have stores we're not legally committed to open or start projects on and we feel very good about, that level of spending will still be a record year for spending. So it's not an -- it's a very substantial investment in the business.","Rodney McMullen","The biggest effect will probably be in terms of net new stores. If you just make blanket statements in terms of where will it, but it'll be a little of everything, but that's probably the biggest bucket.","Mike Schlotman","I would agree with that.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. Very helpful. Best of luck.","Operator","And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I'm kind of just sitting back and listening to the call and trying to compare it to what we're seeing out in the marketplace and there's definitely just a little bit of a disconnect. I mean, you have your biggest competitor, Walmart, that's on the record. They were just at the Goldman Sachs conference, and I'm sure you guys see the research. I mean, they're clearly moving on price in certain geographies and have said that they are going to continue to do that. And we can also see the market share moving pretty quickly towards them. ","Then we saw Albertsons, your second biggest competitor, lowering price pretty aggressively, not in all geographies but in several of yours. But you guys say you don't see anything different. So I mean, are you hoping they just don't keep coming at you? I mean, we do see your comps now at about 0.5% and it seems like the market share has -- your market share gains have ebbed. So I'm just trying to understand the strategy a little bit better.","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at our market, we continue to gain market share in the second quarter. If you look at it from a competitive standpoint, our second biggest competitor would actually be somebody other than Albertsons. I don't remember where Albertsons is right now, but Costco would be the second largest competitor. I always think it's important to look across the whole country and what's going on, and I made the comment before about all short statement. All short statements in economics are wrong. And there, you can see behavior, all kinds of different behavior across the country, what competitors are going to do. Your guess is as good as ours would be in terms of whether that's something they're going to do everywhere or if that's something they're testing or -- and what speed does it take for them to do it everywhere. I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add?","Mike Schlotman","I agree. And keep in mind, when you think about what competitors are doing, it's not like our prices have remained stable or increased. We continue to invest in price as well.","Scott Mushkin","So I mean, I guess, last quarter, I asked Rodney that if Walmart did follow through, what would you do, would you continue to keep your gap where it's gone, which is lower. It's been lower over the last several years, it's pretty narrow in the mid-single digits in a lot of markets, not every market. It seems like now, you seem okay at least in certain markets with that gap to move up maybe back into the mid-teens, and I'm just again, I would push on why.","Rodney McMullen","I would challenge your comment because first of all, we would not publicly say what we're going to do from a competitive standpoint in advance of doing it because I think the FTC would probably get a little upset with us along with, I know, our general counsel would be. And I did not say that we would be comfortable with any specific number, and you were the -- and you gave the specific numbers that you speculate what that is. I would go back to the comments that Mike and I made before. We continue to execute our strategy. There's parts of the strategy that's more important than just price. It really is everything all together. To say, to react to specific comments, I think, would be very difficult. And how you look at a basket of goods may be different than now a customer looks at a basket of goods as well.","Mike Schlotman","One of the other things that continues to fascinate me with all the conversation about investing in price or not investing in price, 18 months ago, all the questions I was getting is, why do you guys continue to invest in price, why don't you let your gross margins go up? You've closed the gap everywhere and now you can reap the benefits of what you've sown. And we've staunchly said for years we're going to continue to invest in price because if you look at any segment of retailing, over any period of time, gross margins always decline, and we'll continue to maintain our financial flexibility and execute our customer first strategy and invest not only in price, but the three other elements of it as well.","Scott Mushkin","And then just one last quick one. Are you guys happy with where your market share gains are so far in the third quarter? And then I'll yield. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Well, looking at market share gains, I don't think it's -- the data isn't quick enough to be able to answer where we are so far in the third quarter on market share gains. And I actually couldn't answer the question because we wouldn't have the data yet from the market. And we look at market share by looking at Nielsen data, IRI data and other sources. Thanks, Scott.","Scott Mushkin","All right, guys. Good luck. Thanks.","Operator","And the next question is from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I apologize ahead of time. I'm going to ask a couple of quick clarifications. I hope you answer them. On the deflation, can you give us some insight on -- I get the meat deflation and the commodity-driven deflation. But can you give us some insight, as you rolled from the first quarter and into the second quarter, did the deflation spread out significantly in the center of store? And are you seeing and expecting deflation in sort of the CPG-driven part of your business? That's one clarification I'm looking for.","Mike Schlotman","It certainly did pick up in the grocery category in the second quarter as far as more deflation. The other thing that's happened, and I said this actually earlier today when I was on CNBC, if you look at produce, it wasn't deflationary in the quarter, but it was -- there was this inflation in produce in the second quarter. So it was less inflationary in the second quarter than the first quarter, so we were -- it's fairly broad based.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, but if you look within grocery, it's heavily driven by the dairy category, which is obviously mostly milk. Eggs is a huge part of that. So if you look at the acceleration, it's really being driven by a few select items within it.","Mike Schlotman","Fair point.","Robby Ohmes","And then my second clarification is if you look at the natural organic category within your store, whether it's looking at it at Simple Truth or looking at the natural organic brands that you've now been carrying for a while, is natural organic deflating right now?","Rodney McMullen","It would only be in terms of the areas that are commodity driven. So if you look at eggs, eggs is kind of fascinating because there wasn't as much inflation a year ago in eggs that were organic eggs. So the deflation there isn't as much. It's because they didn't inflate as much. Milk would be a little bit. But if you look at the alternatives in terms of grain-based milks, really not so much there. I don't know, Mike, any --","Mike Schlotman","I agree with you.","Robby Ohmes","That's great. And just last one, not a deflation question. Can you just give us a sense of Simple Truth momentum and penetration and remind us where that's at?","Mike Schlotman","We continue to be thrilled with Simple Truth. It continues to grow as a brand. More and more households continue to enter into the category and just stay in the category. Our corporate brand folks continue to do a great job of expanding the category with incremental products in the category as well. It's really the cornerstone of our natural and organic program.","Rodney McMullen","And it would continue to be growing at close to double digits, especially if you don't include chicken because there's quite a bit of deflation in chicken.","Robby Ohmes","Got it. Terrific. Thanks, guys.","Rodney McMullen","We have time for one more question.","Operator","And the next question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just in regards to your 8% to 11% long-term earnings guidance, would you expect to return to that range in 2017? And the follow-up to that is, what gives you comfort in that level of earnings growth, especially since many folks are worried that the promotional environment will intensify down the road?","Rodney McMullen","I wouldn't feel comfortable telling you the specific time until we give 2017 guidance. So -- and I don't want to think we want to go ahead and give '17 guidance now. And we really look at it over a rolling three to five-year period of time. And if you look at it historically, we've actually grown in -- well in excess of the 11% over a three-year period of time and a five-year period of time, both on the quarter and the annual basis. So it really is -- when you look at the overall ability to connect with the customers, that's why we feel comfortable with that 8% to 11%. We still see tremendous opportunities to improve the way we connect with customers and the way we run our business. ","And you guys hear me say often that our to-do list remains bigger than our done list, and that certainly remains the case. And that's the reason why we remain confident in the 8% to 11% plus a dividend that's increasing over time, is that we still see plenty of opportunities to grow the business, connect with a customer in a deeper way and to continue to run our business better. And it's one of the things that's exciting every time you figure out something that you could do better and you do it, it helps you learn how to do something else better. So that's the reason why we get excited. At this point, I wouldn't feel comfortable to give you the specific period of time and obviously, at some point, we'll give some guidance on '17, but it's really too early at this point.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. Just a couple of quick clarifications as well. On the taxes, the employee share-based payment, is that a onetime thing? I mean, should we expect the 35% tax rate going forward into '17?","Mike Schlotman","Yeah. It's purely driven by how many stock options wind up getting exercised in any time frame and a reclassification from an accounting standpoint where the benefit of that goes in the financial statements.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. And last one for me. Just you've given guidance on fuel gross margins in the past. I think you've previously said it would be at or below the 5-year average. Is that still your view for this year?","Mike Schlotman","Our view for the rest of the year is it will continue to -- on a rolling four quarters basis, it will continue to trend down from where we finished the quarter, and I wouldn't see that expectation any different. We had a very, very strong fuel quarter last year. It's actually held up better so far this year than we thought. We finished the rolling four quarters at the end of the second quarter at $0.184. That was down $0.002 from last year. We would expect that downward trend to continue a little.","Alvin Concepcion","Great. Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Alvin. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. I want to thank the many associates sharing in the Kroger journey. We have six generations working with us today. Each associate makes a unique contribution. You bring your energy and ideas, your experiences and expertise. We are a better company because you've made Kroger the place where you want to be and work. Even as we've grown and gotten bigger as a company, I know that when the doors open and the lights go on at our stores, offices, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, everyone is giving their best to our customers, our company and each other. That means a lot and that will make all the difference. Thank you for everything that you do for our customers every day. ","That completes our call today.

Thank you.","We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2014 investor conference in Cincinnati, beginning on the evening of October 28 and ending early afternoon on October 29. Details will be coming soon and we are looking forward to seeing many of you then.","I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer, and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Kroger achieved a strong and balanced second quarter as we improved our connection with customers. We are also executing our growth plan and delivering on our key performance indicators all of which is fueling strong financial results for our shareholders.","Our second quarter performance highlights Kroger's continued growth momentum. We continue to deliver on the performance targets we outlined at our October 2012 Investor Conference including positive identical store sales growth, slightly expanding rolling four quarters, FIFO operating margins excluding fuel, and improving return on invested capital.","For the period, we achieved our 43rd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margins without fuel on a rolling four quarter basis. And we increased our return on invested capital while also increasing capital investment.","Based on our strong quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share guidance and our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. We expect to deliver a net earnings per diluted share growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal 2014. As you know, this is partially due to the benefit of Harris Teeter. We expect to return to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% plus the dividend in fiscal 2012 -- 2015, sorry. Thanks, Cindy. And we are not done growing and differentiating to better serve our customers.","We are proud to welcome the incredible Vitacost.com team to the Kroger family. We are excited about the opportunity the merger creates to transform the customer experience and move Kroger directly into the e-commerce space much faster than we could have done on our own. The merger closed last month and our teams are hard at work developing our combined business plan. Mike Ellis will have more to say about Vitacost in a few minutes.","Our merger with Harris Teeter is going very well and we are learning a lot from each other and we can't say enough great things about our Harris Teeter associates.","We continue to see positive indicators in customer shopping behavior both what our customers tell us and what their actual shopping behavior says. Kroger's data suggests some greater confidence in the economy and less caution in spending consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Even so, confidence in the economy and the economic recovery is not pervasive across the board. Many of our customers are still struggling and we continue to pursue our strategy of connecting meaningfully with all customers wherever they are in the economic spectrum.","It is worth noting that our definition of a loyal customer is based on a combination of how often a customer shops with us and the amount of products they purchase from Kroger. We have loyal customers in every segment of the customer spectrum, from value customers to upscale shoppers and everywhere in between. We continue to see our loyal households grow at a faster rate than total households.","As you know, we developed the four keys of our customer first strategy more than 10 years ago. Because we recognize that customers wanted a grocery retailer that would deliver not just one or two key advantages, but a total combination including a great overall shopping experience, excellent customer service, a full assortment of both national and corporate brand products and everyday low prices and promotional offerings.","Today our customer research tells us that this is even more important. Our customers don't want to compromise by choosing retailers who do only well in only one or two areas. In short, customers are looking for a food retailer that can offer it all. And that is Kroger's sweet spot. That is exactly where we've positioned ourselves to win. It is where we are winning. And it is where we intend to continue to win.","Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?","Mike Ellis","Thanks Rodney. Good morning, everyone.","First I'd like to thank our associates for their solid performance. Strong and consistent execution is what allows us to continue making investments in all the four keys of our customer first strategy including investments in our associates and ongoing price investment.","As Rodney said, loyal households grew at a faster rate than total households which also grew for the quarter. This is important because it tells us that we are connecting with our customers across the entire spectrum and that we are connecting in the right areas: people, products and shopping experience and price.","As expected inflation continued to increase during the quarter especially in meat, dairy and in pharmacy, which continued to produce solid growth in both script count and ID sales. We estimate inflation excluding fuel and pharmacy was 2.4% in the second quarter and 2.8% with pharmacy. Even with higher inflation we saw strong tonnage growth during the second quarter.","Our corporate brands portfolio continues to resonate with our customers. During the second quarter corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of total units sold and 25.2% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. We saw strong double-digit unit and sales growth in Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic. Our new entry-level price point brands and premium tier private selection brand all had strong positive sales and unit gains in the second quarter as well.","Another driver of sustainable growth is customer first innovation. For the past few quarters we have highlighted innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter I would like to focus on our merger with Vitacost.com.","First I'd like to echo Rodney's welcome to the Vitacost team. You're now part of team Kroger and we couldn't be more excited about that. This is a compelling transaction because of the incredible potential for transformation and growth. We believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to blend the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience. Vitacost people and extensive e-commerce platform coupled with Kroger's customer insights and loyal customer base will really be a powerful combination that we can leverage to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers. We intend to build on Vitacost's robust technology platform and integrate it with our existing digital footprint to do just that.","This is one of the reasons we recently asked Kevin Dougherty, who has been serving as Kroger's Group Vice President and Chief Supply-Chain Officer to lead this effort in a new role as Group Vice President of Digital and Vitacost. Kevin has been a leader on the Vitacost merger team from the beginning and for the past several years he has been increasingly focused on building our digital organization here at Kroger. We look forward to combining our teams to do great things for our customers, together.","Now I'd like to provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations covering Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Cincinnati and Dayton. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in New Mexico, Toledo, and agreements with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective growing Kroger's business and profitably which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and really enhance job security for our associates.","Now, Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.","Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We're very pleased with our second quarter ID sales growth of 4.8%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. Our natural foods department continues to grow in the double digits accelerated by significant household gains. Rolling four quarters FIFO operating margins excluding fuel and adjustment items expanded by 7 basis points. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margins growth rate excluding fuel to return to slightly expanding on a rolling four quarters basis.","The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a rolling four quarters basis excluding adjustment items of 13.6% which was an increase from 13.5% in the same period last year. Increased capital investments will make it more difficult to grow ROIC in the near-term. However, we expect these investments to be accretive to ROIC as they mature. We expect our year-end ROIC which will factor in a full year of increased capital investments and fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation to show a slight decline compared to the end of fiscal 2013.","Now I'll share our second quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter and Kroger's statement of operations so year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $347 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $317 million or $0.60 per diluted share.","As Mike said we are seeing higher inflation than originally anticipated. We recorded a $26 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating LIFO for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million. As reported this morning, we are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $100 million, which is an incremental penny charge to net earnings per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 for the full year.","As we have mentioned in the past, we managed the company without regard to our LIFO charge and many of the items we discussed are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for every given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. Typically a higher LIFO charge would be a headwind to results but our strong sales helped us overcome the higher than expected charge and increase our guidance.","FIFO gross margins decreased 12 basis points from the same period last year excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation excluding retail fuel operations were essentially flat as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Increases in workers compensation and general liability reserves negatively affected this comparison by 8 basis points.","Now for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the second quarter are cents per gallon fuel margins was approximately $0.18 compared to $0.165 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Achieving a 2 to 2.2x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid-to late 2015 remains a key objective.","Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has not yet realized a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA. This has caused a significant increase in the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio which is 2.33 as of the close of the second quarter compared to 1.77 during the same period last year. This is however, an improvement from the 2.42 we reported last quarter.","Kroger's net total debt is $11.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from a year ago. This includes the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and the share repurchases activity so far this year. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters.","During the second quarter Kroger repurchased 1.6 million common shares for a total investment of $78 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization in June \u2013 granted in June is still available.","Capital investments excluding mergers acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities totaled $672 million for the second quarter compared to $507 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range including Harris Teeter for fiscal 2014.","Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2014. Based on our strong second quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.22 to $3.28 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance remains 8% to 11% and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time.","We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance excluding fuel to 3.5% to 4.25% for fiscal 2014, the previous guidance was 3% to 4%. We're optimistic as we look forward to the remainder of the year, but keep in mind we had a very strong fourth quarter last year to compare to.","Now I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. I've said this before. This is an exciting time to be at Kroger. We are accelerating growth in our core business and investing in unique competitive positioning for today and the future. Integration with Harris Teeter is going exactly the way we would hope and we continue to learn from each other in ways to improve our customers' experiences.","We see transformational potential in Vitacost's e-commerce platform. We are currently hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 positions in our supermarkets stores. Next week, we will open our 2000 fuel centers location and we are well on our way to exceeding our long-term earnings per share growth rate for fiscal 2014.","Now, we look forward to answering your questions. Laura, we'll take our questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","It's John Heinbockel. So two questions. Number one, how much of the inflation that you saw in the quarter do you think you actually pass through maybe on a percent basis you pass 50% of it through or 75 or what's the general thought there? And then given Rodney, your comments about the economy I would think you probably could get a lot more of that pass-through here in the third quarter or was that not right?","Rodney McMullen","On your second question, I wouldn't necessarily agree or disagree with that. And as you know, inflation you really do have to look at it item by item. And as Mike mentioned, even with the inflation we still had strong tonnage growth and we're very happy with the results in total. A lot of the inflation right now in the perishable areas, the fresh departments, and that as you know is very seasonal. And if you look at like some of the produce inflation, as soon as the next crop comes on that could heavily affect it.","On a percentage, I would hesitate to give it because on some areas, we feel comfortable we\u2019re probably past 100%, others not so. And as you know, overall as I mentioned tonnage is strong. We continue to reduce our pricing for our customers as we take costs out of the business to do that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then secondly, if you think about Harris Teeter, how much scope is there for that organization to accelerate unit growth? I know there's a lot of potential for new stores, but I know that spread out over more years. Can they accelerate unit growth? And if they can if there's the capacity to do that given the lead time on real estate when would that be? Is that a 2016 or 2017 timeframe or sooner? ","Mike Ellis","John, I think you'll see Harris Teeter have a little bit higher store growth over the next several years than they otherwise would have. They had a lot of projects in the pipeline as the two companies came together with the merger. And the nice thing about joining Kroger for them is it gives them a little bit more capital capacity to be a little faster on getting some of those store projects up and running. It is true in many of the markets they operate where we have growth opportunities, the DC area, the Baltimore area, markets like that, the lead time is a little bit longer, but they've always had a very strong and forward thinking capital plan. It's really just the ability now for them to accelerate some of those a little faster than they may have on their own. So we would expect that their unit growth will kick up from where it has been historically.","Mike Schlotman","On average, the lead time is probably what, one to two years longer than what we've been traditionally used to unless you go to the West Coast.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks John.","Operator","And our next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to dive a little deeper into your expenses for the quarter. Compared to the past few quarters we saw less expense leverage and I know you guys called out the more difficult comparison. Was there anything else that was unusual this quarter and were the expenses in line with your internal plans?","Mike Schlotman","They were generally in line with our internal plans. The item that we called out in both that I just spoke of in the conference call some increases in workers\u2019 comp and general liability reserves, a little bit of increase for this year as well as some prior year increases in the allowances for that caused about an 8 basis point negative effect on the OG&A lines. So we would have had a little bit better improvement, we would have shown some improvement if not for the need to increase those allowances and I can tell you that is certainly a point of focus for our operators and our loss prevention folks. The key to that isn't the dollars it's making sure the accidents never happen.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Okay. Then shifting to e-commerce, we've seen a lot more noise lately whether it's from Amazon or Whole Foods and some of your competitors and you guys have clearly made investments in Vitacost. I mean how do you feel about your current capabilities versus the competition right now?","Rodney McMullen","It's a good question. I would say we feel very good but we're not satisfied. And the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel increasingly happy about what we're seeing. As you know, it's one of the things when we merged with Harris Teeter that we were really excited about. They have an incredibly strong click and collect operation that we're spending a lot of time on. And as you know when we announced merging with Vitacost, they have a great group of people from a talent perspective and a great infrastructure that we think we can grow off and expand.","So I feel very comfortable where we are positioned from a food standpoint relative to our competition. I feel even more excited about some of the things that we put in place to take advantage of the future. I don't know, Mike or Mike if you want to add\u2026?","Mike Ellis","Nothing other than the fact that the merger just closed a month ago and we are working hard to bring both companies together and see all the benefits we can come up with here.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","All right. Thank you. Good luck next quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Hi.","Rodney McMullen","Hi.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","I just wanted to dive a little bit into gross margins. So obviously, there's been a lot of news and press about Harris Teeter taking prices down and it's hard to know how much that would have impacted your gross margins on your P&L. But by my math, your core FIFO margins excluding Harris Teeter could actually have been up this quarter. Is that a fair statement? And then I guess maybe talk a bit how generics might have impacted your gross margins and other points that might be relevant.","Mike Schlotman","Relative to Harris Teeter I won't go to that level of transparency. Harris Teeter's not the only place that we continue to invest in price. It's been fairly public about the price reductions they've done and where they've done them. But we continue to refine our pricing strategy in all the geographies that we operate. And our goal always remains to grow our operating profit margins on a rolling four quarter basis slightly. We were 7 basis points and I've never given a specific number although Rodney and Cindy both kidded me a little bit yesterday that I've always said by that it's a handful or less and most people can count how many digits are on both of my hands and it would be one hand not two.","So that's why we said we actually exceeded that goal a little bit this time and that's as you know what we always focus on and when we get the operating leverage, we can accelerate things that we plan to do later and if things aren't quite trending the way we want to grow operating profit margin we can slow a few things down, we become very nimble in that arena which has been a huge help.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Okay. So then just on your quarter in general did you guys -- you guys came in above plan in the second quarter? Is that fair to say? And then I guess it was ahead of plan on earnings. Was that more gas margin related? And I guess I'm wondering because you didn't beat the Street by much but your gross margins came in quite a bit higher. And yet you're raising your full-year guidance on the low end by $0.03?","Mike Schlotman","Well, I think it's a combination of things, Karen, the strong sales certainly are encouraging for us and that momentum is always good. If you look at everything that has happened and the fact that we've increased our LIFO charge by what will amount to $0.05 or $0.06 more charge than we expected at the beginning of the year, we have now raised our earnings guidance twice. We've now raised our ID sales guidance. It's the combination of those factors that has allowed us to remain quite positive.","There were \u2013 while we only beat the Street by $0.01, LIFO cost us $0.01. And the 8 basis points from workers\u2019 comp and general liability would've been somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02, probably at least $0.02 depending on how things round. So despite those headwinds the underlying strength of our core businesses we're very happy with.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","And the top line strength has continued into the third quarter?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. So far through the third quarter, it's very similar to where we were in the first and second quarters, and pleased with the continued progress.","Karen Short - Deutsche Bank","Great. Thanks very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Karen.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Good morning everyone. Nice quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Chuck. Thank you.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If we look at the P&L just for the third quarter, are there any Vitacost acquisitions expenses worth calling out, Mike?","Mike Schlotman","We haven't really called out any merger related expenses for Harris Teeter for a while. We had some actually leading up to the merger. There's been a few small ones out there, nothing amounting to much of anything although a lot of the heavy lifting on as we convert systems and maybe happen to write some of the assets off of their books that they have capitalized as we convert to our system those things might face us in the future, but those aren't cash expenditures, they're things that were spent in the past. And Vitacost is just so new, sure, there were was a handful of expenses leading up to the merger, why we use downside count so we didn't use an outside financial advisor so it's not like we had any kind of a fee to pay a third-party in that so there really wasn't much at all.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And then in your guidance for the remainder of the year, Mike, how much dilution from Vitacost is built into that number?","Mike Schlotman","It's negligible for the back half of the year. And it's certainly contemplated in our guidance. They were actually operating here very recently at very close to a breakeven kind of a level. And we have a little bit of dilution built-in but nothing dramatic that we don't think we can overcome with the strength of the underlying operations.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So something like less than $0.05 per share?","Mike Schlotman","Yes, sir. ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. Thanks.","Mike Schlotman","Less than a handful of pennies.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Less than a handful of pennies? All right.","Operator","And the next question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hey guys, most of my questions have been asked. But I just wanted to delve into the balance sheet. Mike, I know you talked about 2.33 and your 1.7, I probably get the numbers all messed up, but you want to get down to 2. But, clearly there's been a lot of activity in the space. I just wondered from your perspective, does your balance sheet right now preclude you from doing other things or would it \u2013 it's a factor or how are you thinking about your balance sheet given the fact that there has been so much activity in the space vis-\u00e0-vis M&A?","Mike Schlotman","We were 1.77 last year. We were 2.33 this year, which was 9 basis points down from the first quarter. We feel very comfortable. We're on track to get to the 2 to 2.2x. And we'll be happy at the high-end of that range. We don't necessarily have to get to the 2.0x, Scott. That's just a range we wind up giving. And I don't know that our balance sheet necessarily precludes us from doing anything.","If the right opportunity is out there and we go to the rating agencies and they understand the uniqueness of an opportunity like they clearly did with Harris Teeter. And our follow-through when we make a commitment to them, that we actually follow through on what we do whether it's how we expect to grow the dividend, how we expect to use cash flow to buy in shares, how we expect to use capital to grow our business organically.","We're very open with the rating agencies and follow-through and the commitments we make and if it's the right set of assets with the right growth opportunity like Harris Teeter was with all the new markets, I don't think we would be precluded from continuing to participate in industry consolidation.","Rodney McMullen","The other thing is the 1.77 was unusually low because we had stopped buying back stock and some other things because we had already announced the Harris Teeter merger and we wanted to position ourselves relative to being able to merge with Harris Teeter.","Mike Schlotman","That's an excellent point. We were actually out of the market on shares for quite a while as we are blacked out while we were looking at it as well so with a combination of factors.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","That's perfect and if I could have one more, I think you guys recently opened up 121,000 square foot in Athens, Georgia. And I think the comment what I read is that there's a bigger one to come down there. You guys are really the only ones opening up bigger stores even Wal-mart is shrinking what they're trying to do. Can you kind of give us a reason why you're so comfortable with opening up these large stores and what you see what maybe other people don't see?","Mike Ellis","Well, we've had good success with our marketplace format. It is driving a lot of our sales and growth right now. So really pleased with how they are performing. Although we are still working on small format stores, we're doing some work and research around that. So really trying to stay open to what's the customer looking for in terms of a shopping experience. And so far they've been really pleased with the selection that we have in the big store. And we're really pleased with the results.","Rodney McMullen","When we look at our customer first tracker, customers can rate us very high in our marketplace stores. So it's really the combination of our associates and their connection with our customers and what we've put inside those boxes really connect well with the customer.","And I realize 120,000 square feet, it depends on where you start from it's a good-sized store, but it's not so big that you can't manage getting around the store reasonably easy either. And it gives you a lot of flexibility from a space utilization standpoint. And obviously, the key is making sure what you put in it, it's exciting and something the customer wants.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Scott.","Operator","And the next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my question.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Wanted to ask a little bit more about Harris Teeter. If you guys can give further color in terms of the order online pick up at store capability that obviously was one of the big draws from Harris Teeter. Where are you in that process today? And any color that you can give in terms of maybe as you roll that capability out further?","Rodney McMullen","It's still pretty early in the process. I can tell you that our teams have spent a ton of energy, but it's not something that we are to a point of announcing publicly. But, I can tell you we're progressing along and we're very pleased with where we are. And we're very pleased with the progress that Harris Teeter continues to make as well. I don't know \u2013 okay\u2026","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","On \u2013 in the Harris Teeter brand itself, has there been further rollout?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. Harris Teeter has continued to roll it out and they've continued to have strong growth in where they already have it, so it's really both pieces.","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. Thanks and just a quick follow-up switching over to Vitacost. I know obviously also very early in the stages, but any color that you can give in terms of when it was announced you said that of the 45,000 SKUs that Vitacost carries, you had about 10,000 overlap. Any work that's been done so far that you can just kind of incrementally share in terms of maybe what some of those other products when we may start to see them flowing onto the shelves throughout your banners, your other banners?","Mike Ellis","Well again, we just really closed the transaction and we're right in the middle of putting plans together and going through all of the steps that you would during a merger of this sort and size. And really trying to develop our plans for the future and how do we grow the platform, the Vitacost business? And we're learning a lot from Vitacost on what to do within the Kroger footprint also. So we're still in that discovery phase, but there is a lot going on and we're learning every day that there's more to learn.","Vincent Sinisi - Morgan Stanley","Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Good luck.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Vincent.","Operator","Ad our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Morning. Thanks for taking my question. For Rodney or Mike and Mike, the guidance obviously implies a little bit of a slowdown in the ID sales x fuel in the back half. Can you guys just maybe talk about why ID's would slow? Maybe what some of the support was? Is your expectation of support from fuel rewards potentially slowing? Is there an expectation of less benefit from inflation, or is there an expectation that tonnage could slow? Just sort of any color we could should think about as far as your opportunity to continue to beat those ID guidance you're giving us? Thanks.","Mike Ellis","Thanks, Robert. First of all obviously we're going to strive to make sure the identicals are as strong as we can. If you remember the fourth quarter of last year we had a lot of whether benefits. We didn't really talk about it that much in the earnings call, but there were quite a bit of weather benefits. Until you actually have it, you don't know whether it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind.","So really the biggest reason for the conservatism in identical guidance would be really cycling fourth quarter last year and not knowing how weather would be. It's really nothing should read anything in it other than that. So we really don't see inflation changing that much. We really don't see the economy changing that much. We're not seeing customer behavior changing either.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then in terms of the sort of contribution from fuel rewards has that been healthy and is that expected to continue to incrementally support ID's as well?","Rodney McMullen","It's a great question and it's a little harder to answer because it's hard to isolate just one piece and what it does for identicals. It's really the whole shopping experience so we continue to make progress on the freshness of our product. Our associates continue to make progress on connecting with their customers from a friendliness standpoint.","So it's really hard to say this piece of improvement causes this much of the identicals. Overall, as you know it's just one more reason for somebody to shop at Kroger and it's part of the overall package of what we're trying to deliver for our customer.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Robert.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO.","Kelly Bania - BMO","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about category performance. I think you mentioned a little bit on private label, but I think if I'm correct, correct me if I'm wrong that you had been trending with all departments kind of in the positive territory. So just curious, if you had any update on that.","Mike Ellis","It was a well-rounded quarter. Corporate brands had a very nice quarter. If there was any pickup at all in and it's not even a hiccup, but obviously, the high dairy prices has an influence on how many units of milk wind up getting sold. So that was a bit of headwind on corporate brands because so much of the milk that we sell is processed in our own dairies. But tonnage overall was very, very strong. All departments had positive ID sales. All geographies had positive ID sales and once again natural foods would have been the leader in the departments with continued double-digit ID sales growth in that department.","Rodney McMullen","Pharmacy was strong. A lot of departments were strong.","Mike Ellis","Good broad-based performance.","Kelly Bania - BMO","Great. That's very helpful. And then just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the signs of the less cautious behavior that you're seeing and sounds like most parts of your store. Is that more any trading up activity, is it more items you're seeing in the basket? Is it less focused on couponing and promotions? Or just any color you can provide would be helpful.","Mike Ellis","It's as much an art as it is a science. But it's looking at things that would be discretionary. What kind of performance are we having there, so if you think about Starbucks, or Boar's Head, some of our cheeses, some of our upscale items, customers continue to engage in a much more positive way than before. And that's performance that's year-on-year.","Also if you look at some of the non-foods, general jewelry, all those types of discretionary items, customers continue to be willing to spend money. And then we also survey our customers on their perception and customers are continuing to tell us they feel the economy is a little bit better, but they continue to be nervous in terms of their outlook on things. So it's cautious optimism, I think is probably the best way to put it.","Kelly Bania - BMO","Thanks. ","Mike Ellis","Thanks Kelly.","Operator","The next questioner is Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Good morning everyone. I have two questions if I can. You slipped in a mention of DC Baltimore today. Can you update us on what your plan is for your expansion into new markets where you're most focused? You're looking to hire 20,000 new permanent employees. Is that a sign you are getting closer to that, or is that not the right way to look at the press release?","Mike Ellis","I wouldn't say the 20,000 new hires really has anything to do with any announcement of going into new geography. Those are by and large, almost entirely if not completely jobs that are open today and geographies where we already operate or have plans over the next year to open stores in existing geographies. So those are actual current needs we have to have to fully staff our stores to the level we want staffed and be able to have schedules written the way we need them written and our associates want to work inside of our stores. We continue to think about our new market activity a lot of activity going on around that. But we aren't going to be premature in announcing where that's maybe.","Rodney McMullen","Obviously merging with Harris Teeter put us in a lot of new markets.","Mike Ellis","A lot of new markets. And relevant to the earlier question that I think John asked, we would expect they're relatively new to DC Baltimore, so for Harris Teeter, those were new markets and there are significant opportunities to increase our footprint in those markets.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay. And then the drought in California, it continues to become I guess more worrisome. So as you think about some of the fruits and nuts and so forth that you source from there. I mean you look into next year some of these items might be in shorter supply. Are you planning more differently than what you might usually do? Do you have options from other geographies? If I guess certain items from the U.S. are harder to find, or is it just too early to even think about that?","Mike Ellis","I think it's probably too early to think about that although we have the same sort of issue whether it's orange juice from Florida, or other commodities from around the world that we'll have short supply from time to time and we just have to deal with that as best we can. And we buy from around the world in so many cases today whether it's in the fresh departments or other parts of our business. So we just have to deal with that as it comes, I think.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","All right. Thanks everyone.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Ken.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes. Thanks and good morning. So you're not showing organic sales growth has remained obviously pretty consistent here and strong. I'm curious how you're thinking today about this notion of the industry may be reaching a point where there's too much supply at retail for demand? Or do you think instead that the piece of the pie in terms of people interested in natural and organic is only continuing to broaden and deepen?","Mike Ellis","Well, it appears to us that the natural organic customer is changing and growing in numbers. And those that shop the grocery store are also crossing over and the blurring of grocery and natural foods is becoming more and more difficult when you look around the store and you can see organic items on the regular grocery shelves. So it seems that the customer base is getting much larger for these types of products. I don't know where the end is. It might be a lifestyle change for our customers that they are just deciding to eat better. And make different choices for their families, but we love the growth and we're going to continue to make sure that we have the products our customers looking for.","Rodney McMullen","We don't find that customer's an either\/or shopper. There's a small percentage of customers that are only organic and natural, but most of our customer base actually buys across the whole store.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","I guess that was my follow-up. Do you have any data that you can share on what percent of your customers are buying some natural organic products today and maybe how many just started over the past couple of years? Or maybe even what type of households where you're seeing the most growth in the category in terms of whether it's middle income or upper middle incomes anything that you can share on that would be really helpful.","Rodney McMullen","It would be well over half our customers would buy something. That continues to increase. And the thing that I think is so hard is there's a lot of product innovation in that space as well. So some of the customers maybe buying products there, because of the innovation not necessarily because of organic or natural. It's just because it's a new item and it tastes good. So how much of it is driven by one piece versus the other? I think it would be just speculation.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","Interesting. And anything in terms of the sort of household income profile? Are you seeing that kind of dip down into the middle incomes or where you're seeing kind of the most growth?","Rodney McMullen","It's really all customer types. It's not exclusive to one specific customer might by no means.","Kate Wendt - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Kate.","Operator","And our next is from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi Securities","Yes. Good morning. Many thanks for taking my call. Actually I have two questions this morning if I may. First one is for Michael Schlotman. Michael, if I look at your outstanding debt, still a few items with high coupons. Can you maybe conceptually talk about how you think about liability management?","And then my question for Rodney is kind of a follow-up on an earlier question with regard to smaller store formats. We are obviously monitoring with great interest the Family Dollar saga. We're also monitoring what's going on in the U.K. market where companies like Wm Morrison are using convenience stores as a way to compete with all these and the leaders of the world. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about the convenience store format? Is that something that down the road may be part of your plans or you're still very happy with your current portfolio? Many thanks. ","Mike Schlotman","Okay. If you look at the smaller stores, obviously we've been in the convenience store itself for years and years and years. It came to Kroger when we merged with Dillon. We would look at \u2013 we are following Dollar General Family Dollar everyday as well. We consider both of them competitors. I can tell you all of us get into those stores on a regular basis trying to learn what they do and how they connect with their customer and what are they doing good and what can we learn from them?","And we think it will be important over time to have even a smaller store that's part of the profile that's probably a convenient store, not necessarily a convenience store. But it's something we continue to work on. We haven't figured out how to make money the way we'd like to make money there. But we haven't given up either. Mike, do you want to talk about the debt?","Mike Ellis","From a liability management standpoint, Philippe, we constantly look at some of those higher coupon pieces of debt that are out there. Many of those are 30-year debt, what was 30-year debt at the time we issued it. When we look at the net present value of making a tender offer for those, it just doesn't often come out where it's an NPV positive on a cash flow basis. It may help accretion. It may be accretive to earnings per share on that basis. But the upfront amount you have to pay because of the premium that they'd be trading at, you wind up spending a lot of cash upfront.","So we'll constantly look at it. I wouldn't say we have any plans in the near-term to do anything about them and our approach has been over time to continue to manage our liability and have dollars coming due every year. So we can be accessing the markets on a regular basis. We've actually taken a few hundred basis points out of our average interest portfolio.","When we look at upcoming debt issuance activity, we do often times enter into hedging agreements to lock in current interest rates and in advance of actually issuing the debt. And as we get closer to those, that is a type of transaction we often use.","Filippe Goossens - Mitsubishi Securities","Great. Thank you very much, Michael and look forward to seeing you next week, then. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Mike Schlotman","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Hi. Good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Your comments that the recovery has not really been pervasive across the board if you also look across at the discounters that have not been showing strong grocery performance, it sounds like the weakness is really in that lowest income customer bracket. Is that true? And can give us some insight on what's going on with that group are they just not responding to lower pricing at this point?","Rodney McMullen","Well, I would say that we're very happy with how we are connecting with that customer. If you look at their economic situation, incomes have been very slow to recover. And employment has been slow to recover. So it's really when I make the comment it's referring to the situation they're in. And we continue to try to make sure that we're able to address pricing and help their budget go further both on the introduction of more entry price point items, and absolutely just lowering pricing too. So we're very happy with our performance for that customer segment, but that customer segment continues to be under a lot of economic strain.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. Great. And then switching over to store growth, you've done a lot of consolidation of underperforming stores in recent years and that's put some pressure on your net store growth. But it sounds like you're coming to some end of that process. Is there a square footage growth rate you can commit to in future years that's a little more robust?","Mike Schlotman","I incorrectly predicted last year that our absent Harris Teeter that our unit growth would expand a little bit. So I'll probably be hesitant to repeat that great prognostication here. Obviously, we've been very aggressive on trimming some of the underperforming assets of our portfolio which has slowed our store count. The question earlier on an average store opening up at 121,000 square feet there are times that was not a case, but there are times where we opened a store like that and then may replace a couple of 40,000 or 50,000 square foot stores. So our square footage actually goes up, but our store count goes down by one as a result.","I think going forward, if our guidance has been in the range of 2% of square footage growth excluding the operational closings. And I don't want to get married to a square footage growth on a net basis and not make the right decision on operationally closing a store. So we kind of look at our investments in new relocated and expanded stores separately from what activity should happen on operational closings and looking at those separately. So we continue to increase capital, we'll increase it $200 million next year. Would expect to open up more stores next year than this year and I think it will be a continued progression up in both our store count and our square footage.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","So improving but something under 2% it sounds like?","Mike Schlotman","On a net basis I would think so. Yes.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. Okay. And then lastly -- ","Mike Schlotman","But Mark keep in mind, that square footage is significantly more productive when you look at on a sales per square footage basis. We're up roughly 50% on improvements in productivity in our stores since we started this customer first journey 10 years a go. At the end of the day I'd rather have more productive square footage than more square footage that's a little less productive.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. And then, lastly as you're looking at click and collect and some of the other models, maybe you could comment's a little on some of these personal shopping services that are out there from third parties, have you looked at the Instacart and the Google Express and some of these other ones that are out there? What are your thoughts there?","Rodney McMullen","You should be very comfortable that we've looked at all of them. And it's really trying to make sure we understand what our customers' wants and needs are. Some of the places where we believe that will be more successful our places where we don't have stores, but it is something we continue to look at and evaluate and look at partnering with as appropriate.","Mark Wiltamuth - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mark.","Operator","And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Good morning. I wanted to go back to comment about ROIC and the fact that there are a lot of investments not just including Harris Teeter, but other investments that are dampening it now, but we will see improvement. And I was just wondering, if you can give us a better sense of not specific numbers, but kind of in terms of magnitude, whether we're talking about remodels, new stores, and then a sense of how we should expect the benefits of those investments to flow in? Is it going to be 2015 or is there more in 2016? How is that all going to work out?","Mike Schlotman","Meredith, absent the Harris Teeter being in there for a full year this year and if you can think about how an ROIC calculation works and we started to go down this path in the conference call and took the language out. So I guess I'll go down it in a Q&A. Right now we only have half of the Harris Teeter assets in the calculation because it's a beginning of the year and end of the year average assets that you return is calculated on.","So right now it's about half of years of EBITDA and half of their assets. If you think about an ROIC number for Harris Teeter based on the purchase price it would have been an ROIC number below what Kroger have been generating. So a full year of Harris Teeter in here will reset the bar for ROIC slightly. It won't be dramatically lower, but we do expect it to be a little bit lower. Absent that, even with the increased CapEx we've been investing in the business, we would have expected ROIC to grow slightly albeit somewhat slowly as we ramp this up.","You typically see a couple to three year lag and a better growth of ROIC as you begin to increase your capital expenditures. So we're about midway into that two to three-year timeframe so sometime in 2015, 2016 we should start to see a bigger benefit from those investments we've made 18 months ago and are starting to mature now and they'll overwhelm the new investments we make in 2015 and 2016 from a return standpoint.","Rodney McMullen","Typically on expansions in new stores, Mike, and the first year actually hurts ROIC. The second year it gets almost neutral, but hurts a little third year, it starts helping.","Mike Schlotman","Right.","Rodney McMullen","If you look at our maturity.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. And when you look at the performance of the projects that you've done, are they all following the pro formas that you had built? You feel like are they beating them?","Mike Schlotman","Well, it's like anything. All would be an overstatement of all hitting that overperforming, it's a mixed bag. Some are a little below. Some are exceeding it in a big way, but by and large, most of them, many of them are right at the kind of expectations we laid out. The key there will be to continue to generate the sales and the EBITDA that those stores were expected to generate. And then in turn hold our divisions accountable to give that EBITDA back to our shareholders. And either back to us to continue to invest in the business or back to the shareholders, so we can grow it. But clearly as a group, these stores are performing very well and I would say are at the point right now of exceeding our expectations as a group.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","And then my final question would be, is it right to think about this level of investment as being something that will continue? I know you don't want to talk about moving into a new market or we should receive this as sort of opportunistic and we'll see a moderation in say, 2017?","Mike Schlotman","I would not expect to see a moderation in the capital plans. We've got some great markets where we have average market shares or below average market shares when you look at some of our stronger markets. And the strong connection we see between market share and return on invested capital is one of the reasons we've gone down the fill-in strategy format. And I would expect to continue to see us having a very strong capital expenditure program.","When we laid it out in 2012, we expected a couple hundred million dollar increase for five years. And it was going to start in 2013. So that really gets you to the 2017, 2018 kind of timeframe and as we go through that process, we'll go through the report card you like you just asked on the stores we've opened and to the extent we continue to be happy with those investments as a group because in the end that's what affects our shareholders is the group. We'll make ongoing decisions about how much we'll invest in capital, but based on where we are right now, I don't see any cause for pause.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Great. Thank you very much.","Mike Schlotman","We'll have time for one more question.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Meredith.","Operator","And that question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","So as we \u2013 I guess following up on Kate's questions earlier on natural and organic, you mentioned innovation is a big part of some of the growth that you're seeing in the channel and the response from the consumer. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the number of SKUs you've added in these categories, what additional rollouts are still planned and maybe how much of the sales you think has been incremental? And then kind of as a corollary there, how you think about margin associated with this category versus other areas of the store? Thanks.","Mike Ellis","Well, in terms of incremental it's hard to say. It was a lot of switching that goes on today between natural and basic type of products. As we've mentioned, we expect our Simple Truth brand to be a $1 billion brand this year. So customers are as interested today and as engaged in natural and organic as they've ever been.","Also, we don't talk a lot about organic produce, but that's a category that continues to grow. Could probably grow faster, if supply was better, but we continue to enjoy large sales growth in that particular area.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","And so just again on the \u2013 I guess any additional SKUs that you're planning to rollout on top of what you've done already, and also how you think about the margin in these categories, I guess now and going forward? Thank you.","Mike Ellis","SKU count continues to increase. And the departments continue to grow in many cases both on the private-label side as well as the branded side. Margins I tell you what, there's more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there's ever been. It seems that it's becoming more and more of a competitive category. And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic, I don't know that's going to continue for the foreseeable future.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs","That's very helpful. Thanks so much.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you. Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the anniversary of the attacks of September 11th. We all continue to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who perished on that tragic day. And I know that many of the folks on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to honor the memory of the fallen through our support of police, firefighters, the military, and their families. On behalf of all of us here at Kroger, we want to say our heartfelt thank you to the everyday heroes who worked every day to keep us all safe.","Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. September is hunger action month. And I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our associates across the company who helped support our customers and neighbors in need. According to our partners at Feeding America, the nations largest hunger agency, there are 46.5 million Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from. Together, we are working to combat poverty in partnership with the 106 local Feeding America food banks.","Last year alone, Kroger contributed the equivalent of 200, that's right, 200 million meals nearly 4 million meals every week to feed hungry families in our community, which I just find an amazing number and my hats off to our team. Of that, our perishable donations partnership program provided more than 50 million pounds of fresh meat, produce, dairy and bakery items directly to local food banks in 2013. Our associates play a vital role in helping us get this fresh healthy food to those who need it most. Without your help and support, our perishable donations partnership would not be possible. Thank you. That completes our call for today and thanks for joining us.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions.","In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.

Mike and I really look forward to working with you in your new role in a closer basis.","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's first quarter 2018 results, is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","Restock Kroger is off to a great start, I am especially proud of our team's execution of process changes that led to strong cost controls. We are committed to knowing and serving our customers so well that Kroger serves all of their shopping needs. Our most fundamental strategy remains unchanged as customers' tastes change and their shopping habits evolve we will be there for them.","That means we will make the investments needed to provide our customers with the best full service grocery experience in America. Plus, we are investing in our associates more than ever before and seeing improvements in retention. We are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us both in-store and online.","We are actively improving the store experience. Our space optimization work is ahead of schedule and our brands achieved another period of record growth while at the same time growing our digital sales by more than 66% in the first quarter, which was due to our ongoing expansion of ClickList, our delivery initiative and identical growth.","Our first quarter results enabled us to raise the low end of our EPS guidance for the year while also setting us up well to deliver to deliver on our identical sales target range for 2018. As you know, Restock Kroger is our three-year plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats.","We are making progress in each of the four main drivers, redefining the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Using our deep insights and experience, Kroger is imagining the future of retail by building on our core business plus adding exciting and innovative partnerships like Ocado and our planned merger with Home Chef.","We believe the future of retail will include both physical and digital customer experiences. Everything we are doing today will enhance our ability to provide everyone in America with convenience of shopping for anything, anytime, anywhere. We are incredibly excited that it is Kroger who is bringing Ocado technology to the U.S. for the first time.","The platform includes online ordering automated fulfillment and home delivery capabilities, so it's a perfect fit with our vision and strategy. We look forward to innovating together with Ocado to enhance Kroger's digital and robotics capabilities. And we are already working to identify the first three sites for development of the new automated warehouse facilities in the U.S. to deploy Ocado's proprietary technology and distribution expertise.","Customers want convenience, simplicity and personalized food experience. Our planned merger with Home Chef will accelerate our ability to deliver exactly this. There is a lot that we admire about Home Chef, their creativity and entrepreneurial energy, and their use of data to connect with customers to name just a few. We believe that by taking over Kroger's meal solutions portfolio, Home Chef will bring our customers even more innovation and delicious offerings so customers can be the hero at meal time.","Pat and his team at Home Chef will be able to leverage Kroger assets both our physical stores and data to drive their business even more, and by joining forces, we can grow bigger together than either of us could have done alone. We continue to execute our digital strategy through our core business as well.","As I said before, the households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores spend more per week than households that do not. And households that purchase from us online spend even more.","We've aggressively growing our existing seamless coverage to reach approximately 75% of our customers. This includes our network of ClickList locations, stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners, as well as ship to home capabilities. Our goal is to reach a 100% of our customers with seamless experience and over time to reach all across America. All the changes we are making to transform our business will make it even easier for families to share meals together, this business strategy enables us to live our Kroger purpose because we know that family who spend share meals together have even a better relationship and if they have children they do better in all aspects of their lives.","Our brand is another example of how we are redefining the grocery customer experience. Kroger customers choose to put more of our brand in their basket and pantries every day. Our brands grew faster than the national brands in nearly every department and gain significant share overall. In the first quarter, our brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.7% of sales dollars. In fact, our brands set the record for the highest ever retail dollar share in our history. Our brands achieved a 5.1% sales growth at a 3.4% unit growth in the first quarter led by double digit growth again in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines.","Last quarter, we said that the Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would enable us to accelerate investments and Restock Kroger. This is possible because we are taking a balanced approach to how we are spending and investing the benefits. It\u2019s distributed evenly between our associates, our customers and our shareholders. This approach is in line with Kroger's purpose and is helping us make strategic investments and Develop Talent.","We are investing more than ever before in our associate experience. It all starts with the $0.5 billion investment in wages for many store associates that is part of Restock Kroger. We\u2019re also increasing the Company's 401 contribution match to help associates retire with more money in their pockets plus expanding associate discounts to keep more money in their pockets today.","The one piece that I am most excited about is Feed Your Future, our new offer of up to $3,500 in annual tuition assistance to any associate who wants to attend classes to build a better future for themselves, whether they're interested in completing a GED or an undergraduate degree, an MBA or professional certification, associates can take advantage of up to $21,000 in total assistance as long as they\u2019ve been with us for at least six months, and that\u2019s on whether they\u2019re full time or part time employee.","And someone who got their start stocking shelves on the night shift in Lexington, Kentucky for Kroger in 1978, I can attest education\u2019s life-changing power. I worked my way through college and upon graduation, I was so proud to accept a full-time job with Kroger. The incredible learning experiences and work that makes a difference in people's daily lives has kept me here ever since. Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and stay for their career.","We believe that making education benefits available to more associates and at more generous levels than ever before, is the best way to support their career and their future professional growth. And as part of Restock Kroger, we fully expect these investments will have an ROI that will create shareholder value. We are in the process of transforming our business, so that in the future we can connect with customers in ways that add more ease and convenience to their lives.","To do this and to do it profitably, we must have an economic model that supports this transformation. Kroger is better positioned than anyone to make this transformation because we have a set of unique and differentiating strengths. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads us to deep customer knowledge and unheralded personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers.","We have a leadership team that combines broad experience with creativity and diversity of thought. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. We connect personally with our associates, customers and community to uplift and improve lives and we have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program.","Because of these strengths we are on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental FIFO operating profit we committed to in Restock Kroger, we are confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.","Now, here is Mike to share more details on our first quarter and update you on our guidance for 2018. Mike.","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone, we're very pleased with our first quarter ID sales and earnings results. We did slightly better than our internal expectations. We completed the sale of our convenience stores business unit, and as Rodney said, we had one of the best cost control quarters in a long time due to implementing process changes. This is important because over the next three years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and our infrastructure.","Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make these strategic investments to grow our business. We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next three years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan. We've already reprioritized the way we will invest capital over the next three years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process.","We now look first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities across both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale these demand through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.","Our investment in Ocado is a great example of what's possible with our new approach to investing capital. We continue to aggressively managing OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. A big focus continues to be on store productivity and waste. Our team's controlled shrink in the first quarter, as we said before, we won't leave a penny on the table as we seek to reinvest savings to grow our business.","We plan to generate $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020. We're taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward into 2018, so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated. Our full forward investments in Restock Kroger began in the last four weeks of the first quarter. While the incremental 401(k) contribution match investment was retroactive the first of the year, costs to support our new associate education program feature future have not begun in earnest.","Our investments and wages will roll in as contracts are negotiated and the education payments will occur over time as associates take advantage of the opportunities to further their education. We will make investments for the rest of the year to drive our strategy and keep prices low to retain our customers. As a reminder since 2000, we've reduced prices to our customers by over $4 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit and ID sales growth while delivering on bottom line for shareholders.","We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in restock Kroger in defining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent. We paid for by costs of good savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is precisely where the incremental FIFO operating profit will come from over the next three years.","For ID sales were pleased with the result of the first quarter. Several departments outperformed the Company in the first quarter, most notably Meat, Seafood and our Floral department. Natural Foods continue to generate strong double-digit growth in the first quarter, and during the quarter, we saw growth in households and loyal households as well as unit growth.","As noted in our press release this morning we reported identical supermarket sales without fuel of 1.4%. This result was aligned with our internal expectations for the quarter. When calculating identical sales to be more inclusive of all company business units including Kroger specialty pharmacy and ship to home solutions our ID sales without fuel 1.9% in the first quarter.","We intend to use this calculation going forward as it presents a comprehensive view of our performance as we redefine the grocery customer experience, and is therefore more appropriate measure of performance. We also look at what others include in their ID calculations and have taken the steps to be more consistent with our peers report.","Our space optimization work is right on plan. We had about 30% of our plan, 600 stores completed for 2018. Space optimization will continue to be a headwind to ID sales into late third quarter. By then we will have more stores completed and maturing then in process or not yet started, which is why it will start to be a benefit to sales later in the year.","Retail fuel performance during the quarter was good again, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $18.7 compared to $17.1 in last year's first quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.65 versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. This includes convenience stores for the period prior to the divestiture.","In April, we completed the sale of our convenience store business unit for $2.15 billion. After tax proceeds with total 1.7 billion. We are returning a significant amount of the capital to shareholders through our $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we use the balance of the after-tax proceeds to lower our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio compared to the end of fiscal 2017.","Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.43 on a 52-week basis. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5 times. We expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to increase throughout the year due to increased borrowings to fund our investment in Ocado, our planned merger with Home Chef, and tax payments related to the gain from the sale of our convenience store business unit.","Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last four quarters we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pretax to company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund.","Repurchased 110 million common shares for $2.7 billion, which includes 1.1 billion repurchase with the accelerated stock repurchase plan, pay $442 million in dividends and invest $3 billion in capital. At the end of the first quarter we had approximately $546 million remaining under the March share repurchase authorization. Purchases under the ASR will be completed no later than July 6th.","We\u2019re investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next three years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. We have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and a compensation package to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.","Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to guidance for 2018, we expect identical sales growth excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. This reflects our updated definition of identical sales and is supported by an expectation for identical supermarket sales that is the same as our original guidance for the year. To be clear if we hadn't updated the ID sales definition we would've confirmed our original guidance for the year this morning.","We have raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $3.64 to $3.79 per diluted share for 2018. The previous GAAP range was 3.59 to 3.79. On an adjusted basis, we raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $2 to $2.15 per diluted share compared to a $2.95 to 2.15 previously. We feel very good about the year. We plan for the first quarter to be our strongest EPS quarter, which creates a tailwind for the investments we plan the rest of the year.","Our first quarter was a $0.10 outperformance over the consensus forecast, and as I said earlier, was also a little better than our internal expectations. Looking at the consensus forecast for the remainder of the year, we believe the second and fourth quarters are a little high compared to our own expectations and the third quarter looks reasonable.","I am taking the unusual step of commenting on this, because if you simply add the $0.10 to your forecast for the year that would put the consensus above the high side of our guidance range. We are off to a great start to 2018 and are on pace to deliver our $2 to $2.15 net earnings per diluted share guidance range for the year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2018.","And finally, we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%. And now, I'll turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks Mike. When we announced Restock Kroger, we talked about retailers needing to constantly reinvent themselves. It takes time to do this we're now past the halfway point and everything we are doing today is transforming our business for renewed growth. For 2018, we are a little ahead of where we thought we'd be. We're hitting our cost control targets due to process change, improving the associate experience and innovating to create the future of retail.","That innovation is both internal and external. We are joining up with external partners like Ocado and Home Chef to create customer value while quickly expanding our seamless coverage area. We remain confident in our ability to deliver both on our plan for the year and to execute Restock Kroger over the next three years, which will create shareholder value.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Michael Lasser","Two questions, one, why is buy versus build the right decision for some of the recent actions you've taken, particularly in the home delivery market that is increasingly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry? And then I had a second question on the guidance.","Mike Schlotman","I am not sure what you mean by buy versus build on the home delivery. We really haven't -- obviously with Home Chef and the meal kits, we do anticipate merging with them and they have a great process and a great home delivery business of those meal kits. But as Rodney said, they're also going to take over managing the in-store portion of that business as well, so they'll get inside not just a home delivery but also delivering meals to those customers in the brick-and-mortar environment as well.","On other aspects of home delivery, we're actually creating partnerships whether it\u2019s with Instacart as we do today in areas or as we further our relationship with Ocado and start building the sheds here in the U.S. and have that be an avenue for home delivery as well. We think some of these partnerships and the phenomenal technology and proprietary information and processes that Ocado has will accelerate our abilities to do those in the U.S.","Rodney McMullen","Just one additional thing to Mike's comment, I mean we're really looking at what's the blend of both and which one accelerates for us to be able to get a complete as fast as possible in an efficient way of making sure that we maintain and grow in the relationship with the customer. So, it\u2019s really looking at partnership and some things we continue to build on our own if you look at our own ClickList business we're growing on our own, so it's really a blend of both.","Michael Lasser","That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the guidance. Can you give us a little bit more insight into some of the moving pieces? Have you changed what's embedded for operating profit dollars for this year, particularly after it sounds like you're seeing more success with some of the process improvement and process changes that are resulting in SG&A dollar savings even there is -- it's hard for us to tell given what's been provided?","Mike Schlotman","That I would say, we haven't changed our view of where operating profit dollars would trend for the year being consistent view that we would expect overall for 2018 to be a bit of an investment year. Obviously, our share count a lot lower which will help earnings per share calculation. We are off to a great start for the year. I think, we purposely if you look at how we set this year up.","We purposely make sure we had some other savings in the bank from the process changes. We began the pull forward of investments in the business in the last several weeks of the quarter. So, you didn't see a lot of the effect from the investments we\u2019re going to making in price and other service elements in the store until very late quarter. Those will start to happen in the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year as well.","Operator","The next question will come from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","I want to first just ask about the comps and the outlook. Could you talk about the cadence of the ID\u2019s throughout the quarter and what you\u2019re seeing so far in Q2? And just as we think about the full year obviously you maintained your ID guidance. It does look like this is going to be less inflation probably than maybe we would have thought about a quarter ago. So I guess it suggests that your outlook on tonnage is probably bit better than what it's been, and clearly just to get to that number right you need an improvement from here. So in addition, thoughts on all that would be helpful.","Mike Schlotman","Sure, Ed. If you look at IDs obviously we're just barely below the guidance range even through old definition and new definition really 10 basis point short of being inside our guidance range for the year. So it's not a huge hill to climb to be inside the guidance range for the year. There are a lot of moving parts to ID sales out there, I would agree with you on inflation. There certainly isn't as much inflation, there is between 1% and 2% inflation in pharmacy the rest of the business would probably be 1\/2% to a little less than half percent and in some categories it's actually deflationary, but it's a little bit all over the board.","When you think about as we continue to execute our space optimization strategy that certainly creates a headwind today. We think that headwind will continue to mitigate throughout the second quarter little bit of the lesson will continue to be a headwind. And by the time we get the late third quarter, we would expect that the terms to be a tailwind which we think will help offset some of the headwind we create on our own on the retail cost deflation by the investments and prices were making.","I would say our expectations for ID sales this year were not really predicated on an inflation driven result. It was based on a unit driven result just when you think about the fact we knew we were going to be creating headwinds early in the year with space optimization. And now that we've done the first lot of the pull forward investments we plan to make at the end of this quarter that will create some a bit of a headwind in the near-term as well.","And answer your question about where we are so far in the quarter, I think our expectations from the quarter would be that we would expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of where in this years in the first quarter, we would expect the second quarter to be comparable to that. We\u2019re slightly below it but to keep in mind, we were probably at the peak of the headwind for space optimization today and will write in the biggest portion of haven't made all the pull forward price investments we made in the last four weeks of the quarter, although the conversion right now.","We continue to be very happy with the unit growth we see and the response from our customers of what we see in reaction to the price investment, a lot of those in our brands and you heard Rodney talk about our brand, unit growth in the first quarter of over 5%, which is it\u2019s not only phenomenal product, it\u2019s a phenomenal result and even more value for our customers.","Edward Kelly","And just another question for you is on labor and labor negotiations and structuring the contracts. Obviously, it does seem like you're approaching negotiations a little bit differently and trying to structure contracts that provide you with more flexibility within the store, particularly around sort of like who can do what, right. Can you just give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re looking to accomplish there? And as we think about the structure of those changes, how does that play into your ability to drive labor cost savings in the stores going forward?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at overall, in terms of the approach, it\u2019s really contemporizing the way our associates are paid. And understanding, we have five generations in the workforce and having a pay design that connects with each one of those five generations. So, a big part of every negotiation is understanding, the balance between healthcare and pension. We still have as Mike mentioned one of the most generous healthcare and pension benefits in the industry. Some of our younger associates, that's not as important in making sure that we balance plan designs with wages.","As you know, we've increased starting wages and a lot of the acceleration that\u2019s part of Restock Kroger was acceleration of starting wages. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing improvements in retention. The -- in terms of the ability, you\u2019re always working on process changes to improve how the workflows and use direct -- reduce labor, so that our -- we can reinvest that labor in better service, so if you think about today we\u2019re investing labor and ClickList, we\u2019re investing labor in some of the service department. And what we\u2019re able to do is, as our business continues to grow, it also creates more demand on people.","I don\u2019t know Mike anything you want to add to that.","Mike Schlotman","No, I absolutely agree, and one of the exciting things we\u2019re seeing is we\u2019re starting to see the green shoots of the investments and the opening wage rates for our associates and our ability to retain that associate for longer period of time. If we can keep that associate for a full year, we\u2019re actually on the positive side of the investment, because we haven\u2019t invested -- we haven\u2019t had the hire and train and get a new associate up to speed and that cost is actually more than the $1 an hour wage investment for 2,000 in ADRs worked in the year. So, it winds up being very positive for our associates. They can -- they get more pay and it winds being positive for our customers because you have a more experienced and recognizable workforce as well.","Rodney McMullen","And you hear us talk about a lot about opportunity culture and what we find is, when people love people and love working with people and they love food, we\u2019re beautiful place to come and people come here for a job. But as they spent time around people and the fast growing and the ability to understand how they impact people's lives every single day, they fall in love with it, next when it becomes a career. And the nice thing about us is many of people -- over 70% of our store managers, started out as hourly associate. So it\u2019s a great place to come for a job and then make it a career.","Edward Kelly","I guess what I was trying to get at, I think part of the reason that your cost structure is higher is because there are different work rules in the stores relative to some of your non-unionized peers. And those things that you're able to address through restructuring of labor contracts, I think more recently maybe you had done that on one of the contracts that you talked about.","Mike Schlotman","It's certainly a component in every negotiation we have of getting wall-to-wall clerk status in those contracts. So whatever task needs to be completed next, we can manage a workforce that can do all the tasks inside of the store rather than need to have three or four different employees all ready to do the next task in each individual department. That was clearly a component of the Cincinnati negotiation that we completed most recently.","And it's not like flipping the switch for Cincinnati where they immediately understand how to manage the work schedule with a clerk like that after many years of not having that type of a clerk. So those savings continue to grow in the Cincinnati market. But we strive to get that more and more, it's an important component of -- when we have to hire, we have to have fewer people, because I can have one person work 15 or 16 hours a week instead of four people working a few hours in every department.","Operator","The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays.","Karen Short","So I just want to make sure I'm understanding this. So Mike based on your comments on consensus EPS for 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, it implies operating profit swing from being slightly up in 1Q to being down somewhere in the 20% range 2Q to 4Q. First of all, is that --- that's fair, right?","Mike Schlotman","I don't have that exact math right in front of me. We've been very outspoken about the fact that we expect operating profit dollars to be -- FIFO operating profit dollars to be down this year as compared to last year. That would continue to be our expectation. And as I said earlier in the prepared comments, we continue to make the investments in the business, and maybe came later in the year as well.","Karen Short","And the reason that the swing is so extreme from 1Q into 2Q is as you said, the remodels ramp and price investments ramp pretty meaningfully?","Mike Schlotman","Well, we made a lot of the pull forward price investments we made in the last four weeks of the quarter. We wanted to make sure we had that tailwind and knew that we were going to get the cost savings before we made investments and just hope about it. One other thing I would remind you about the year-on-year comparison is last year had 53 weeks and this year has 52 weeks. So you have to adjust for that as well.","Karen Short","And so just switching gears, I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on how many units you\u2019ve actually or maybe you will have completed on the Restock program by the end of maybe 2Q. And then if there's any early indication you could give us on how you think comps of those stores are performing. And maybe separate out how comps in stores that didn't have optimization are performing versus the ones that did.","Mike Schlotman","Well, I guess I could give you comp by store too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're about 30% of the way through the 600, so that would mean we\u2019ve got about 200 or so of the stores completed. That doesn't mean that they've gone through the maturation process that it takes a few weeks after the completion for the customer to come back in the store, get familiar with the new layout of the store, make sure -- there are instances where our customer is looking for something and in the near term throws up the white flag until they figure out exactly where everything is located in the new layout.","Now we staff up and have maps and things like that but that takes a while. As I said earlier, we expect over the course of the next couple of periods that the peak amount of the headwind from the space optimization will be occurring. And by the time we get late in the third quarter, we will clearly have more stores completed going through on the upside on the maturation process than stores we have left to start or that are still in process. It\u2019s a little early at this point in time to talk about the stores and the lift we\u2019re having.","We actually had that conversation yesterday in our meeting, and we would think -- we think that\u2019s probably something will address in the second quarter. What I would tell you is what we're seeing so far is exactly the pattern that we would expect it and that we saw on the 20 or so stores we did early in this process to determine it was something worth doing on a broader basis. So we haven't seen any surprises whatsoever.","Karen Short","And then just last question. Has there been any contemplation that maybe you could accelerate opening the Ocado facilities. I mean, I know you\u2019ve given us the timeline and you\u2019re still evaluating the market. But it would seem that maybe an acceleration would be -- something that would be viewed favorably.","Rodney McMullen","Well, we\u2019re going to open the facilities as fast as we can. Obviously, there's a certain amount of time that takes to construct a facility and then for Ocado to build it out. So there is plenty of pressure on Ocado and us to get them open as quickly as we can. But there is obviously a certain amount of time in terms of what it takes to actually get the work done.","Rodney McMullen","I just want to point out one thing on your question on operating profit. I would encourage you to look at the tables attached to the press release to understand the adjustment items that are in their, because I think when you pull out the sea stores, when you pull out -- we had a mark to market gain on the Ocado shares we owned before the announcement of the merger that was like $36 million, which is on Table 6 of the earnings release.","I think when you look at operating profit margin dollars apples-to-apples, the dollars were actually down slightly in the quarter as compared to last year not up, which is exactly the trend we expect. But again it goes -- it's all about balance and trying to keep things within the range we have. There were several things that happened in the first quarter that were income that we took out of adjustment items when you look at, I think it's Table 6 in the press release. That will an important table for everybody to look at.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","I just wanted to first clarify. What is outside ID sales now? Is it just new stores, remodels and jewelry, or am I missing something?","Rodney McMullen","Net new stores would not be in, relocations with not be in. Well the stores don\u2019t go in until they\u2019re open in your current state for five full quarters, so expand, relocate or open a new store it\u2019s the fifth quarter where they go in. There are other parts of our businesses that generate revenue and things like 8451 in our data sales, and those items that we don't include in ID sales. What is in ID sales or things we sell directly to a customer, whether it's through a brick-and-mortar store or an online business, that is what's in ID sales today going forward.","Mike Schlotman","Some of our competitors would include expansions, but we do not include expansions in our calculation. We didn\u2019t before and we still don't, Tim.","Ken Goldman","I also wanted to ask a little bit about Rodney\u2019s comment about over time reaching all of America. And given that the Northeast has such a dense population and given that you don\u2019t really have a presence there. Is that Rodney about how you view the potential of Ocado, going forward? I just wanted to get a sense of what that comment meant, or maybe I misheard it and just wanted some clarification there if I could?","Rodney McMullen","No, you did not mishear it and that is our vision and our aspiration. And obviously, that will be one piece of the puzzle on serving that home chef will also be one piece of serving. And our customers tell us, we do a great job of helping them solve everyday needs in a great way. In any way that we can expand the number of people that can get access to that, that's good for our customers, it\u2019s good for our associates and when we do things good for that our shareholders benefit. So you did not misinterpret my comment.","Ken Goldman","One last one if I could just sneak one in, thank you for that is on your corporate brands, your own brands. Do you think -- you talked them up a little bit more than usual, I think. At least the tone seemed to be that way to me. How much of that was due to some of the changes you\u2019ve made in Restock Kroger in terms of prioritizing private label in certain categories, putting them at the top right in the middle of the shelf? So I just wanted to get an idea of whether there\u2019s a correlation there in your mind?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, let me give you a little bit more answer Kent than you probably even want. But one of the things last year that our team did was a very elaborate analysis of our brands versus our competitors\u2019, their own brands and we also did taste comparisons and quality comparisons versus national brand. And one of the things that we had underappreciated was the quality of our product stored incredibly well with our customers and potential customers.","So one of the things that Mike and Robert and their teams and Gill, their teams decided to do was based on that insight is to be much more aggressive about telling our customers the quality of what we have and what we have to offer. So really that\u2019s what caused us to make our own brand such a key and integral part of Restock Kroger, it\u2019s that commitment and drive that our customers are supporting us and it\u2019s showing in the result.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So I know it\u2019s early, but two questions on Ocado. It obviously can do a lot of things for you. But when you think about the ability to do ClickList in a more labor efficient manner, maybe be less disruptive to the stores. So how important is that on the pecking order? And then if it is important just the transition, how would you transition that? And then secondly, when you do Ocado in a market when you don't have brick-and-mortar, is it important -- could you -- would you want to have some brick-and-mortar and does that open the door to partnering with other retailers, or is that just too difficult to do?","Rodney McMullen","I love your questions, and I agree with your comment that it\u2019s early in the process. What we're really trying to do is to make sure that we have an overall infrastructure for digital that can support, whether it's 5% of share or 30% of share. If it ends up being 30% of share in grocery as digital then the Ocado, you'll have more sheds and they'll be used to take pressure off of the store, and the store will become more of a distribution point.","So what we're really trying to design is flexibility of a system that can scale based on how the customer changes. We would expect that Ocado would be something that we will pick orders out for stores as the orders in the store becomes high enough percentage that affects the customers\u2019 experience.","John Heinbockel","Today, there's no -- because the volume is so modest, there's no evidence that doing ClickList adversely impacts the in store experience. Correct?","Rodney McMullen","Yes, so far it doesn\u2019t. But the thing that we don't know, if you look at our sales growth on ClickList or digital overall was in the high 60s, and some of that growth is driven by identical and we're starting to get a pretty good base of identical stores that are on ClickList. If it continues to grow at its pace, we certainly see when you go out a couple of years where it could, and we want to be proactive on be in position to deal with it versus reactive to dealing with it\u2026","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, the price investments you're making this year compared to prior rounds. What does the elasticity look like? So I imagine there's -- we're getting -- you did the high-volume items first, we're getting to a longer tail. Is the elasticity less significant than prior rounds?","Rodney McMullen","I guess I would -- elasticity is consistent with what we expected it would be. There are certain categories where there is very little elasticity there is others that would have elasticity. So, so far the investments have been consistent with what we would have expected. And you're always balancing a mix between those different items.","Operator","And the next question comes from William Kirk of RBC Capital Markets.","William Kirk","So we've seen some high profile closures at some of your competitors. I guess, the first part of that is, have you seen a material benefit from any of those closures. And second do you expect more closures to come, and in particular, I am thinking the California market. Is there any pending closures that you'd expect in that marketplace?","Rodney McMullen","Well, you can certainly never predict when a competitor is going to wind up closing. And if you look around some of our markets where they've been closures, we've been the beneficiary in a few ways; one, from picking up the business; two, from picking up some of their closed store sites like we did in Indianapolis when Marsh closed and Farm Fresh has exited the Hampton Rose area. We picked up some of those stores and some other folks have as well.","You continue to see those things happening as well. Southeastern Grocers as they emerge from bankruptcy were not obviously very affected by the stores in Florida they closed. But as they repositioned their portfolio of Bi-Lo stores there're certainly a number of those that would've gone up against either a Kroger store or a Harris Teeter store. So those wind up being beneficial. We didn't really pick up much of anything from there. There was only one or two stores that had any interest. And I frankly don't even know if they came to fruition as I sit here right now.","But anytime a store closes in a market it winds up helping. Sometimes our folks say what they\u2019re only doing next volume in the business, and I\u2019d say well if you get half of that to buy the sales in the near store, you\u2019re talking 3% to 4% ID for that store. So it can be beneficial when those come in on top, because those incremental sales are very valuable.","Mike Schlotman","And broader over time, this isn\u2019t specific to any market. We would expect continued consolidation in our industry and that\u2019s been a trend that\u2019s happened for the last 20-30 years. And I am trying to remember, Mike may have mentioned at this morning on one of the interviews. If you look at competitors in terms of who has market share, almost 30% of the market share is still held by people without our economies scale.","Rodney McMullen","And then separately on the convenience stores, now that that transaction is closed, are there any other assets that would be worth considering divestiture, or is that the streamlining that needs to be done at this time?","Rodney McMullen","We\u2019re constantly looking at our portfolio as we constantly look at closing underperforming stores and reallocating capital. I wouldn't say that specifically want to sell anything or buy anything, but we were cognizant of what might be more valuable to someone else versus us that's really what happened with the convenience store business. It\u2019s a business we have invested a lot of capital in and multiples of EBITDA for the sales of those are pretty much at all-time highs. And it was a prudent time to have that asset and we found a great partner in EG who wound up taking all of our associates. And it\u2019s a process we go through with our board on a regular basis. So they understand which assets that we have or generating a good return on invested capital and which aren\u2019t.","Operator","And the next question comes from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse.","Judah Frommer","So first maybe just on the competitive and pricing environment, and this is somewhat tied to inflation. But if we look into commentary out of what I would call some smaller players, it sounds like they are seeing some passing on or whatever little inflation there it is to shelf pricing. But that seems less and less important for players like yourselves or larger competitors that are more focused on targeted promotion. So what are you seeing out there and how important is it to continue to invest in pricing environment where maybe some other players are pulling back there.","Rodney McMullen","Well, in our mind as you know, a big portion and a fundamental piece of Restock Kroger is to continue to invest in our business and that take several forms. It's when we say investment in business, everybody mainly goes to price. Price is an important component of it. We are making investments and price in certain categories. I would say we\u2019re not opposed to a retail shelf price going up. And sometimes we have to be cognizant as the dominant player in many markets.","If there's price inflation in a particular category, if the big players don\u2019t pass on that inflation, it\u2019s probably not going to get passed on. So we do make those value judgments day-in and day-out as we look into particular categories where the inflation might be. This is a game of what's -- how do we make sure that our offering resonates with the consumers and we try to balance all facets of that.","Judah Frommer","And then maybe switching gears back to Ocado. If we think about ClickList and home delivery being the key components of online grocery now, and what Ocado has been doing in their home market in terms of better profitability on basket given just fewer picking touches and efficiencies like that. How do you think about the potential for your online grocery business profitability over time as Ocado comes in?","Rodney McMullen","We would certainly view that it\u2019s part of the overall equation and improving the profitability over time. But we\u2019re -- as you\u2019ve heard us talk about before, what we\u2019re really focused on is when somebody decides to eat something they can get it from us. And we\u2019re increasingly adding delivery service to markets. We\u2019re using our data that help inspire people on what meal that they will enjoy. So it\u2019s part of that overall ecosystem as we create the retail of the future. So it\u2019s an important component of that, but it\u2019s one piece of the total puzzle.","Operator","And the next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","So I wanted to touch on your commentary just about better cost controls during the quarter. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what\u2019s driving those improvements and the process changes, and the benefits on your cost line?","Rodney McMullen","Well, as I mentioned in prepared comments, our strength, folks add, great results in the quarter and continue to get a better result on our waste. And they're looking at it -- really, they don't use the word strength, we use the word strength, because that\u2019s what resonates with all of you. Internally; we talk about waste and they're trying to understand every facet of waste, whether it's not having the product aligned in the back the right way to get on the sales floor before it goes out of code; making sure that back doors are locked, so product only comes in the back door, not out the back door; making sure that the high theft areas of our store are monitored generally electronically; you can go in the stores today and you\u2019ll see visible cameras in high theft areas, like in cosmetics.","They probably saw me this weekend when I waved to one of the cameras when I was in my local Kroger store, they probably wondering that -- now they\u2019re probably going to watch me in every store I go into, but those techniques are out there to prevent the waste. And when you have those kinds of techniques in there, people are less likely to even try. And when they do try and they get caught, that does spread through that community and they stop trying with you. But it goes across the broad spectrum of monitors on cooler doors not being shut in the store. And if it\u2019s open for x seconds, not only there is wasted energy it lets hot air in and the product quality can be diminished.","What was our temperature monitoring process that we actually originally put in as a labor savings initiative in the store. So we didn't have to go about the store and starting to talk like the Brits go about the store, spending a lot of time with Ocado. But go about the store and take temperatures throughout and what you really find is it winds being quite a bit of the waste reduction benefit in keeping the cold chain secure. I\u2019d like to say it used to be -- you didn\u2019t know a ice cream freezer was losing temperature and until you saw the ice cream melt.","Now, we get an alert that that motor and that ice cream case is being inefficient. You can get the product out, get the motor fixed probably get it fixed with a repair instead of a replacement like what we used to have to do in the past, so there's a whole lot of things like that. I highlight waste today, because they\u2019re working really hard and having really great results. And I want to have a little bit of a shout out to that team and thank you for all the hard work they've done, it's starting to show in the results.","Operator","And that final question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","So wanted to go back, obviously, it's still early, but digital clearly increasing in focus. just wondering with maybe some of 8451 data that you guys have and some of the areas where it's a bit longer. Can you give us any further color on what you are seeing from a customer perspective? So meaning in the stores where some forms of it have been available for a while. How's the progression changing? What's in the basket, ticket frequency, to the store? And maybe also just as you're looking at these first three Ocado facilities, anything at this point that you can provide in terms of thoughts around how much of the geographies or stores that may encompass.","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look at digital, I think the key point and this is the part that hasn't surprised us at all. When a customer engages with us digitally, we get a higher share of their total household spend. And what we find is the customer still comes into the store, but they come in to it based on when they want to. Or an example I always think of is, if you\u2019ve got a couple of kids at home and they bring their friends over, you probably didn't buy food for their friends and somebody will stop by or get a delivery to their house really quick.","So what we find is the more digitally engaged somebody is the higher their total household spend is. It's not necessarily consistent from week-to-week in terms of your share of how much of its digital and how much of it is physical in the store, the thing that's absolutely critical is to do it in a seamless way. And do it seamlessly from food inspiration or help you eat healthier. We just launched an app called OptUP, and we're able to -- if a customer opts in, we can help a customer eat better on a sugar basis, over time we'll have more functionality. But today it's more minimizing and managing your sugar intake. But all of those things is how do we make your life easier and how do you live your life -- how do we help support you living your life the way you want to. So everything that we're doing -- what we're trying to do is to make sure it\u2019s seamless across all our channels. So that's really the piece that we're working hard on.","On your second question on Ocado, that's one of the things that the Ocado team is actually working with us and modeling, is to understand how far can a shed reach in a market. And as you know, with Ocado, they also have local depots as well that will be part of a shed network. And right now, they are actually modeling, answering your question -- your question is a great one but we are in the middle of modeling that. And so at some point, we'll be able to answer it with more specifics. But at this point, we're still working on that.","Vincent Sinisi","And if I could just fit one more fast one in here if you don't mind, because we get asked about this all the time. I think it's been now two quarters since you had mentioned within some of the gross margin benefit about vendor negotiations. Any updates there, how are some of those conversations going? And maybe just, even as go through the year, I think 3Q just from a compares is the most difficult, so any updates there that you could share -- or just basic thoughts that would be great? Thanks guys. ","Rodney McMullen","So our team that negotiates the cost of goods with our vendors continue to have great success using a variety of techniques depending on the category. And keep in mind everything we do on our negotiation process begins with the customer in the forefront and understanding by category what items are important to the customer, what items might be less important to the customer. And that begins the entire negotiation process, and often times playing one vendor off of another when the customer might be indifferent to it.","I would say it's right on track with our expectation and is a big component of our expected savings over the next three years. And I\u2019m thrilled with what that entire team has done and we brought some new talent into that group, and we\u2019re really thrilled with how that group has hit the ground running on, not only cost of goods savings or goods for sale, but also goods not for resale, so supplies and the like and other items that we consume ourselves and doing business every day.","Vincent Sinisi","Perfect, good luck guys, thanks.","Rodney McMullen","We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our Associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business and of course, many of our associates, our shareholders as well. So before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them.","We are very proud of Kroger's opportunity culture where you can come for a job and stay for a career. And as you know, we took one third of our tax savings to invest in new and enhanced benefits for our associates. We use part of that investment to establish our best in class educational offering, feed your future. I\u2019m thrilled to see so many of you already taking advantage of these new benefits.","Let me tell you a story about one of the first associates to take advantage of Feed Your Future. Lindsey is a pharmacy technician in our Louisville division. She was working her way through college, accumulating student loans and had planned to stop working to focus on school full-time. But after an assistant store manager told her about Feed Your Future, Lindsay decided to stay with Kroger while she finishes her bachelor's degree. And now Lindsay\u2019s goal is to pursue a graduate degree with dreams of becoming a physician's assistant for Little Clinic business. Lindsay\u2019s story is exactly what we hoped would happen when we introduced Feed Your Future. We believe that when we support our associates and each other and our customers, business and shareholders will benefit. Thank you for all you do for each other and everybody every day. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Details will be coming soon and we hope you can join us.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And the next time you see Mike, please congratulate him on his well-deserved and well-earned promotion.","We are pleased with our second quarter results. Our 5.3% identical supermarket sales growth without fuel allowed us to continue investing in our business and delivering on our aggressive growth plan. Strong fuel margins toward the end of the quarter allowed us to deliver results that exceeded our original expectations. During the second quarter we achieved our 47th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling four-quarter basis.","We kept costs down, which together with identical supermarket sales growth, allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses at a rate of sales and we continued to grow market share by improving our connection with customers, which fueled both our top and bottom lines, and enables strategic Customer 1st investment. These consistently remarkable financial results are possible quarter after quarter because our business is built on the belief that serving customers is serving shareholders.","Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share and identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. While customers continue to feel optimistic about the economy throughout the second quarter, they also continue to tell us they want to spend less. More and more, they want retailers to help them save money with sales and coupons. We are well positioned with our everyday low prices and our weekly sales and digital offers to solve this for our customers.","As you know, the food retail business is in a constant state of change. Part of what makes our Customer 1st strategy is so powerful is it provides Kroger a firm foundation from which to approach new opportunities in the right way to benefit our customers, associates and shareholders. While there are many examples for our businesses is rapidly involving I'd like to highlight three key areas of innovation and investment today: Technology, food and people. And how the steps we are taking in each of these areas are broadening our competitive advantage for the future.","We are actively expanding our use of technology in ways we believe will make a difference for customers and associates. This summer we expanded our online ordering pilot in Cincinnati to three additional divisions. We are now offering our order online, pickup at the store solution in select Kroger stores in Louisville and Indianapolis and Fred Meyer stores in the Portland area. This is, of course, in addition to the Harris Teeter's successful express lane service.","When you think about digital opportunities, we do not limit our focus to e-commerce. Digital for Kroger includes a broad range of efforts to interact with customers in increasingly relevant and meaningful ways whether online or through our mobile app. A key metric is our measure of digital and household engagement. And during the second quarter, we continued to gain household engagement at record numbers.","Our Kroger technology team continues to earn recognition for leading edge initiatives to establish the Internet of Things in our stores. Earlier this summer, Kroger's electronic temperature monitoring project was named a winner of the CIO 100 Award by CIO Magazine. And as we shared with you in June, the talented team at 84.51 is helping us grow and evolve even faster due to their closer daily involvement in our business. 84.51's specialty, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly put the customer first is a significant competitive advantage for Kroger.","Our multi-tiered Corporate Brands portfolio has always been a powerful differentiator for Kroger. Simple Truth continues to see explosive growth. Private selection remains a vibrant billion dollar brand that is growing in the double digits and developing unique offerings in many categories. I'm pleased to share with you that later this month we will launch an entirely new brand called HEMISFARES. HEMISFARES brings only the best food finds from around the globe to our food curious customers for an amazing authentic eating experience. It's a guide tour of the best tastes on the earth.","Imagine landing in a country known for its incredible food and experiencing the finest examples of its region's most famous and delectable eats. Every HEMISFARES product is curated from the source and imported directly to our stores. The most exciting part is that no one else has a brand like this. HEMISFARES is a great example of what makes our Corporate Brands unique and we think will appeal to millennials, foodies and ultimately all cuts of our customers. And by the way I've tried a lot of the products and its outstanding. It's not just great and I think you're going to love it when you get a chance to try it.","Our reputation for consistently \u2013 consistent execution rests squarely on the shoulders of our 400,000 associates who make it all happen in our stores, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, and offices. Our work force is expanding rapidly to support our growth strategy. Last year, we created 25,000 new jobs and right now we are hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 new and permanent positions in our stores. We are looking for people who want to be part of a team, take pride in everything they do and want to grow with us.","One important and untapped resource for new associates is our country's military veterans. Since 2009, more than 29,000 veterans have joined our ranks, and hundreds of current associates continue to actively serve in the military. Over the past several years Kroger has formalized our military hiring initiatives. We joined the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies with the common goal of hiring transitioning service members and military veterans, and we have increased our presence at military recruiting events.","Next week we are hosting our first ever Honoring Our Heroes hiring event during which we will hold open interviews at every one of our supermarket locations on Tuesday, September 15 for all veterans and their family members. The fact that nearly 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates or stocking shelves or bagging groceries speaks to Kroger's opportunity culture, which we believe is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be so in the future.","Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to comment on our announcement yesterday of a new organizational structure for our senior leadership team. We take a team approach to leadership and this new structure is designed to better align resources to our company's goals. It also streamlines decision-making and accelerates progress on our growth strategy. As I said in our announcement yesterday, Kroger is incredibly fortunate to have such an exceptional strong group of leaders across our company, and our senior leadership team has unmatched depth and experience to continue delivering for our customers, associates and shareholders.","Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter results, provide you an update on labor relations and update our guidance for 2015. Mike?","Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.","Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Our identical supermarket sales growth of 5.3% in the second quarter demonstrates the strength of our core business. Our identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of strong tonnage growth and an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the second quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at an even faster rate than total household growth during the quarter.","All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel during the quarter. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli, and pharmacy departments also posted strong sales.","Rolling four-quarters FIFO operating margin excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 \u2013 I hope you got all that \u2013 increased by 20 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on the rolling four quarters basis.","Return on invested capital on a rolling four quarters basis was 14.24%. We're now presenting a comparative number this quarter because the last year's second quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect our return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from fiscal 2014 results. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.","Before I share our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current operating environment which has more volatility than normal, especially as it relates to fuel margins and inflation. We benefited from higher fuel margins late in the second quarter. As Rodney said, our nonfuel results were right in line with where we expected them to be. We expect fuel volatility to continue for the remainder of the year.","Another factor that we are actively managing is product costs. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the second quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.4% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. Seafood and milk were deflationary. Produce prices were less deflationary in the quarter and we continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals. It bears repeating and if you look back over the past several years, we have had periods of high and low inflation and we've shown that regardless of the environment we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers.","Now I'll share our second quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable impact that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the second quarter were impacted by the lower retail price of fuel, much like the first quarter. The average price of retail fuel during our second quarter was $2.67 compared to $3.54 last year. Total sales in the second quarter increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion compared to $25.3 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased to 5.7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year. In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $433 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $347 million or $0.35 per diluted share.","Kroger reported a $21 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $26 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin excluding retail fuel operations decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year. Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the second quarter. Total operating expenses excluding retail fuel operations decreased 35 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Second quarter FIFO operating profit excluding fuel increased approximately $93 million over the prior year.","Now for retail fuel operations. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.19 compared to $0.183 in the same quarter last year. We expect fuel margins to continue to be volatile during the second half of the year. Kroger brand's performance during the second quarter was solid, representing approximately 26.4% of total units sold and 25.1% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in Columbus and Memphis and have ratified all of the local agreements associated with the master agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW store associates in Denver and Portland and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable healthcare and a retirement benefit for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be don't be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitability, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to repurchase shares, give an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1 billion to shareholders through buy-backs and dividends over the last four quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.1 million common shares for a total investment of $43 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers and acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $812 million for the second quarter compared to $672 million for the same period last year.","We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, to be at the high end of the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. We're turning towards the high end because we see a strong pipeline of high quality projects and we continue to be encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects.","The company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.02 compared to 2.32 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.1 billion during the same period last year. Again this year, or again this quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters, investing $3.1 billion in capital on a rolling four-quarter's basis, plus an additional $426 million on mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and shareholders while delivering value to our customers and increasing opportunities for our associates.","Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance excluding fuel to a range of 4% to 5% for 2015. The prior guidance was 3.5% to 4.5%. We also raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $1.92 to $1.98 for fiscal 2015. The previous guidance was $1.90 to $1.95 per diluted share. This range exceeds the company's net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We continue to expect the third quarter to be at the high end of our long-term growth range and the fourth quarter to be below the range. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our base business is performing very well. The volatility of fuel in the back half of the year will determine where we end up within that range.","Now I'll return it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike. Kroger's business is strong. Our team of associates continues to derive our Customer 1st strategy by taking care of our customers in big and small ways, offering fresh foods and keeping costs down so that we can reinvest those savings in our associates, store experience, products and prices. As a result, we continue to earn customer loyalty and gain market share. We are investing to grow our business for the future while delivering on our promises today. Our stores are hiring to fill 20,000 new permanent jobs. We are expanding our digital and e-commerce offerings. Our confidence in Kroger has never been stronger.","Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short","Hi. Congratulations on a great quarter.","Michael Schlotman","Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Karen Short","Good morning. I don't want to sound negative here but I guess what I'm wondering in terms of your ID guidance for the year, it definitely reflects a slowdown in the two-year comp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, even though it looks like inflation is maybe getting a little bit better, maybe less of a headwind. So I guess any color there? Are you of being conservative? Any color you could give would be helpful.","Rodney McMullen","The guidance is always one of the hardest things to come up with what's the right estimate. As you know, we've always expected inflation to continue to slow down during the year and we would expect that to continue. Now, we're working hard, as always, to make sure that we're at the good side of that. If you look at where we are so far this quarter, we continue to track within the guidance and kind of similar to where we were in the second quarter. So we feel good about where we are. And we see exciting opportunity. I don't know, Mike, did you want to?","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, Karen, another thing to keep in mind is if you look at real growth, if you look at our current ID sales trend and even what we would be projecting and take away the relatively benign inflationary environment today, it's actually as strong a real growth as we've had in quite some time, really going all the way back to three or four years, actually four or five years. You really don't see a trend as strong as we have today when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis. Our tonnage growth is quite strong. And from our standpoint, as long as we continue to have the tonnage growth in many of the departments that we have, we'll be just fine because that's the ultimate demonstration of the strength of your businesses is how many items are the customers buying on a weekly and monthly basis.","Karen Short","Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess also, just on your guidance. I just was wondering on your updated pension guidance, you have some changes in both the company and the multi-employer. It's unclear to me on the multi-employer if your prior guidance just didn't include the $16 million that was previously accrued, but you definitely also increased the company-sponsored, so obviously, you're raising your guidance, even with those two headwinds?","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, the $16 million would have been accrued and expensed when it was accrued. Keep in mind, on the multi-employer plans, when you have a contractual obligation or actually put dollars in, you expense it versus the company plan, we could put money in and it may not translate into a current expense. So they're quite different in how you account for the two calculations. I don't \u2013 it's not a dramatic change in our expectations between the two plans, although somewhat.","Karen Short","More of a headwind. Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks very much.","Michael Schlotman","It would be \u2013 I mean, it would be a slight headwind compared to where we were earlier in the year, but nothing dramatic.","Karen Short","Right. Okay. Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh","Good morning, and congrats on a really nice quarter.","Michael Schlotman","Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Rupesh Parikh","I want to just touch on your pharmacy business. We've seen some of your competitors call out some headwinds within their pharmacy business on the margin line. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys are also seeing some headwinds within your pharmacy business as well on the margin line.","Rodney McMullen","As you know, one of the things that's so important for us is our total portfolio of businesses. And when you look, there's almost every year you'll have something stronger and something else weaker. And if you look at the pharmacy business, what we would be experiencing would be pretty similar to what some of our competitors would talk about. We continue to have very strong growth on the number of scripts filled, and that has been true for a long period of time and our pharmacy teams continue to do a great job on taking care of our customers. But in terms of financial, it would be very similar to what some of the others have talked about. But it is \u2013 the nice thing and the great thing about having a portfolio of businesses where some pieces are obviously growing well in excess of the total.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay. Great. And then switching topics to maybe expenses, the leverage this quarter is much better than what we saw last quarter. Besides sales leverage, was there anything else that may have contributed to the better leverage this period?","Michael Schlotman","No, I think it's really across-the-board, good cost controls in many facets of the business. As we often say here at Kroger, sales are a beautiful thing, and when you can have north of 5% IDs, the sales leverage on the expense line becomes quite enormous, and particularly if your ID sales start to exceed where your own expectations were it gets a little tough to add hours as fast as the sales start to come and it takes a while to catch up to that. There could have been a bit of that as well. But I wouldn't say there was any one particular area that would stand out. It's really pretty strong across-the-board cost controls from many locations.","Rodney McMullen","One of the other things that we mentioned on the first quarter, we were pretty aggressive on incrementally investing hours in some places. Some of that you begin to get the flow of it and you understand where does it make sense and where doesn't it make sense as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Thank you for all the color, and good luck for the half back.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","And next we have a question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, guys, two things. Do you think \u2013 when you look at the momentum the business has and the things you have to invest in, have we gotten to a point where it's really hard to keep ex-fuel EBIT margin to just up slightly, right, without making investments that you don't think have a return? Or do you think we're just in a period here where timing of investments have been slower and that's partly why you're getting the 20 basis points?","Rodney McMullen","When you look at the business overall, I would still feel that slightly improving is where \u2013 is the right thing long-term for the business and what creates the most sustainable long-term value for the business and obviously, then flow-through to our shareholders. It's never as easy to be exactly precise every quarter in terms of where you invest and how does the margins flow through, and so I feel good about where we are, but I certainly don't believe as I look forward to cause us to do anything to adjust the guidance we've provided. I don't know, Mike, any additional\u2026?","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, and one of the things to keep in mind, John, as you know we have a portfolio of things we want to invest in over time. And these aren't promotional activities, to your point we aren't going to go out and have crazy promotional activity that's not going to be sustainable and drive long-term growth but we have a portfolio of things we want to continue to invest in and you know frankly some of the strength we're experiencing today is on the backs of some of the investments we made in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you make a little bit of an investment and then several months later you start to see the fruits of that investment. And that's one of the things that's leading to the strong IDs we've had in the first half. And we've tried to get into this rhythm where we're more diligent about when we invest, how we invest balanced up against consistent results. And I think we're doing as good a job as we've ever done and we still have that portfolio of areas where we would like to invest in.","John Heinbockel","And then, Rodney, you talked about the organizational structure which is quite different than you've had as far back as I can remember. You said sort of right for this time. Maybe more specifically, what do you think the structure gives you benefit-wise and then it does sound like a lot of the guys will have more direct reports than they did before? What do you have to do if anything different in how you run the business tactically to account for that? The people be overseeing more than they had previously.","Rodney McMullen","Well, a big part of that is just the growth that the team has had. I feel very comfortable that the growth they've had as leaders will allow them to have a little broader span of control than they've had before. As you know we're incredibly fortunate to have such a great depth of people and we're incredibly fortunate that they've been at Kroger for a long time so they really know our business well and understand what we're trying to get done.","For me it really does eliminate one layer of decision-making and it really does streamline our ability to make decisions. And the team is working together so well as a team. And I'm just really excited about going forward. I think it will just make it a lot smoother in terms of how we operate on a day-to-day basis.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, John.","Operator","And the next question is from Stephanie Chang of Credit Suisse.","Ed Kelly","Hey, guys. It's actually Ed Kelly here asking a question for Stephanie.","Rodney McMullen","Hey, Stephanie.","Ed Kelly","So I guess my first question for you, well, my one question.","Rodney McMullen","Your one question. Very good.","Ed Kelly","I have a follow up. So just related to IDs. I mean, your IDs are clearly exceeding expectations. You're raising the full year guidance for the ID again this quarter. I would guess that the level of inflation is less than what you probably thought coming in to the year. And Mike you talked about it with tonnage right being the strongest that it's been in some time. Could you just maybe help us understand how you're driving such strong growth in the business and maybe even what's surprising you as you look at the top line performance today?","Rodney McMullen","It's a great question. And to me, the thing that is so important about what Kroger has been doing for a long period of time, not just in this quarter is really focusing on multiple aspects of connecting with their customers and associates. So it's really we continue to improve the products that our customers have. We \u2013 our merchandisers continue to find new ideas and new products. Our operators continue to improve execution and figuring out ways to take costs out of the business and we continue to take that and invest in what the customers tell us is important.","So it's really all of those things working together. The thing that you never know is how will competitors react to what you're doing? And how \u2013 customers continually change and how do you make sure that you're staying out in front of those changes? So far this year, we're incredibly delighted with how we've identified how the customers evolving and changing. And connecting with those customers on a deeper, deeper way. Our customers tell us from the way that our associates serve them the products we deliver, the prices that we've continued to improve what we're doing, and it's really the combination of all those things working together.","Ed Kelly","Maybe just a quick follow up here on inflation. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to expect inflation to slow throughout the rest of the year. We have I think heard from one of your smaller competitors yesterday about particularly produce and maybe produce bottoming and getting better. So could you maybe provide a little color on some of the categories and how you see that progressing throughout the rest of the year?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, Ed, as I said in my prepared comments the produce picture, actually, the deflation slowed. And actually if you were to look at the very end of the quarter was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks. Nothing to write home about. But it was deflationary for the quarter but got less and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter. You continue to see other categories out there that have a mixed bag. Grocery is still let's call it just north of flat. Just a little bit of inflation and that's a big driving factor in it. The other one to keep out, to keep in mind as you think about inflation is pharmacy is a big inflationary area that I spoke of as well. The generic costs continue to go up. It's the earlier question on the headwind from gross margin in pharmacy it's one of the reasons why that headwind exists because you can't pass that on as quickly as the cost of the underlying pills go up.","So it continues to be a mixed bag. You're seeing some of the meat complex get less inflationary. And in fact deflationary in some areas but still some slight inflation in other areas. Seafood's a little deflationary right now. But it continues to be a little bit all over the board.","Ed Kelly","Okay. Thanks, guys, and congratulations, Mike, by the way.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Hey. Great. Thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations as well. Wanted to ask on the digital initiatives. You guys had said that a few more divisions now have the pickup at store capabilities. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in terms of traction usage there? What may be in the basket and then maybe kind of some thoughts going forward for further rollout?","Rodney McMullen","Well, they give you some insights. It's what we find is some customers enjoy shopping that and in addition to still buying stuff in the store. So it's \u2013 and you've heard us talk a long time about on digital we really do believe it's an \"and\" and not an \"or.\" And all it is trying to offer one more way of a customer engaging with us so that they get engaged with us the way they want to versus the way they have to.","And what we find is the customer feedback has been very positive for some customers. But it's not all customers. And the learnings that we were able to get from Harris Teeter is they were able to accelerate teaching us how to do it and then our store associates are doing a great job of executing against that.","In terms of specifics on going forward, the only thing really I would say is that it continues to be something that we test and we'll kind of \u2013 the pace in which we go will really be driven by how fast the customers engage with us. And one of the things that we're trying to do as a company is pace things based on our ability to execute against it. And the customers' connection with it. So I wouldn't be able to give you specifics right now because we really don't have specifics yet.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. No, that is helpful. Thank you. And maybe just as a follow-up I'll stick with the digital initiatives. And I know you guys had said you're continuing to see really nice growth in the loyal households. Have been there any changes on your end? Since the exclusivity with what was done humvie [ph] you know over the past couple of quarters has changed. Has there been any change in your approach to getting to know those loyal customers and who else maybe you are working with or not going forward?","Rodney McMullen","I wouldn't say there's been change. The thing that's probably the biggest difference is the leadership team at 84.51 is involved in every meeting now. And it's things when you're trying to make a decision on what you do, the folks who are around the table and they have great insights so you really having those insights as part of the decision at the front end rather than at the back end of the conversation. So the biggest thing is just the quality. To say that we get additional insights I wouldn't say there's additional insight so far. I would say there's a lot of additional projects that we're working on that should help us going forward that I feel very confident in, that it just makes it easier to get those things done rather than having to negotiate with the third party.","Vincent Sinisi","Right. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much, and good luck.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Ken Goldman","There's been so much change in Southern California amongst some of your larger peers. And I realize it's not easy, maybe it's impossible to quantify, but can you give us a sense for how much those changes have either benefited you or created a more challenging competitive environment? Just thinking about some of the issues that Haggen has had, some of the changes Albertson's has put into place. If you can address that at all, I'd be appreciative.","Rodney McMullen","That's one of those where obviously it's a good question but hard to answer. When you look at our business in total in Southern California, we're very happy with where we are. But the thing \u2013 the biggest thing that we think is driving it is our associates are doing a great job and our leadership team there in terms of improving how we serve our customers. Now, whether it's things customers do or competitors are doing that cause our customers to like what we're doing better, that I don't know. I think it's always important to remember that in Southern California, Costco is actually one of our biggest competitors. Whole Foods would be a huge competitor there. You have a ton of really high quality independents there. So the competition there is very diverse and more than just the Safeway and Albertson's and their merger and Haggens.","So I really \u2013 it's hard to say. A certain part is because of whatever somebody is doing. And we're really much more focused on how are the customers telling us we're delivering against what they're asking for. Mike, anything you would want to add to that?","Michael Schlotman","No, I agree. When there's any kind of disruption in the market, we look at it as an opportunity from a positive standpoint, not a woe is me or what's going to happen? How are we going to deal with this? And when names change on banners, when people may go to market differently, the opportunity always exists that folks may look for a different place to shop that didn't do that in the past. We want to make sure that Dawn and her team continue to do what they're doing to excite our customers and associates in Southern California.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. And then my follow-up, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly. You did say I think 3Q QTV ID sales x-fuel sometime what we saw in 2Q, right? So far anyway?","Michael Schlotman","What I said is quarter-to-date it's pretty similar where we are in quarter two.","Ken Goldman","Right. Right. Thanks very much, guys.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks. Take care, Ken.","Operator","And our next question is from William Kirk of RBC.","William Kirk","Thank you. I have a question on Simple Truth. I think it's in some of your convenience stores now. I was just wondering how the brand's performing in that channel and how many C-stores it is in, I guess.","Rodney McMullen","I'm looking at C-stores for two days and I already got it in there. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. How many it's in or how broad the...","Michael Schlotman","On a few select items, it's in pretty broad in a lot of our convenience stores but it's pretty narrow. It's early in the process. And we're really trying to learn how broad can the brand go and who all connects with it? As you know, historically, convenience stores isn't a place you go to for healthy offerings and we are trying to make sure that the customer, if that's what they want, they can find what they want. So it's early in the process but we are trying to learn how far the Simple Truth brand can go.","William Kirk","Okay. Thank you. And then on the M&A opportunity environment, we saw repurchases come down in the quarter. Leverage is back to where it was pre Harris Teeter. How are you feeling about the M&A environment and opportunities out there?","Rodney McMullen","I would say our M&A appetite is the same as it's always been. If the right opportunity comes along and it's the right set of stores, right set of assets, and right management team, we would think about it. There's not a lot that happens in the space that doesn't come across our desk. I wouldn't read anything into the share buyback coming down in the quarter to signal something on M&A activity. We were pretty up-front that we expected to front-end load our share repurchase program, and really what you're seeing in the second quarter is the use of stock option proceeds and the tax benefit from that to repurchase shares to offset that dilution. And we're comfortable with our leverage where it is and it allows us a lot of flexibility. And keep in mind, we are increasing capital which consumes some cash as well.","William Kirk","Okay. That's perfect. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania","Hi. Good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Good morning.","Kelly Bania","Thanks for taking my questions. I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the HEMISFARES' rollout. It sounds like that would be a premium quality, premium price point category. And just curious, in exactly which categories are you going to be launching that? How many stores? And really just stepping back and thinking about how does that come to fruition at Kroger? What's the idea process in terms of bringing that to market? Was that borne out of an 8451 kind of data science project? Or just any color on how that comes to market.","Rodney McMullen","Well, the biggest thing is it's really our Corporate Brands team would use the insights from 8451 plus other research they've done. We find customers are increasingly becoming foodies. And it's really trying to figure out how do you find great products that will satisfy that foodie need experience they want in a way that is actually a very affordable price. And if you look at the quality of this product, if you would go to a restaurant and eat food \u2013 eat something of this quality, it would cost four or five times as much as what it costs with us. So customers get to experience something that's very unique that's outstanding quality. And it's really the team searching across the world finding items that are very, very unique and very regionally based. The initial items \u2013 I actually don't know how broad it is. I can tell you the ones I've tried would be more pasta and sauce-based and olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Those types of items are the ones that I've tried. So the things I've tried are more based from Italy, but I'm sure there's others. It's just that's the ones I'm familiar with.","Michael Schlotman","And the whole idea of HEMISFARES is to allow our customers to take a journey of food experience around the globe without having to leave home. And it will be very specific on the packaging where the product's from. The folks at our Corporate Brands who have procured this actually have met with and have visited with and helped with the folks who manufacture this product or produce the product on-site in their home country. And some of this product it's the first time that anybody's gone through the trouble of importing the product with some of the items in into the U.S. that we have. So they've done a phenomenal job with this and we're really excited about yet another great offering for our customers in the stores.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, we would expect it to be in almost all of our stores. We think most customers will want to engage with it. On some of the items, there is a limited amount of production. So it's \u2013 it's not something that you can just go out and produce twice as much if it sells twice as much.","Kelly Bania","That's very helpful. And then just wanted to ask another question on deflation and some of the categories. I think you mentioned that all departments was still comped positive even though you had some deflation in dairy and produce and maybe seafood for the quarter. So I was just curious how you manage that. Do you do some incremental promotions in those categories in order to drive volume and increase the comps there when you experience deflation or how do you manage that so stably?","Rodney McMullen","Well, a lot of times it depends on what's driving the deflation. In some categories, you have deflation when the product is at its peak and tastes great. If you look at like, produce, usually if there's deflation that means there's tons of product available, and it's really great product so you end up selling more. In other areas, when you have deflation you're able to give such a great value for the customer for the item, so you end up promoting it more and the volume grows. So it's \u2013 we would drive our promotions based on what our insights tell us that customers like and at what point they like versus trying to just make sure we have every department positive. But fortunately, every department was positive identicals. And I know Mike you were looking up some of the specific numbers?","Michael Schlotman","No, I was just looking \u2013 when you look across the departments, the strength of whether you look at the \u2013 just the IDs or the inflation adjusted ID sales, it's really pretty remarkable how broadbased the strength of that \u2013 of the momentum is in various departments. I mean we had some departments that even on inflation adjusted basis were still double-digit ID sales inside their department. And I'm excluding fuel and pharmacy from that. So it's \u2013 at the end of the day it's really fundamental that I spoke of it earlier why we're so cognizant of what volume we're driving from a unit basis because that's at the end of the day what drives your business.","Kelly Bania","Great. Thank you.","Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Kelly.","Operator","And next we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Ohmes","Oh, thanks for taking my question, and, Mike, congrats on the promo.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Robert Ohmes","Just actually two kind of quick ones. You know, Mike, I think you were alluding somewhat to the wage pressures. Can you walk us through is the wage pressures a lot more than normal for Kroger right now and is that sort of a broader economic thing? And then maybe tie into that so maybe more commentary on any changes you're seeing in your overall customer \u2013 HEMISFARES sounds like more upscale private label launch are you seeing change in amount of trade-up going on or any changes in different levels of your customers' behavior would be helpful. Thanks.","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, the comments I made earlier weren't directly related to any wage pressures. It was actually the \u2013 our own decision and Rodney mentioned it as well, of certain departments where we invested some incremental hours in those departments to drive a better customer experience. And it also happens to be departments where some of our tonnage has been very strong as well. So those hours would have ultimately been in the stores anyway but it was in advance of that.","The wage pressures I would say aren't really any different than what we spoke of in the first quarter. There continues to be some out there. We're cognizant of trying to deliver the right overall package to our associates from a solid wage, a good healthcare package and a retirement plan as well. And we're a little different than a lot of our competitors where we're balancing all three of those for all of our associates.","As it relates to HEMISFARES, I would put that in the category of the private selection and Simple Truth range where it is more of an upscale product. And very high quality product. And it's \u2013 but it does wind up having fairly broad appeal to a lot of folks because when you really step back and dissect a lot of customers, there are many customers who on some items are a budget shopper, on other items they wind up splurging on particular items. And these can be the kinds of items those folks wind up splurging on while in other departments they're perfectly happy with an entry level price point or a banner brand that's a lower price point for them. I would say that the HEMISFARES as it develops in private selection and Simple Truth as that mix shifts towards those it is actually one of the things that is helping to drive our mix to be a little bit different than it has been historically as well.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, the thing that's so hard to tell I don't think it's so much economy based as customers clearly want high quality food. So if you look at the area's natural and organic, Boar's Head, Starbucks, sushi all those areas all have strong nice growth. So it's really \u2013 it really appears to be much different than just economy based. When you talk to customers they are definitely interested in saving money. There is no doubt about that.","Robert Ohmes","Got it. Thanks very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Robert Ohmes","Thanks.","Michael Schlotman","Take care.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Hi. Good morning.","Rodney McMullen","Morning.","Alvin Concepcion","And thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Alvin Concepcion","I'll keep it to one question. Just wondering if you can talk about changes in the competitive promotional environment for both the overall business and the natural and organic part of the portfolio? Are you seeing anything different as the second quarter progressed? And even third quarter to date?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, as you know, when we look at competition we always assume that competition's going get more aggressive going forward than it's been in the past. And we always find that if that doesn't happen then life's easier. It's just the way we've years ago learned to do our business plan. We wouldn't see anything that would be major in changes. There's always a certain promotion or you'll see things that different competitors do. And you'll see it even within weeks changing. So there isn't anything that I would say is a huge change in second quarter versus first quarter.","Alvin Concepcion","Thank you very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks.","Michael Schlotman","Take care, Alvin.","Operator","The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies.","Mark Wiltamuth","Hi. Good morning. Certainly had a nice bounce the fuel margins here in recent months. If some of this persists, would you anticipate reinvesting that back into the business? Or do you think that would \u2013 you'd let that flow through to the bottom line?","Rodney McMullen","It's obviously a good question. It's one where I don't think I would really be able to answer it at this point because it really depends what's going on in the marketplace and what we think is the best use of that. So at this point I really wouldn't think it would be appropriate to answer it.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. And then just curious on your click and collect experience in those newer markets. Are the customers signing up for some of those longer term fees like the monthly or annual fees? Or are they gravitating more to the pay per visit approach?","Rodney McMullen","You actually have customers doing all three. I would say the most customers are on the two extremes. They do the yearly approach or the per order approach. But it's not one of those things where you see 80% of the customers going one way or the other.","Mark Wiltamuth","Can you tell if it's incremental in those new markets?","Rodney McMullen","Some of the basket would be incremental but it's still so early that it's \u2013 the answer I gave you is what we're seeing but I wouldn't use a whole lot of basis off of it because the sample size is still too small.","Michael Schlotman","It's a data point not a trend.","Rodney McMullen","Yeah.","Mark Wiltamuth","Okay. Thank you, and congrats a good quarter.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mark.","Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Mark. Take care.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital markets.","Andrew Wolf","Thanks, and good morning. I want to follow up on the volatility that you cited in the product costs. First on pharmacy inflation with generics, can you quantify or even specifically or directionally how much that affected gross margin?","Rodney McMullen","Yeah, I wouldn't talk about a direct effect on gross margin but I will tell you that pharmacy inflation in the quarter continued to be above 90%.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. And again, that wasn't pass through due to the contracts and so forth?","Rodney McMullen","Well, you have contracts out there that you have to wait until you can pass it through. But also keep in mind as generic inflation happens, we have $4 30-day supply and $10 90-day supply and we haven't changed those price points either.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And when you talked about managing inflation and deflation, you had a good follow-up I thought on the pricing versus market share. Let me ask you about just on the inventory side. Does Kroger try to either go long commodities or inflating or be a little short those are deflating? Or is it when you talk about managing, is it much more about being sharp on pricing and managing it between \u2013 using price to lever either market share or profitability?","Rodney McMullen","We do some things for consumption in own manufacturing plants when we look at supply of products and the supply chain that is out there. We don't go overboard on hedges and we really don't use hedges so much. It would be cash purchase contracts to lock in a price for a period of time. We typically don't get too excited about doing those things unless the current prices and projected prices are trending below a five-year rolling average because it's \u2013 if you talk to people in the oil industry today, oil's only going do one thing and that's go down. When oil prices are going up and you talk to somebody in the oil industry, they're only going do one thing and that's go up forever. And I would say most people in the commodities world have that view.","So we're very careful about how we do it. The amount we consume is actually pretty large so we try not to be \u2013 I use the term a lot internally: I'd rather be approximately correct than precisely wrong. And if I make too big a bet one way or the other, I'd probably be precisely wrong.","Andrew Wolf","Last thing. So that \u2013 what you just described is only for the vertically integrated part of the business, the manufacturing? It doesn't permeate to retail at all, or does it?","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, so for example, I wouldn't go out if I see something happen in produce and try to hedge the apple crop this fall. You probably can't effectively do that anyway, but we do things with growers, trying to lock up fields and things like that, but that's more to make sure we have the exact product we want, not necessarily \u2013 we do that regardless of the inflationary environment.","Andrew Wolf","Okay. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Andrew \u2013 Andy. One more question. We have time.","Operator","Yes. And that last question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Brian Cullinane","Hi. This is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to talk broadly \u2013 your business model is clearly unique and advantaged with the data technology that you guys have. I just wanted to touch on how you guys think about expanding and whether it's through square footage growth and acquisitions or building more stores, getting your store and you're offering to more consumers kind of in areas that you're not currently in?","Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look in terms of going to territories that we are not in at all, as you know, historically, we've done that through mergers, and we're always, as Mike mentioned earlier, looking out for the right one to do something with. We're finding incredible opportunity on fill-ins and most of the incremental capital that Mike talked about is what we're finding is incremental project opportunities for great projects in existing markets. And right now, that's the highest focus. Now, that doesn't mean that we wouldn't go into a new territory, de novo, at some point.","Brian Cullinane","Great. And any thought to \u2013 you're spending more on capital, but to accelerate any of that with the success that you're having with some of the new stores and new projects?","Rodney McMullen","Well, we feel like we already are. If you look at the incremental capital that we're spending, and we continue to push that. So you're always looking for opportunities to grow, but grow and make sure you execute, and we feel like we have started picking up that pace.","Michael Schlotman","Yeah, I prefer an environment where I have a bunch of division presidents upset with me that they have great projects that we haven't been able to fund because of our capital, what they would call capital constraints, and spending $3.3 billion this year doesn't sound real constrained to me. So if they weren't clamoring for more dollars, I'd be nervous about our opportunities, but as long as they're clamoring, I feel good about where we are.","Brian Cullinane","That's great. Thanks very much.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Brian.","Rodney McMullen","Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11. I know that many on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to mourn those we lost on that horrific day and to honor their memory through our support for police, fire fighters and other first responders, as well as the military and their families. At the 9\/11 \u2013 I recently had a chance to go to the 9\/11 Memorial and Museum and it's incredibly touching, and I'm sure most people on the call have, but if you haven't, it's well worth seeing and it really does make you appreciate all the things that the police, fire fighters and other first responders did on that morning.","Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. One of the most exciting things about working for a growing and expanding company is the additional opportunities it creates for associates. Many of you would agree that Kroger is a place where you can come for a job and stay for a career. When I ask associates and managers why they've stayed, most tell me they fell in love with working with people, our customers and associates, or they found a deep passion for food. Often, it's both. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 70% of our store managers started as hourly associates. I believe there are many young people working for us today who will become our future leaders and will be having Mike's role and other senior leaders' roles, and mine.","Our associates are people who care who want to connect with something bigger and make a difference in our communities every day. We ask candidates to imagine you at Kroger, because whether you're looking for a flexible part-time job or for a lasting and rewarding career, you can find it here. And we're looking for friendly bright people who want opportunities to learn and grow. This is such an exciting time to be at Kroger. Together, we do make a difference.","That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for joining us today.","With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","I am very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which puts us on target to deliver the identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth we promised for the year. Kroger's second quarter operating performance and financial results show that the common thread in our story is consistency.","We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, maintained return on invested capital and expanded FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Every supermarket division and every department had positive ID sales.","We controlled costs throughout the business. As you know, we announced a merger agreement with Harris Teeter, a company we have admired for a long time, which will expand Kroger's footprint into new exciting growth markets. And customers continue to tell us our associates are improving their shopping experience.","As we've shown quarter after quarter, our consistent execution of the Customer 1st Strategy deepens customer loyalty, increases sales and creates sustainable shareholder value. As you know, the list that I've just covered was prepared in advance so that we could formally review the quarter that we just finished. I'm not sure it does the quarter justice, so let me depart from our normal script and describe our results this way.","We've just completed what is nearly 10 years of positive identical sales growth. We have invested in price for each of those 10 years when compared to the year before. At the same time, we focused on lowering our costs. We've actually lowered our costs now for over 8 consecutive years.","Last year, in our investor meeting, we raised the guidance for our long-term earnings performance expectations. In fact, for the past 2 years, and our guidance suggests that this 2013 would be the third year, we've been performing within this new higher earnings per share growth range already. Plus, don't forget the dividends.","Also, last October, we offered a number of other keys to our successful growth plans for future years. Everything you're hearing today in our quarter suggests we're on the path to successfully achieve all of those goals that we set out for you last year in October.","Maybe even more important, the progress we've achieved these past 10 years sets a wonderful foundation on which to build for an even brighter future. And the most important part of all is that the team at Kroger is large, broad-based, with dedicated associates, team Kroger, who have collectively come together to achieve these results. And it is that combination that I think is unmatched in the industry today.","The results achieved by our team, team Kroger, make me most proud. I don't use words lightly, this quarter especially, when I say we are very proud of the quarter we have just delivered.","Now I'd like Rodney to cover some more details about the second quarter. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we regularly seek customer feedback on how well we are executing in each of the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st Strategy. We continue to improve our performance in each area and our efforts are being noticed. Customers are telling us that our associates continue to connect with them by showing them that our people are great, our product selection and quality is improving, we are making the shopping experience faster and easier and we continue to give our customers better value for their money.","Doing the 4 keys together is what separates us from our competitors, competitors of both the past and the future, because the hard part is doing all 4 and doing them reliably. We are also more agile in balancing our investments in the 4 keys with the savings we realize and we are consistently improving the efficiency of those investments on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Our lower gross profit rate today means customers are saving nearly $3 billion a year compared to when we started this journey.","I want to echo Dave's appreciation and also thank our associates for keeping their focus on our customers and delivering shareholder value. We are very proud of reaching a merger agreement with Harris Teeter and we are especially pleased it has not diverted our associates' efforts to achieve a good quarter and continuing -- continue to driving the business.","One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth. It lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. And our loyal customers, on average, spend about half of every $1 with Kroger, which means we have tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores.","During the second quarter, we grew the number of loyal households. Our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.","Overall, customers continue to visit our stores more frequently, purchase fewer items per trip and buy more on a monthly basis. Total units sold were up compared to last year. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.6%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","As we've discussed throughout the year, and in fact for the last several years, consumer confidence continues to improve but at a slow and steady pace. Factors that affect consumer confidence at any given time include fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty, along with the overall state of the economy. We continue to monitor these factors closely.","Overall, we would characterize the economy as continue to improve but fragile.","Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 17 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis and excluding one-time items, as Dave mentioned before, we've improved this metric for 8 consecutive years and our year-to-date results have set us up to achieve our ninth consecutive year.","Now I'd like to update you on our corporate brands offering, which is one of our key differentiators for Kroger versus our competition. Our focus is on new products, which we are continually evolving as customer tastes change. We have modeled our team to facilitate a culture of innovation. This year alone, we will have introduced more than 650 new items by the end of the year.","In the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 24.5% of total units sold and sales dollars were 23.8%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified new labor agreements, covering stores in Indianapolis, Roanoke and Little Rock. We have several contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Seattle, Cincinnati and Dallas.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates.","Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will in turn help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.","Total sales increased 4.6% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter compared with $21.7 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.9% in the second quarter over the same period last year.","Net earnings for the second quarter totaled $317 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Net earnings for the second quarter of last year were $279 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.6 -- 20.46% of sales for the second quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 11 basis points from the same period last year.","The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $35 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. This is consistent with our original expectations. FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012 on a rolling 4 quarters basis, increased 9 basis points.","Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross profit rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today.","In the second quarter, our supermarket centers -- our supermarket fuel center's rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.14 compared to $0.136 a year ago, excluding the 53rd week. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.","On a rolling 52-week basis, return on invested capital grew slightly to 13.49% compared to 13.44% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to return on invested capital.","Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged: maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments.","You will see on our balance sheet that our current portion of long-term debt has decreased because of our recent financings and our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.77. We have not been repurchasing as many shares as we originally expected at the beginning of the year. This is purely because of our work to prepare for the Harris Teeter merger. This lower ratio gives us the flexibility to finance the Harris Teeter transaction and we are now well positioned to reestablish and maintain our targeted 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio, in line with our long-term financial strategy, within 18 months after the Harris Teeter transaction closes.","In fact, this puts us in a better position than we originally expected from a debt standpoint. We are committed to executing our financial strategy, including maintaining our current investment grade rating and repurchasing shares.","During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.4 million common shares for a total investment of $90 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $920 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters.","Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased property, totaled $507 million for the quarter compared to $444 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.1 billion. We continue to expect full year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.","Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.","Keep in mind, our long-term growth rate assumes no effect from year-over-year LIFO swings. A higher LIFO charge in any given quarter or year will lower the growth and a lower LIFO charge will increase the growth.","As you look at our guidance for the year, please note that we expect an EPS growth rate in the third quarter similar to what we reported today for the second quarter. We still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the third -- fourth quarter of last year on a 12-week basis. This is because we currently assume a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $41 million credit in the fourth quarter of last year.","The bottom line of this is we think current estimates for the third quarter are a little low and for the fourth quarter, they're a little high but by offsetting amounts. This is why we continue to be comfortable with the $2.73 to $2.80 per share level for the year.","We are increasing our identical supermarket sales growth expectations, excluding fuel, to approximately 3% to 3.5% for fiscal 2013. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%.","And now I'll turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Mike. I'm really proud of what we are accomplishing. We're growing in such a consistent way that it may seem deceptively simple. But the truth is that our hard work over the past 10 years since we began our Customer 1st journey has created a platform for sustainable growth. We are improving our connection with customers and associates, creating new jobs and strengthening job security and rewarding shareholders with consistent earnings per share and dividend growth.","Now we are happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So guys, 2 things. One, when you look at the 50% share of loyal households, when you talk to those customers and get a sense why they're not spending the other -- a larger piece with you, what do you typically hear from them? And then secondly, I know you want to -- you don't want to give too much detail here, but where do you think there are particular opportunities where you're way under-indexing with those loyal customers in certain product categories?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, thanks, John. If you look at why they're not shopping with us, it's kind of interesting. When we talk to them, they'll tell us they're actually giving us more business than they give us. And it's really a mixture of 2 things: one, things that they don't put on their Kroger list and they, just for the last several years, just put it on another retailer list; and the other part would be when they're out taking their kids to soccer practice or some other type of event, they'll just stop by and pick up a few items somewhere else. And most times, people will pick up a few extra things. The big opportunities, the easiest way to answer it, there are certain categories where we've significantly improved what we offer from a variety and a price standpoint that those customers don't realize that we've changed. And it really is trying to make sure the customers realize the improvements that we've made, would be the biggest opportunities that I could answer your question without giving a tremendous amount of detail. Obviously, there's a lot of detail behind that statement.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","But it's safe to say that the things that they might think of first in another retailer, whether it be paper, cleaning, HBA, I would think those are all areas where you probably under-indexed as opposed to food. Correct?","W. Rodney McMullen","That would be correct. Anything that's not food-related, we would probably under-index on.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, because I know you guys like to kind of peer around the corner a little bit, what's the current take? Because I know you've been a little bit skeptical about the whole food e-commerce channel. Do you think that will ultimately be, maybe not 2 years from now but 5 or 10 years, something people will -- it'll be more mainstream and something you want to start noodling around with? And if so, do you still think it would be more store-level pickup, a better option for the consumer, ultimately, than home delivery, as you think about it?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, we continue to experiment with it, as you know, in Denver, Colorado, we have for the last several years. We have a few customers that are very loyal to it, but it's modestly growing and it has modestly grown for a long period of time. We think, over time, it'll just be one part of the way a customer shops, along with physical assets too. So we don't think it's \"in place of,\" we think it's \"part of.\" And we're really focused on trying to deliver something along those lines. One of the things -- we're looking forward to merging with Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter has a pickup model in a lot of their stores. We don't have too much -- we have a little bit of insight, but it's very little at this point until we merge, because obviously, in some markets, we're in the same markets together. So you don't have the complete understanding of how successful it is, but we want to make sure we understand that and what pieces of that make sense to use in other places.","David B. Dillon","And John, I would add that we're thrilled in the meantime at the development of the whole digital world and how our customers are engaging with us. Everything from the Kroger app to the online work we do, to the downloading of digital coupons, has all been very successful for us.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. It's kind of exciting, but if you look at our digital app now, it's one of the top 2% -- it's in the top 2% of downloads off of -- from Apple.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","I had a kind of housekeeping one to start off with. I know you gave us the 4-quarter rolling on fuel. Did you have it for just this quarter on fuel penny profit?","W. Rodney McMullen","It was higher than the rolling 4 quarters. Go ahead and ask your second question and I'll get -- I don't have that exact number in front of me, but we'll get it.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. And then kind of along what John was asking, but maybe asking it a little bit different way, it's a more strategic question. Kroger's probably been the biggest share gainer in the industry for a long time, I think partly because you've just driven the price gaps down with Walmart and then also widened them with some of your conventional guise. But you also did a huge amount on service and perishables and merchandising. But I guess the question is, going forward, how do you envision share gains? Can you -- do you think you can keep up the same pace? And what's going to be the biggest mechanism to drive it?","David B. Dillon","Well, it's -- as I mentioned in my own comments, we see this as a sustainable model that continues to build on itself. And I think the most important fact that demonstrates that we believe this can continue for a very long time is the fact that roughly half of the business our best customers can give us, they are giving someplace else. And Rodney addressed that in his comments earlier. I think that's the best evidence. Now there's plenty of other evidence, too. Just the fact that we have 39 quarters in a row of positive identical sales illustrates that there's -- continues to be room to grow. And so we think that the future is still bright and that we see very good opportunity to grow our market share ahead.","W. Rodney McMullen","Hey, Scott, [indiscernible] in the quarter was $0.17 versus $0.164 last year. So while higher, the spread was about the same. So the profit margin per gallon in the quarter was 6\/10 higher and the rolling fourth quarter was 4\/10 higher. So the incremental was not that significantly different, even though the absolute number was higher.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","I appreciate that. And then my last question goes to kind of the current environment. Are you seeing anything different out there as far as your current trends go? But also, I wanted to talk about, there has been a lot of talk of some changes to the food stamp program. Some of those are just going to happen and then maybe there's going to be some further adjustments as we go forward into the fall. So both current environment and then how you're thinking about the current environment, vis-\u00e0-vis some of these changes that may roll through the food stamp program.","David B. Dillon","I'm not sure I followed the first part of your question about current trends. You're just talking about generally in the economy?","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, generally in the economy and your -- I guess your trends. I mean, are you seeing anything different out of the consumer that you've been -- that lifts your comps that you've produced this quarter? And then as we go forward, how are you thinking of your business, particularly on the sales line, with the pending cuts?","David B. Dillon","Well, first, as you saw, we moved the lower end of our sales guidance up, which should tell you that we are reasonably confident in what the second half of this year looks like. Sales so far, we have 3.5 weeks in this quarter. And while that's hard to predict, it's a whole quarter from that. But they are slightly ahead of where we were for the second quarter. So we're good -- we're comfortable with that picture. Rodney described the economy. The way we're thinking about it is it's still quite fragile but continues to improve and those signs of improvement are many. So there's lots of categories and items and areas that you would say are more kind of discretionary items that people are buying more of today than they were before. And the growth in areas like apparel and cosmetics and toys and greeting cards, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas, natural food, Boar's Head, cheese, prepared meals, all of those are doing really well and growing at good pace. Food stamps are still at a reasonably high level. They did kind of plateau for a while. And you could argue right now, in the last few weeks, anyway, that there's been a slight softening, but it's still at a very high level. And so I wouldn't read too much into that. Your question about food stamps is what happens if those get cut substantially. And I know there's lots of conversations in the Congress on that topic. We, of course, don't know how Congress comes out on that. We don't know how the states will come out on that. We do know that there's a reasonably high demand for food stamps. But remember that food stamp customers also spend some of their own cash on food. That's not their only source to pay for food with us. And while we have a lot of households that use food stamps, just the fact that we've seen some little softening in these last few weeks and yet the sales through the 3.5 weeks I've just mentioned is a little stronger than last quarter, that's a good sign, too. That even in a case where food stamps might get a little softer, we still think we can do quite well in sales. Rodney, do you want to add anything to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","No, I mean, it's something that we certainly look at and we work every day trying to make sure that we give all customers a better value for their money. And if you look at our digital app and everything that we're doing, we're trying to make sure that we continue to take costs out of the business so we can give the customers a better value for their money. So hopefully, the customer that's on food stamps would be able to take advantage of many of those opportunities as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So if you look back to the beginning of the year when you had a 2.5% to 3.5% projection and now raising the bottom end of that to 3% to 3.5%, what have been the biggest differences in terms of -- whether it be consumer behavior but just in terms of increasing confidence, et cetera?","David B. Dillon","Actually, the -- I think the answer is a silly answer, but it's a 6 months passage of time, that before we were looking at a whole 4 quarters, trying to predict where it was going to be, and now we've seen 2 of the quarters and we just have 6 months left in front of us to try to predict. And I think we feel more confident of that. But the factors are the same that I listed with Scott that helped get us to a confident level.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of -- if you look at the general merchandise sales that you've seen so far, could you just maybe give us some color in terms of what you've seen in the quarter? And will you also see pockets of opportunity as well?","David B. Dillon","Well, we certainly see pockets of opportunity. But in the GM -- I listed several GM categories that I've noted have improved, and GM on the whole has improved. One of the points I made earlier was that all of our departments had positive identical sales and GM did have reasonably good improvement. But it had been, for a long time, it had been more of a laggard. So we're glad to see some improvements there. You want to add anything, Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, I was just going to say, it was a little embarrassing, but in terms of the opportunity, I think we're really -- the Fred Meyer team is really having a tremendous amount of success, working deeper with all their divisions across the company and picking up some good new items across the company. We're having very good success on identifying the right items to add in our stores. We're starting to reduce some of our marketplace stores with categories different than what we initially did and very pleased with the success there. You could -- if you looked at it half empty, you would have said, \"Well, why didn't that happen 10 years ago?\" The half full is, \"At least it's happening now.\"","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then last question, obviously, with all the work that you've done with dunnhumby, et cetera, and with the relationship that you have with the customer, can you talk about how aggressive you are in terms of pushing mobile coupons, what you've seen in terms of customer response and just what the opportunity lies ahead?","W. Rodney McMullen","Wait. What? You said coupons, but I couldn't quite, Deborah, hear what you said right before coupons. Did you say mobile coupons?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of where are you right now in terms of pushing mobile coupons with your relationship that you've had with dunnhumby? And where are you in terms of working with the consumer? And what has been the customer response?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. If you look at -- the usage of digital coupons is significantly higher than the percentage improvement in the download of our apps. We're working with dunnhumby in terms of making sure those coupons are targeted for each customer. And it's -- it's some are at the segment level, some are at the individual customer level. And those would be some of the things that we continually work with and trying to improve. dunnhumby is putting a lot of resources on R&D today to get better and better at that in terms of targeting overall. And obviously, we're partnering with them to make sure that we continue to improve that. The percentage increases are so big that it really doesn't mean much because it's triple digits, but it's huge triple-digit increases.","David B. Dillon","And Deborah, just to illustrate a point, one of my favorite things on our Kroger app when I go to my own list, and I'm starting to make my shopping list and I want to download some coupons, it used to be I would just get a long, long laundry list of coupons that were available to download. And now, they're in the order of priority based on my actual shopping. And that would be true for any of our loyal customers that would have enough of a pattern to give us that. In that way, I don't have to go through 100 coupons to find the 4 or 5 or 6 that I want. And it's a terrific feature as an example. So we keep making improvements. About every 6 weeks or so, we make improvements in the app, which often is focused on the digital coupons and improving that experience.","W. Rodney McMullen","And overall, we communicate with about 9 million households on a regular basis, and all 9 million have unique offers based on their behavior.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, I was hoping you could just provide a little bit of an update on your thoughts around through the timing of issuance related to Harris Teeter, whether that's changed at all given the current market trends? And then, as we think about what you could potentially issue across the curve, you've previously talked about wanting some varied exposure, and given that you just came with 10s and 30s, should we expect more front-end issuance around that?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, thanks. Relative to the timing, obviously, their shareholder meeting's October 3 and then we'll still be waiting on final FTC approval after that. So we'll gauge where we are in the FTC process post the shareholder meeting and try to time it relatively close to when the transaction would close so we don't have a lot of negative carry. As we said back when we did the 10s and 30s a couple of months ago, we had several calls during that time and we were very open about the fact that if you wanted 10s and 30s from Kroger, you needed to be in this deal because the next issuance was going to be at the front end of the yield curve. It does 2 things. One, it does what you said, gives us exposure across the yield curve, but it also gives us a better maturity smoothing so that we have some debt coming due every year, so as we need to have the opportunity to pay off some debt to get our ratios at that 2x to 2.2x, we can do that by actually having some debt maturing.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just around your desire to maintain some floating rate exposure, how should we think about that? Do you have a targeted percentage or amount that you look at?","J. Michael Schlotman","Don't necessarily have a set amount. We currently, today, are extremely fixed. We were floating for a lot of this year until we did the bond issuance. In fact, post that bond issuance, you can see in our balance sheet, we have cash invested, which is some of that will go towards financing the Harris Teeter transaction. But I would expect our exposure of floating rates would be either -- it will probably be some combination of commercial paper issuances plus potentially a floating rate note issuance as part of the financing for the Harris Teeter transaction.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Karen Short, Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG","I just -- I wanted to focus a little bit on inflation and deflation. Looking back the last time when you saw a deflation, it also happened to coincide with a pretty challenging economic and competitive environment. And if I remember, you were investing pretty heavily in price, so selling gross margin was down pretty materially in that particular time frame. I guess looking into 2014, commodity costs appear to be coming down quite a bit and it looks like there is a potential for deflation. So I guess my first question is, what's your outlook for inflation into next year? And then the second question would be, how do you think about pushing the vendors kind of in the face of the potential for deflation and input costs, because I'm assuming you don't really want to be in a deflationary environment in the center stores?","J. Michael Schlotman","I guess your question on don't want to be in an inflationary environment, I can't do anything to change that, so our job is to make sure we can operate in whatever the environment gives us. At this point, I think there'll still be some slight inflation next year from everything we can see. Don't forget, while there are some -- certainly some commodities that are down, things like meat and some of the other categories continue to have some pressures out there relative to herd size and things like that. Now the chicken complex may come in as the corn crop gets harvested. And if it's as strong as it sounds like, that could help. But when you look at the grocery category, which is, in my mind, the one that's most important, we've actually had more inflation in the first half of this year than we had in the back half of last year. On the back half of last year, grocery inflation was under 1%. It was still inflationary, but slightly. And so far this year, it's north of 1% in the grocery category in both the first and second quarter. So I don't think -- I'm not really overly concerned about actual deflation. There could be less inflation, but that's still prices going up.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I guess the second question I had was just ROIC. Obviously, now that your compensation is tied to ROIC, you commented that ROIC might take a hit near term. And I guess the first question is why, because Harris Teeter's ROIC was fairly respectable. But maybe a little color there just on that comment.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I don't know that the comment said that it was going to take a hit. I said that what we're trying to describe is the fact that -- of the metrics we gave last October, it's going to be the one that takes the longest to have upward momentum on because we are increasing CapEx as we do it. And keep in mind, all the numbers we gave today and our expectations and our predictions and thoughts about the rest of the year are exclusive of Harris Teeter. Once that transaction closes, we'll obviously update our expectations as a combined company. But today, we just can't do that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky, Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Taking a look at your increased comps guidance, which is great to see, in a generally tamer inflation outlook for the second half of the year than maybe we were talking about on the last call, are you suggesting better volume growth?","W. Rodney McMullen","Certainly -- Chuck, this is Rodney. Certainly, based on what we see today and Dave mentioned earlier, what we're seeing the last 3 weeks or so and a little bit of the last part of the second quarter, we would feel a little bit better volume growth in terms of what our expectations are.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","What implications does that have for mix?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, as Dave mentioned, the -- we're having extremely good growth in the perishable departments, in those areas of the store and grocery is improving a little bit. So when you look at mix, we would expect it to probably be more driven by the center of the store than the perishables just because of the way we're starting out.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","So that would suggest customers doing more of their shopping at your stores?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing good growth in loyal households. And that growth as -- and we have total growth as well. So we would believe we're continuing to pick up a meaningful market share. And it's both in terms of new customers and loyal shoppers spending more with us.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","We've seen some of the marketplace stores in our travels, including some with the apparel in them. Can you comment on that group of stores?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, the marketplace is one of our many formats in terms of driving our growth. What we're finding is the Fred Meyer folks are helping us identify the right apparel items to have in. And customers are -- it's one more reason to come to one of our stores. Obviously, it's not typically on your Kroger list. But once you're in the store, you can get a great value for some reasonably trendy apparel at a reasonable price. So, so far, we're pleased. And we continue to add it in our new marketplace stores and as we remodel our marketplace stores.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Well, the one in -- maybe it's even open, will the new marketplace in Hilton Head have apparel?","W. Rodney McMullen","That one, I don't know. Mike actually probably knows that one better than me.","J. Michael Schlotman","You're right, it gives me grief that I'm the construction manager for that project. It's actually not a marketplace store. It's about a 90,000-square-foot supermarket. So it will be a big supermarket, kind of like when you think -- if you've been to our Anderson store here in Cincinnati or the Fort Mitchell store, it'll be more along those lines than a marketplace store. The site just wouldn't accommodate a 123,000-square foot footprint.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Todd Duvick, Wells Fargo Securities.","Unknown Analyst","Just filling in for Todd here. Most of our questions were answered. But just kind of wanted to circle back financial policy and just more of a confirming question, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So ultimately, I guess, everything kind of flushes through over the next couple of years, you'd like to be at 2x to 2.2x on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, is that correct?","J. Michael Schlotman","That's always been our long-term target. We typically, over the past several quarters, have been right around 2x. We were just under 2x at the second quarter. And just in anticipation of the Harris Teeter transaction, we were a little conservative from July 8 when we announced that until now on the use of cash to try to pre-lower that ratio a bit, if you will. We're actually a little bit ahead of where we are. And we feel comfortable we're going to be able to execute on all prongs of our financial strategy going forward, including the 2x to 2.2x. We think that's a good proxy for what it takes to maintain a BBB flat credit rating.","Unknown Analyst","Got you. And markets are hard to gauge a couple of months out and I know you have a meeting coming up. But can you talk to where that ratio would be maybe in '14 in terms of kind of a max or any type of range, how you think...","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes, I wouldn't -- I'm not going to speculate on where it will be immediately post the transaction. But if you assume a $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion acquisition price and all that debt goes on day 1, it's going to take a full year to add in any Harris Teeter EBITDA. Though the ratio is going to look pretty high on day 1, but by the end of year 1 and you have all of that EBITDA, if you just assume the EBITDA they've been generating, you'll probably get pretty close to a range of what we would expect by the end of the first full year post the transaction.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling, Goldman Sachs.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know you don't like to give a quarter-by-quarter guidance, but since you did make some references there, is there anything in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about? It looks like, even as you strip out some of the timing shifts, it looks like it embeds a little bit of a change in trend.","J. Michael Schlotman","I'm not sure what you mean by change in trend. I mean, if you look at purely the swing in LIFO, it's a $0.09 or $0.10 per share effect, just the swing of what last year's LIFO credit was and what this year's was or what this year's is projected to be. So it's a pretty dramatic shift between -- just on that line between the 2 years. If you were to neutralize that, I don't think you would -- I think you would find a quarter that's within our guidance range for the year. We've -- the first couple of quarters have benefited from the opposite of that and that we had a higher LIFO charge last year and a higher LIFO charge -- and a lower LIFO charge this year. If you were to neutralize the first and second quarter LIFO charges, our results actually were nicely at the high end of the range, not a 17% quarter like the headline reads, it's probably an 11% or 12% quarter growth, with LIFO neutralized. And that's why for the year, I mean, if you want to say it's a change in trend for the fourth quarter, mathematically, that's how it would work. But that's just because of the LIFO shift. One of the quarters has to be low when we're at 17%, the first 2 quarters in our guidance is 8% to 11% and it's purely that LIFO in the fourth quarter. It's not a change in the base business. Obviously, with raising the low end of our ID sales expectations, it's not any expectation that the business won't be strong in the fourth quarter.","Stephen W. Grambling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on, I believe it was Chuck's question. Just fresh produce has been highlighted as -- you highlighted it last year as a big opportunity at the conference. And we've also heard some re-emphasis from Walmart, the high-growth specialty players. Can you just highlight some of the things that you're doing that have been driving the growth there? And then, also, more a long term, as you think about the category, how it might be changing either in terms of pricing, the relevance, et cetera?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look -- as you know, we continue to add organic produce. We continue to work on shortening our supply chain. Our produce team has done a great job on connecting with local suppliers, which significantly increased the amount of local produce that we have, and we're doing a better job telling the customers about it. So it's really all those things together. From a trend, we would expect that to continue into the future. And on produce, we think we're going to be very strong and successful in produce, but we think probably some of the other companies you talked about, I think there's enough growth that all of us will be successful.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jason DeRise, UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Jason DeRise. A couple of questions. I wanted to potentially get a little bit more color on the FIFO gross margin x fuel, down 11 basis points, if you can share a bit of the drivers within that. And if that is indicative of the range that you think can be maintained as part of the 8% to 11% growth model long term as opposed to what has been happening in the past now that we've got a couple of quarters in there. And then I just wanted to follow up on the guidance change for sales without EPS. Is it just that the share count and interest view for the year has changed since the beginning of the year when -- or since last quarter when that guidance was updated?","J. Michael Schlotman","On the gross margin, as Rodney alluded to in his prepared comments, one of the things we've been focusing on, on a rolling 4-quarters basis, is the balance between the leverage of our ID sales, actual cost savings that we achieved and when and how we invest those savings that typically results in lower gross profit. But some of those investments actually wind up increasing OG&A efforts on people via training or something like that, so not everything affects the gross profit. So that gross margin is really dictated on our opportunity to save dollars elsewhere in the organization. The other thing that has helped that and until we cycle some of the bigger ones, clearly, pharmacy gross profit rates are up because generic gross profit rates are higher than non-generic gross profit rates. And that's one of the tailwinds that's in that number which, ultimately, will dissipate. I don't know if that gets to your FIFO gross margin question.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That helps. By any chance, would you want to quantify this quarter what the pharmacy benefit was?","J. Michael Schlotman","No.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I don't think so. I figured that out.","J. Michael Schlotman","That was a good -- it was a good driver. And what was your second question?","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just about the reconciling that the sales guidance has come up, but EPS is still the same.","J. Michael Schlotman","We raised our guidance, EPS guidance in the first quarter, to reflect the results we had in the first quarter. And we continue to post sales essentially just above the midpoint of our current estimate. And anytime you give a range, a company is continually striving to, at their worst, be in the middle of the range and hopefully towards the high end of the range. So it's probably safe to assume that we weren't expecting -- we really didn't want 2.5% sales for the rest of the year to drive the EPS we were giving and really needed sales closer to where we are. And as Dave said, with 7 periods now and the books at 3.3%, for the year to have wound up at 2.5% IDs, that would've inferred a 1.6% ID number in the back half of the year. We just don't see that in the books. We see a number much closer to where we -- we don't see that in the future. Rodney is touching wood by the way. We -- that's our expectation. And I would say it's in the -- both of those are within the range of what we expected when we began the year.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the part of the question that maybe I didn't hear on the first part, is it that the share count and the interest outlook is different than when that guidance was issued at the end of Q1? And I guess the Harris Teeter deal, is that sort of the reconciliation there?","J. Michael Schlotman","The share count and the interest have -- the share count a little bit of effect, but not a dramatic amount of effect on the full year. Interest really not, because for the period of time we were drawn on commercial paper until we termed that out a couple of months ago, we actually were lower on interest during that period of time than we expected. So for the year, we'll probably be a little better on interest than the original expectation. And that will actually help offset some of the lower share repurchases that we're expecting for the year. And I'll reiterate one more time, none of our guidance has any assumptions relative to the effect of Harris Teeter. When that transaction happens, we'll have to reset the bar on what our expectations are. But there's nothing in there relative to Harris Teeter. And one other thing I'll remind you about on those is our guidance for the year would also exclude any transition or transaction expenses related to that. So we'll call those out separately as they occur. We had a little bit in the third -- in the second quarter, but nothing that changed the ultimate answer. And again, we still have the expectation that Harris Teeter will be accretive in the first full year.","Jason DeRise - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. If I can squeeze one more in. With the new stores that you're opening up and I guess some of the remodels that you're doing, how is that progressing at the early stage? Are the stores generating the revenues that you expect?","J. Michael Schlotman","We're very happy with the early results in the stores we're opening. It's one of the reasons we're keeping our CapEx expectations and spend where we plan to be. And as we said last October, we expect to increase that a couple of hundred million a year. And I would expect, at this point in time, that 2014 would be a couple of hundred million higher than what we have out there as expectations for this year, again, excluding anything relative to Harris Teeter.","Operator","Your next question will be from the line of Andrew Wolf, BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I also want to follow up on the gross margin. This year's rate has improved sequentially quite a lot. And you guys signaled at your last investor conference that, I think, the rate of price investments Kroger needed was going to abate, so you'd need less going forward. So I just wanted to ask you straightforwardly, is that the major driver of the improvement in the gross margin rate, less contraction, to be precise, this year so far? I know you've called out other things like generic drugs, but is that one factor, if not the major one, one of the major ones? And what does that imply about the price environment in general?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well, if you look, I mean, we obviously have an overall price strategy in terms of our relative price value versus our competition. And we've had that for several years. And we continue to be very aggressively promotionally in terms of giving customers a good value on promotion. I wouldn't overread what this year's number is versus the long-term trend. We're really focused on making sure that we maintain our relative price position. We continue to improve our reputation with our customers. And we balance that with as we take costs out of the business, that we have a slightly improving operating margin. So it's really all 3 of those together. One of the things that's been helpful this year is the pharmacy that Mike mentioned. We're also having good success on reducing some cost of goods on some things that we're doing as well. So that's helping it. The other thing, we probably are investing a little bit more in service this year than a normal typical year. And that's something that, each year, you would balance based on what we see the opportunities in the marketplace.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And I just wanted to switch gears to labor negotiations. There's been some press reports and I think some Kroger officials have commented as well, that with the coming changes in health care in the system, the Affordable Health Care Act, there have been some changes to contract terms. Does Kroger view that these changes to be Affordable Health Care, coming from the Affordable Health Care Act, as something Kroger can use either to -- well, to reach its goal, which you've stated to have the competitive cost structures, particularly, when you think about the industry having one of the most generous health care benefits in corporate America?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Andy, for the question. The law really isn't driving -- the changes that you would have read about, the law isn't what's causing those changes. And as you've known Kroger for a long time, we want to make sure our associates and our family have access to affordable health care coverage. And we still are spending about $1.5 billion a year on health care. We would expect that cost to continue to increase even with the changes that you've heard us talk about. Every contract is separate. Every situation is separate. What we find in some cases, our health care plan is so much better -- a lot of spouses will be working. Our health care plan is so much better than a lot of the spouses would have. Spouses are coming to our plan on an increasing rate. And what we're trying to do is to set up where spouses that have coverage, they go to where they have coverage to, in some cases, to take it for that coverage. So overall, we're looking at each contract individually and it's the solution that works fast for that market for that situation.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just to follow up, I think in Dave's preamble, he talked about how growth has -- it sounded like it made a more amicable relationship with the unions. So am I understanding that correctly, that maybe the unions are more willing -- and I know each one is a separate entity, but in general, more willing to make certain helpful changes? Because I know Kroger is expanding and adding opportunity for more membership, for example.","W. Rodney McMullen","I guess I would never say that the union has been more helpful. I certainly believe the unions -- we continue to have a partnership to try to work together to figure out what's best for our associates. So I wouldn't say that -- they're not becoming suddenly easy to negotiate with. They're still looking out for their members. But when you look at it overall, one of the things that we're able to bring to the table is a growing company that improves job security. We're creating jobs that have -- and obviously, when you're a department head, you get paid more money than when you're not a department head. And it's those types of opportunities that we're able to provide for our associates. So it's really all those things together that will create a growing company, improves job security and improves what somebody makes on an individual basis because they're getting promoted.","Operator","Final question will be from the line of Edward Kelly, Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just had really just a couple of follow-ups, I guess. Mike, a question on generics. The pharmacy margin in general and the contribution from generics, I know you don't want to give the amount. But sequentially versus last quarter, how did the contribution compare? Was it similar, less?","J. Michael Schlotman","A little less.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A little less. Okay. And could you also give us an update on shrink? I know shrink was something last year that was a little bit of a headwind. I know you guys have been making some progress. Where do you stand on shrink today in terms of your progress and how you feel about that?","David B. Dillon","Rodney, you want to comment on that?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. Shrink is one of those where -- I don't know that I would ever say I'm ever pleased. We're certainly not satisfied, but we always work -- we're very careful when we are trying to improve our shrink result because it's one of the easiest ways to affect the customer's experience. So we don't want to have low shrink just for the sake of low shrink. We're not as far along as we'd like to be. We're making some progress in some of the areas of the business, but it's one of those things where it's a constant balancing between the pieces. So overall, the answer to your question is we're making progress in some areas. We're still not where we want to be, but we're making sure we do it on a balanced basis.","Edward J. Kelly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a final question for you. I know you guys recently announced the Harris Teeter deal. What's the M&A environment generally look like today? Are you seeing more opportunity, less opportunity? Just curious as to your general view on what's available.","David B. Dillon","Ed, I'll give you a general comment and Mike may want to add more specifics if he wants. But I think we see the environment pretty much like we've been seeing it, that there's lots of things we look at regularly, but very few of them actually fit things that we think are worth doing and worth spending the money on and investing our time. And obviously, we've described Harris Teeter as one of those companies to merge with them. We've admired them for a long time and it's a kind of asset that really helps us grow into a new market. Do you want to add anything else to the environment?","J. Michael Schlotman","No.","David B. Dillon","Okay. So we're going to wrap up and I had just a couple of comments...","J. Michael Schlotman","I just wanted -- Paul Heldman was nice enough to point to me in my prepared remarks on, I said corporate brand units were up, market share was 24.5%. It's actually 25.4%. I transposed. I just wanted to correct that before we got off the call. Sorry, Dave.","David B. Dillon","Well, that's good for the record to get that in there. Thank you.","So before we end the call, though, as we often do, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who we encourage to listen in on this call. October is Breast Cancer Awareness month across our company. Associates in the offices and the supermarkets and convenience stores and our plants, distribution centers, participate in many activities to honor and pay tribute to those who are fighting this disease. Including many local Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer events. I'm always moved by the outpouring of support and generosity that I see from our associates at events like these.","In the next few weeks, we'll also begin our annual Giving Hope A Hand campaign to support the fight against breast cancer in our stores. This year, we'll be featuring associates like Lori [ph], an apparel manager at one of our Fred Meyer stores in Oregon, who says, \"Losing this battle is never an option.\"","Lori and 20 other courageous women will share their stories of hope and courage on specially marked packages of our corporate brands and national brand products. These items will be sold exclusively in our stores from September 22 through October 5. And I encourage you to read our coworkers' inspiring stories at sharingcourage.com.","Well, that completes our call today. We want to thank everyone for joining us. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"12985":["The Kroger Co.

Details will be coming soon and we hope you can join us.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","With me to review Kroger\u2019s second quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.","As you know, Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years. Our success over time boils down to one thing, our relentless focus on the customer. That focus allows us to deepen our connection with customers and create shareholder value. The customer remains the center of everything we do.","The four core elements of our Customer 1st Strategy are as relevant today as they were when we first introduced them. How we invest each year to drive customer engagement changes regularly based on customers\u2019 changing needs and wants.","This showed in our second quarter results, as we returned to positive identical supermarket sales growth, and both loyal and total households increased. Traffic was up, unit movement was up and market share was up. Our customers\u2019 perception of our prices is excellent and we continue to get even better.","Based on our second quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we have confirmed our annual net earnings guidance. The operating environment will continue to be incredibly dynamic. But more importantly, customer behavior is changing faster than ever before.","For the last few quarters we\u2019ve talked with you about our expanded view of all the food our customers eat, and how we\u2019ve been working to redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We know that the massive, $1.5 trillion U.S. food market creates a unique and sustainable growth opportunity for Kroger. You\u2019ll see changes in the way we go to market as a leading indicator of the lens through which we view our market. We see anyone who sells food as competitors in the future.","Kroger has a history of successfully evolving to meet our customers\u2019 changing needs, because we put the customer at the center of everything we do. We are transforming today, too. We are reprioritizing and accelerating investments in our Customer 1st Strategy in order to anticipate and meet rapidly-evolving consumer demands to shop with us for anything, anytime, anywhere. Our transformation is all about redefining the customer experience.","As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance for 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018 as well. In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we have done for many years but will no longer provide longer-term guidance. This will provide needed flexibility in how we invest to position us for the future success.","We look forward to getting into the details of our goals and priorities at our upcoming investor conference in October. But in the meantime, I\u2019d like to begin to create a vision by sharing several ways we are redefining the customer experience to be America\u2019s inspiration and destination for everything food. We\u2019re doing this by combining our knowledge of food and our ability to personalize through the use of data analytics; we\u2019re doubling down on digital; and we\u2019re leveraging new and ongoing partnerships to deepen our connection with customers and drive revenue.","I\u2019ll take a few moments to share more about each of these areas where we have deep credibility from our past and are aggressively developing for our future.","Food retailing is more exciting than ever before, especially as more of us become foodies. Customers have nearly an unlimited number of options when you combine tastes, flavors and types of meals with the growing number of food outcomes that consumers are focused on. Those outcomes might include eating for health or for enjoyment, for example, or for lifestyle or performance reasons.","Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner our customers turn to for their meal needs because we know food and we know our customers better than anyone. Meals have always been our expertise. Kroger is often the one driving change and innovation behind the scenes.","We are very proud of the role we\u2019ve played for over a decade in making natural and organic products more affordable and accessible to America, especially for shoppers on a budget. We\u2019ve always believed that our customers shouldn\u2019t have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic. We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace. Today, Simple Truth is the biggest natural and organic brand in the country by volume. This market continues to provide a robust opportunity for Kroger.","Similarly, our culinary innovation team is bringing truly affordable and incredibly tasty meal kits to American households through our Prep+Pared offering. Just last week, we announced that we are expanding our offering of Prep+Pared to more than 50 stores in three of our divisions, Cincinnati, Louisville, and Ralphs.","Across Kroger, we know our customers better than anyone. We have a 13-year advantage of using data insights to connect with customers. Data analytics are fully integrated in our business, as 84.51\u00b0 helps us make merchandising, operations and marketing decisions. In the last year alone, Kroger has made more than 3 billion personalized recommendations to customers through product offers, promotions, recipes and more.","Data analytics is helping us win with Our Brands by identifying the best products to bring to market based on consumer behavior and taste trends. Research by an independent third party shows us that our customers favor Our Brands over national brands and competitor offerings. The strength of Our Brands is what our customers realize Kroger quality is superior, and at a very affordable price. It truly is quality without compromise. Customers get the best and most innovative quality at the best prices. We will build this momentum to be the premier private label destination in America.","Combining our love of food with our data expertise allows us to offer content that inspires. We recently launched a new My Recipes feature on Kroger.com that serves up a personalized selection of suggested recipes. The recipes offer greater diversity of meal ideas, all based on your individual purchase behavior. Our growing collection of recipes is also searchable by a variety of filters including seasonality, world cuisine, meal or dish type, and cooking style. While online recipes are not new, serving them up on a personalized recipe for your family is and customer and your family will love the new offerings. And this is distinctly Kroger.","Personalized recipes are just one example on how we are bringing the combination of food and data together to create new and highly-relevant customer experiences, especially through digital and ecommerce. Customers expect a great shopping experience and the ability to interact with us digitally or online in a seamless way. Our digital efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personal, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs. This includes our mobile app, for example, in addition to Vitacost.com, ClickList, Express Lane and home delivery. Today, we have more than 25 million digital customer accounts. As we said in our press release, our total digital sales are up 126%, driven by ClickList.","We operate more than 813 ClickList and Express Lane locations offering the convenience of online ordering and curbside pickup. By the end of the year, we will offer the service at more than 1,000 locations. Customers continue to respond exceptionally well to ClickList.","We know that in the future more customers will want the option of home delivery, so we are also testing various home delivery models with companies like Uber and Shipt and on our own in more than 150 stores. We will keep making the strategic investments to serve customers anything, anytime and anywhere in the near future.","With new entrants in a fragmented market, we\u2019re also transforming our business and building partnerships to deepen our relationship with, and create value for, our customers. We\u2019ve been preparing for new market entrants for years, and the fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households annually is a great strength when customers have more food choices than ever before. We continue to gain share in key categories like natural foods, produce and fresh prepared foods. We will continue to focus on growing our core business to generate free cash flow and deepen our personal connection with customers. These changes also create opportunities to work with our existing partners to deliver more value for customers and to identify new partnerships to create alternative revenue streams.","Now, here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to walk you through changes to our capital allocation process and long-term guidance. Mike?","Mike Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone.","We\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results, especially return to positive identical supermarket sales. That combined with strong market share, tonnage growth, and both loyal and total household growth demonstrates our ability to evolve with the changing preferences of customers. Kroger has the team, the skills, the knowledge, the scale and the data analytics to be a winner in food retailing.","Another positive sign is that we had overall product cost inflation for the first time since 2015. As you know, the change from inflation to deflation and back again is one of the toughest environments to operate in for our stores, and we\u2019re proud of our team\u2019s ability to manage through it.","Our Customer 1st Strategy has always guided our strategic investments to be there for our customers today and more importantly to where they are going in the future.","To undergo the transformation Rodney discussed, we recognize that we need to make these Customer 1st investments more aggressively, and faster than ever before. Like Rodney said earlier, we are eager to share the specific elements of our plan with you at our investor conference in October. But, today I will highlight two examples.","First, 84.51\u00b0 has helped us redefine space optimization for the entire store. As this comes to life, it will drive sales and operating profit growth. In the short run, there is a cost to doing this but we feel the return is significant. This is another example of using 84.51\u00b0 in new and innovative ways. Second, we\u2019re making sure we have the right products at the right cost and at the right retail prices for our customers. We are approaching these efforts, along with the areas Rodney outlined earlier, with even more focus and urgency than we have in the past.","For example, we\u2019ve already reprioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and by turning our capital allocation process upside down. We now look first for sales-driving and cost-savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Then, finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.","One thing I want to be very clear on is that we are not talking about a new strategy to replace Customer 1st. We are talking about better executing the elements of our plan to deliver on all four keys for our customers. As Rodney said earlier, our customer remains our focus.","We continue to see strong growth and amazing potential on Our Brands. During the second quarter, Our Brands sales grew more than national brands in our grocery, drug GM and meat departments. Identical sales for Our Brands also outpaced identical supermarket sales. The second quarter brought strong sales and unit growth, with Our Brands representing 27.7% of total units sold, and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.","All of this is consistent with the research we commissioned last year to give us an objective view on Our Brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private label foods. The research showed that the most-loved brands sold in our stores are Our Brands, above even the national brands. And in the blind taste tests, Our Brands outperformed competitive national brand and other private label products.","Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.217 compared to $0.198 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year.","Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.37, compared to 2.11 during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the incremental repurchase of shares.","Over the last four quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.7 billion in common shares, pay $448 million in dividends, invest $3.1 billion in capital, and merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million.","The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a key strength of our financial strategy. We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment grade rating. We have reduced our 2017 and 2018 planned capital investments by a total of $600 million to maintain this balance and flexibility. Return on invested capital for the second quarter, on a rolling four quarters basis, was 12.37%.","On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta and Dallas. We are currently negotiating an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in our Food 4 Less Warehouse Stores and with Teamsters for the Master Agreement. This fall, we will begin negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care, and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger\u2019s financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger\u2019s business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and create more career opportunities, and enhance job security, for our associates.","Turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of the year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we saw. Cost inflation trends for the second quarter were consistent by department, with grocery, liquor, produce and meat all positive for the quarter. Deli was deflationary and pharmacy continues to be inflationary.","We are confirming our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share. We are also confirming our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per diluted share. Our LIFO expectation remains unchanged at $80 million.","We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 0.5% to 1% growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance does not include any effect from hurricanes Harvey or Irma. Our insurance provides coverage and caps losses at $26 million for each event. Until the claim is finalized, it is difficult to provide an exact amount. And we expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for 2017.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","Rodney McMullen","Thanks, Mike.","I\u2019m often reminded of the saying, \u201cmay you live in interesting times\u201d. These are interesting times in our industry, and I know some of you wonder how Kroger can continue to thrive in such a dynamic operating environment. We have a history of evolving to meet our customers\u2019 ever-changing needs. The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes. That is what we are doing today. Through innovation, Kroger is redefining the food and grocery customer experience based on our core strengths.","Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within one-to-two miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, we\u2019ve been named America\u2019s most beloved grocery store several times. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. And, we have a track record of connecting with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives, as evidenced by our team\u2019s response to Hurricane Harvey.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Just starting I guess with your guidance. I guess, what I\u2019m trying to understand is, obviously you maintained your earnings guidance but you now have operating margins down 30 to 40 basis points versus prior 20 to 30. So, by my math, that\u2019s about $0.09 to earnings. And so, I guess, I\u2019m wondering, just to clarify, the offset has to be below the line unless I am missing something. And I just had a follow-up on the operating margin guidance change.","Mike Schlotman","The benefit comes from multiple places throughout the income statement, Karen. There are efforts underway that will make the operating margin decline that you saw in the second quarter, not as much in the third quarter. We feel very good about the health of the business today, the trend of ID sales, our efforts on cost of goods reductions and our efforts on productivity and operating cost reductions. When we combine all of those, we feel comfortable with the $2 to $2.05.","Karen Short","Okay. But within the change in the operating margin, right, so it\u2019s now down 30 to 40 basis points versus the prior 20 to 30. Can you may be just talk then a little bit about where -- that was a first half event then, and so, we\u2019ve already kind of seen that or is there more to come in terms of gross margin or operating expenses in the second half that we\u2019re not kind of -- or we haven\u2019t been previously contemplating?","Mike Schlotman","Yes. I am not going to go into every specific line of the income statement. But, we are seeing good flow of cost of goods coming in and good cost savings opportunities in the back half of the year.","Karen Short","Okay. And then, just one quick question, I guess on Bloomberg, you indicated sales in the third quarter to-date were off to a nice start. I think that\u2019s what you said. Maybe can you get a little more granular, meaning are they at the high end of your second half guidance or a little more color there?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. Currently quarter-to-date, and this is without the hurricane effects, we would be above where we finished the second quarter and we would be closer to the high side of the guidance range. The reason we exclude the hurricane is because one day it\u2019s a positive, one day it\u2019s not because of obviously one day you will have business that\u2019s up 100% or 200% and the next day it\u2019s basically zero. So, we just -- until we get completely through the two hurricanes and when we release third quarter, we will obviously give a lot more insight. But so far, we would be trending ahead of second quarter and closer to the top end of the range.","Mike Schlotman","And Houston is doing just fine. They have all the two stores back and operational and our warehouse is fully operational.","Operator","And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. I apologize that actually will be Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo.","Zack Fadem","Hey. Good morning, guys. I want to follow up on the ID sales. You mentioned the recent traction but your second half guidance would imply that you actually narrowed the annual range by 30 to 40 basis points. So, could you just talk about parts here, estimates, traffic trends and may be walk through the decision to narrow that range rather than just holding it steady or taking up the low end?","Mike Schlotman","Yes. And frankly, we talked about it a lot. And what our intention to do was really to take flat for the year off the table because we don\u2019t see that in the cards. We still clearly see 1% for the year in the cards. And our intent was really to get the notion of flat off of the table, maybe confusing to people so far today but that\u2019s what our intention was. We may not have done it as perfectly as we could have. But, we still think the high end of the original annual range is in the cards but we don\u2019t believe flat is in the cards, which is why we wanted to take that off the table.","Rodney McMullen","And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant, we would have had positive -- negative identical, excuse me, for the second half of the year. And obviously, we wanted to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect identicals to be positive and the trends that we\u2019re seeing so far, the identicals continue to improve.","Zack Fadem","And Mike, I also wanted to follow up on the quarterly EPS cadence that you provided last quarter. Should we still anticipate EPS up slightly in Q3 and then flat in Q4, excluding the extra week?","Mike Schlotman","We actually, purposely hold the quarterly guidance cadence out of the earnings release in light of focusing more on an annual earnings per share target. I don\u2019t see any big alterations to that guidance that we had last quarter. Halfway through the year, you kind of have to wind up with those kinds of numbers to be in the $2 to $2.05 range any way.","Operator","And now, our next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, Rodney, two strategic questions. Let me start with the space optimization project you\u2019re talking about. Sort of big picture and to a little picture, is that less center store, more fresh; is it less brands more private label? What are you doing there? And then, what are the costs, simply labor costs to rearrange, shelving and the like?","Rodney McMullen","In terms of how much it encompasses, it would be everything that you mentioned plus some. And as Mike mentioned in his comments on the space optimization 84.51\u00b0 is helping us look across the whole store and how do we use space. So, obviously, in some cases, it\u2019s continuation of adding more fresh space. It\u2019s also in terms of the products that we offer to the customer, every single item has to earn its right to be on the shelf and categories have to earn the right to have certain amount of allocation. So, it\u2019s all of those things. The expense would really be driven by two things. One, when you make some changes, there are some equipments that you would write off. As you make the changes, there is certainly the labor and the cost in doing the changes, plus some of the equipment gets written off almost immediately. So, it\u2019s both of those factors that is behind what Mike was mentioning.","Mike Schlotman","And if you move things around too much inside of a store, there is obviously disruption for short period of time that customers being able to usually navigate as we move a lot shelving and things around.","John Heinbockel","And then, secondly, when you talk about capital allocation, it sounds like you want to invest in existing stores more than new stores, at this point. So, what does that mean for your M&A philosophy? Does that suggest less of an appetite for M&A, does it suggest more of an appetite for digital M&A and less brick and mortar?","Rodney McMullen","I would say, the broad comment would be, from an M&A standpoint, we would be equally as excited today as two years ago, when we find the right person to partner with. And as you know, when we look for someone to partner, we\u2019re looking at somebody that brings things to us as much as we bring to them. We would continue to be aggressively looking at anything digital that adds capabilities. You may recall, in the past year and a half or so, we merged with a company called Market6 and another company called You Tech. And we were able to use in both of those situations, the 84.51\u00b0 and accelerate the work that they did and accelerate some of the work that we\u2019re doing plus brought a great amount of talent to our Company. So, we would increasingly look at curtain capabilities that somebody would bring to us and how do you partner with them in a way that would bring that capability. But for the right merger opportunity, whether it\u2019s digital or physical, we would be as excited today as two years ago, but it would obviously have to be somebody that fit in well with where we operate and has a business that\u2019s strong.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan.","Ken Goldman","Two for me, if I can. Have you -- in your opinion your competitors, and I know it\u2019s very soon, so maybe the answer is no, but have you seen new one or view yourself low at any prices yet as a direct result of price changes at Whole Foods? And I guess, can you talk a little bit about how your stores are doing the last couple of weeks? It\u2019s not that Whole Foods necessarily has lowered prices that much, although arguably they have, it\u2019s just that there has been so much news about it, just kind of trying to get a sense of really what you\u2019re seeing so far in the marketplace.","Rodney McMullen","Well, as you mentioned, Ken, it\u2019s only been a week and a half, so it\u2019s very early in the process. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago, and making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers, and we never felt like just because something is natural or organic, you should charge a premium for it. In terms of the impact, obviously, it\u2019s way early, but there isn\u2019t anything that would cause you to develop any point of view at all, in terms of changing trends, but it\u2019s only been a week and a half. So, I would caveat it a million different ways.","Ken Goldman","Feels like it\u2019s been longer in my world. But, thank you for that\u2026","Rodney McMullen","Obviously, the discussion around it has been longer than that.","Ken Goldman","Yes. It wasn\u2019t a very quiet August for many of us in this industry, I\u2019m sure not for you either. Can I just follow up on one thing? In terms of your guidance for the comps in the back half of the year, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on that, because the business is doing clearly in some ways better. Right? You\u2019re talking about comps being positive, positive tonnage, but the guidance does imply a fairly meaningful step down in the two-year stack in comp in the back half. And I know, there is many ways of looking at that. But that\u2019s one of the questions I\u2019ve gotten from investors this morning. I just wanted to see if you had a comment on that, if you could sort of help us out understand why you\u2019re sort of thinking that comps will be a little bit maybe a weaker on a two-year level, maybe that means fundamentally weaker or is that not how you look at it?","Rodney McMullen","I don\u2019t think -- I actually don\u2019t look at two-year stacks very much, because I sold whatever I sold last year and I\u2019m selling that plus more this year. And we feel very good about the underlying health of our business. As we said in the prepared remarks and in response to questions so far, ID sales so far in the quarter are pushing the high end of the guidance range. We grew loyal households, we grew total households, we have strong market share growth and strong tonnage growth. And I would also remind you that as our brands continue to gain strength and gain a bigger share of both units and sales that comes at the expense of a lower retail ring, which winds up being a bit of a headwind to reported ID sales. And we have been very aggressive with how we position those products inside of our stores.","Operator","And the next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. ","Ben Bienvenu","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for my question. On the digital revenue growth, pretty significant and obviously making progress there on the ClickList side. I\u2019m curious, does that have any meaningful contribution to the comp that you referred to in the quarter.","Rodney McMullen","It\u2019s a great question and it\u2019s hard to answer because the thing that we\u2019re trying to do for our customers is to do it in a way that\u2019s totally seamless. So, the customer continues to come into the store and shop, so we actually get more of their total basket. So, it\u2019s helping comps but it\u2019s helping comps from that total customer household and how much they\u2019re spending with us. So, it\u2019s helping identicals but it\u2019s really hard to say ClickList is X percent of it or Y percent of it. I don\u2019t know, Mike, anything want to add?","Mike Schlotman","It\u2019s clear that the customers love the service and it gives them an incremental connection with Kroger. And as Rodney said, it gives us a bigger share of their wallet, the longer they\u2019re engaged in ClickList.","Ben Bienvenu","Understood, thanks for that. And then, second question on the private label business, that\u2019s been a big success factor for you. Rodney, you highlighted in some of your initial comments, the customer perception of the brands that you offer under your corporate brand. I\u2019m curious, as you think about the future opportunity, A, what is the magnitude of the opportunity as a percentage of sales; and then, B, how much capacities do you have for self manufacturing to deliver on that higher penetration opportunity?","Rodney McMullen","I\u2019ll give a little bit broader answer than just your question. First of all, we would talk about it in terms of our brands versus private label, because from -- and it\u2019s something that took us longer than it should have. But, if those brands, they are our brands and the customers tell us they love it and one of the things that we probably should have done years ago but we hadn\u2019t but we actually, was much more aggressive on hiring a third-party company to do a broad test taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other companies\u2019 private label programs. And we always thought we were good but we came out even significantly better than what we would have even thought. So, it really highlighted the progress that our team has been making on improving the innovation in our brands, the variety of offerings. If you look at Simple Truth, obviously five years ago it didn\u2019t exist; today, it continues to grow double digits.","So, when you look at overall, our customers tell us they love our brands. And we continue to even get more aggressive in terms of creating additional innovation, brands, offerings within, new flavors.","In terms of the potential, at this point, the only thing that I would say is it\u2019s -- would be massive. And one of the things that we did several years ago, we went to the outside and hired a new leader for that team and about half of our team is from the outside. And when you go and look at Europe, obviously, on the Our Brand product in Europe, the market shares there are significantly higher than the U.S. And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level.","In terms of our plant capacity, if you asked our manufacturing team, they would probably tell you they\u2019re at almost capacity. I\u2019ve always found and we\u2019ve always found that we always figure out ways to produce incremental product and do it very efficiently. So, in terms of capacity, it is one of the great things about knowing how to operate plants, we could easily expand capacity, either through process change or additional expanding plants, things like that, whether is needed.","Operator","Next we have a question from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Rodney, Walmart -- you guys called out your great digital sales growth. And one thing is, can we get digital as a percent of sales from you guys?","Rodney McMullen","Not at this point. I don\u2019t know, Mike, if you -- not at this point. As you know, we are continuing to provide a little bit more insight than before. But\u2026","Robby Ohmes","Okay. So, I will keep pushing on that but -- maybe in the future some time. But, so, I was going to ask, Walmart obviously is being really aggressive with the rollout of their version of ClickList. I was hoping you could maybe speak to us about where you are having crossover with them, sort of what the dynamic looks like? Because I think you two are being the most aggressive at going after this new way of grocery shopping. And then, the other question I had on competition. Aldi\u2019s been out there -- sorry, Lidl\u2019s been out there now a little bit longer than Amazon\u2019s owned Whole Foods. So, maybe you could kind of update us on what you are seeing there? Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","Yes, On the crossover with Walmart on digital, I actually don\u2019t know the answer to that. Mike, do you?","Mike Schlotman","I don\u2019t know how many we overlap with. I do know that the thing that customers really appreciate about our offering is the fact that most of our customers live within a mile or two of the store. They shop and they can go pick the ClickList offering. And so, it\u2019s extremely convenient for them to engage in that kind of an activity and often easy-in easy-out and not all of our competitors have that advantage.","Rodney McMullen","And it\u2019s incredibly easy to develop a shopping list with us, the work that our teams have done working with 84.51\u00b0. We do a lot of work on predicting what your shopping list will be, to make it really easy to do. The one insight that I can give you and we\u2019ll have to go back and look to see the overlap on Walmart is -- our success on ClickList is very consistent across the country. You don\u2019t see one place where it\u2019s 1% and somewhere else it\u2019s a 100% variance of success. It\u2019s pretty consistent.","On the Lidl, obviously, they continue to open stores. So far, what they\u2019ve done has been pretty consistent with what we expected. And obviously, you\u2019ve heard us talk about from a pricing standpoint, we won\u2019t lose on price; we\u2019re not trying to lead the market down on price, but we are not going to lose on price. The success so far in terms of being able to maintain our business and grow our business, we feel very good about the ability to compete against all the Lidl and anybody else. So, I wouldn\u2019t say there has been any surprises so far. Obviously, they are our great competitor but there is a lot of great competitors out there.","Robby Ohmes","And just last question, the lack of -- the move away from giving us long-term guidance, is the ramp up of ClickList a big piece of that, meaning does it really pressure store profitability in the short-term? Because you\u2019re having -- is that how we should think about it is ClickList is great, but in the short-term, it\u2019s a real pressure on margins?","Rodney McMullen","Well, as everybody on the call knows, we make our investment decisions in terms of what do we think is best for our business three to five years out and which intern means what\u2019s best for our shareholders three to five years out. There is no doubt that ClickList is a headwind on earnings currently and we\u2019ve even continued to accelerate the speed in which we put ClickList in. And so, it\u2019s incremental headwind. We feel very comfortable, when you look at it over a three to five-year period of time. Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList; our associates obviously in terms of being able to provide the service will be glad; and our shareholders will be glad. So, we can clearly see where we\u2019re -- there is a path where we\u2019re indifferent on whether somebody comes into the store or shops with us on ClickList. It\u2019s you have initial paying and that would be a -- of what caused to affect the long-term guidance perspective.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS.","Mark Carden","Hi. This is Mark Carden on from Michael Lasser today. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, you commented earlier that periods transitioning from deflation to inflation can lead to a challenging operating environment. So, given we saw food at home CPI turn inflationary again this quarter, can you comment on how the competitive environment has held up relative to your expectations? And by that, has it been different from past cycles or pretty much in line with what you\u2019ve seen recently?","Rodney McMullen","I would say it\u2019s fairly common or fairly traditional time of a transition. It\u2019s just at anytime you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disruptive is how quickly will people lower prices and then the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust prices the other direction, to continue to protect the gross margin dollars that they would have in those products. And that\u2019s what causes the disruption in the short run as you\u2019re cycling through the two of those. I would say broad based, there isn\u2019t anything that\u2019s really out of the realm of what you normally see. The one exception to that would be what we talked about earlier in the year relative to some low milk prices earlier in the year and eggs continue to be pretty inexpensive as well. But, those would probably be the only two categories that I would hold out as maybe exceptions to the norm right now.","Mark Carden","And then, I guess a little bit more near-term. You mentioned that with hurricanes is obviously some variability. One day you could see a benefit from stock up trips, when the next day see a decline from closed stores. I guess historically, have you seen this trend towards either a net benefit or a net loss or is it really just varies based on the storm?","Mike Schlotman","It really varies based on the storm. I would say, at the end of the day, there is probably -- it depends -- one, it depends how the insurance claim winds up getting reconcile. But from your business insight, the store, there is usually a slight benefit. One of the things we\u2019ve always done a great job at is being one of the first people fully back in business and being able to service our customers and the communities where we have our stores. And it\u2019s very important for those folks when -- as they\u2019ve been evacuated and the local authorities lift the evacuation order, we have to be back in business for them or they\u2019re going to have a really big problem when they let folks come back into their homes. Many of these folks have lost product in their homes and they have start back up once they can get back in their homes. So, there are just so many factors in it. But, first and foremost, we try to be in it for our associates, our customers and our communities because they do need food to eat, and we\u2019ve always been there to provide it for them.","Rodney McMullen","The other thing that we have such great relationships with local agencies, almost always we would be considered part of the first responder group, because people understand that it\u2019s important for the glossary stores to get stocks. So, our associates would be given clearance as a first responder in most cases.","Mike Schlotman","Once you to get to the store, often part of the first grids to come back on in power, there is a whole litany of things that before you come back from an evacuation, you have to get basic services up, you have to have food, and we typically always fall inside that and they are ready to help.","Operator","The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. ","Rupesh Parikh","So, I also just wanted to touch on may be some of the larger CPG players out there. We continue to see weakening trends from a number of larger players. And I was just curious, as you look at your partners just with them, are you all starting to see more efforts by them in terms of maybe supporting their products in store or maybe improving competitiveness?","Rodney McMullen","One CPGs, as you know, we always work with CPG partners, trying to understand how we grow our business on a combined basis. So, both of us are very focused on growing the business. I think CPGs continue to aggressively, incrementally try to work with us on helping grow their business. It\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s nice about having the great insight we have with 84.51\u00b0. We partner with most CPGs in a different and more deep way that also involves product innovation. So, there is no doubt, there is tremendous amount of change going on, the CPGs feel that change, and we\u2019re working with the CPGs for both of us to grow our business. But, obviously, we\u2019re also working and focusing on growing our business as well.","Rupesh Parikh","Okay, great. And then, going back to maybe a question that was asked earlier on the promotional environment. So, it sounds like some of the items that were more promotional, eggs and milk, you continue to see pockets of increased promotions out there. But outside of that, how would you characterize the promotional environment versus what you\u2019re seeing earlier this year?","Rodney McMullen","Outside of that, I really wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s -- there has been a massive trend change, what do they always say in economics, all short statements are wrong. So, you give the scenario and I can find it somewhere. The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country; everywhere else would be puts and takes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Sinisi","Just kind of go back a little bit more to the overall pricing strategy. Obviously kind of since last quarter, it\u2019s been a big topic for you guys. What is the 84.51\u00b0 data telling you? Like, when you\u2019re making decisions in different geographies to either be the leader or matcher or close follower on pricing on some of these high velocity items, is it kind of always the case that you kind of have to match it to keep that well customer or if they go somewhere else, how long does it take to get them back and maybe just a little bit around the consumer behavior that data is telling you?","Rodney McMullen","The biggest thing that the 84.51\u00b0 insight shows us is the customer decides where to shop based on their total experience. And obviously that total experience is what\u2019s the shopping environment like, so what\u2019s how the associates treat the customer. What kind of rewards do you have, what type of personalized offers are you making, which is very hard for anybody to see that other than each one of us as a customer individually. And then, obviously from fresh product standpoint having great produce, meat, deli, dinner tonight, these kind of things. So, the thing that\u2019s really important is the all of that together, the price, the specific price items, really each one of us would have different items that are in our biggest hot button. So, it would be factoring in all of those things in terms of how we decide where to price and how to price. And the insights, the biggest part of the insights is, it really is important to customers for their over total experience not just one dimension of the experience.","Vincent Sinisi","Okay. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up, just going back to the maintained EPS guidance for the year. It would seem that at least with 10 basis points lower margin, at least one of the large offsetting factors would be from fuels. Maybe just any thoughts on the profitability on fuel side for the back half of the year? And also just -- I don\u2019t know, I might have missed it, but can you give us some inflation number as well for this quarter? Thanks a lot. ","Mike Schlotman","What was the last part? You kind of\u2026","Vincent Sinisi","Yes, the inflation for the quarter.","Mike Schlotman","Yes. So for fuel, it continues to be a strong year in fuel. And I don\u2019t want to play the hurricane card again. But, obviously, refineries have been shut down. The Colonial Pipeline was shut down for a while. Supply has been tight in some places. So, there will probably be some disruptions overall in the third quarter. We haul fuel from a lot of distant places to get -- to keep a lot of our stores in fuel. So, I still think fuel has a relatively good back half of the year. Relative to inflation, I ticked off the categories that saw some inflation and deflation. We did have inflation for the first time ever in the grocery category. It was -- probably it was 48 or 49 basis points of inflation, which is the biggest driver of where the overall business winds up going. And that\u2019s the first time in -- my sheet goes all the way back to third quarter of 2014 in the grocery category on a quarterly basis, that\u2019s the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014 that we had any inflation in the grocery category.","Operator","The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Tanal","Just to better understand the reduction in the non-fuel operating margin guidance. Is that more about gross margin or operating expenses versus sort of the initial thought process?","Mike Schlotman","What was your comment on the guidance of reducing the non-fuel operating margin?","Stephen Tanal","Yes. Is the reduction more about gross margin being a little worse than initially thought or operating expenses being a bit higher?","Mike Schlotman","I don\u2019t know that we gave -- I am unfamiliar with us having given guidance on operating margin for the back half of the year.","Oh, it\u2019s in the 8-K. Okay, I got you. I was going to say, we didn\u2019t talk about it in -- on the call. It\u2019s the continuation of what we\u2019ve seen. We do think from a dollar standpoint that we are going to continue -- that we\u2019ll start to see some strengthening of gross profit dollars and operating profit margin dollars as we go throughout the year, as ID sales continue to get stronger that will grow the dollars which is obviously the most important thing to grow earnings per share by. And at the end of the day, we focus on the dollars, not the rate.","Stephen Tanal","Okay. Fair enough. And just to follow up on the milk and eggs comment. I think you might have mentioned, just now sort of across the country, and I don\u2019t know that that was consistent with sort the last time I heard about that. Has it broadened out, did I catch that right? And pursuant to that, the price investments that you guys announced last quarter, do you feel like still they\u2019re really sufficient?","Rodney McMullen","Yes. On the milk and eggs, I just -- I didn\u2019t -- the comment I made, I didn\u2019t intend to infer that it changed anything from the first quarter in terms of broadening out or narrowing or anything on milk and eggs. What was the second part of your question?","Stephen Tanal","Second part is just around the price investments in this category. Do you still feel pretty good about that or what you\u2019ve done already, is that sufficient at this stage based on the geographies where you\u2019re seeing that pressure?","Rodney McMullen","Well, I guess, I would broaden it. We feel good about the pricing investments that we make and based on what the customers\u2019 telling us, it continues to connect as we expected. And it\u2019s -- we feel good about it when you look at everything in total.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. And just a last one, just on the inflation comment. Was that specific to groceries or the center store or was that kind of all-in applicable to IDs? And if not, could you give us sort of an all-in number?","Mike Schlotman","The all-in number was ID sales without inflation -- without the pharmacy business was about 60 basis points with inflation, so not a whole lot different than the grocery category.","Operator","And the next question comes from Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank.","Shane Higgins","Hey. Good morning. So, non-fuel FIFO gross margin excluding ModernHEALTH were down about 30 basis points. That was pretty good improvement versus the first quarter. Could you guys just walk us through some of the puts and takes of that decline? And is that more reflective of some moderation to price investments, is it private label mix? Just any color there would be great.","Mike Schlotman","I would say there would be two things that helped that, and one is the continued strength in growth of our brands, which while it dampens the top-line a little bit, comes at a better gross margin rate. And the second is as we continue to do great job on cost of goods and the input cost of that. And one of the things the CPGs partners like about the cost of goods investments is we do pass those on to the customers but it does help strengthen the gross profit rate in dollars over time when you have the better cost of goods that are out there.","Rodney McMullen","Also in some of the costs -- operating costs categories, the second quarter trends improved versus the first quarter as well.","Shane Higgins","And should we expect that to continue into the third quarter, that trend?","Mike Schlotman","I would think so.","Shane Higgins","And just a quick follow-up, just, I had a bigger picture question on just -- obviously the retail environment has been pretty challenging over the past year or two. Do you guys anticipate any kind of acceleration in store closures from weaker competitors over the next year or two years? Not sure how much visibility you guys have into that. But, if so, would you guys be prepared to maybe purchase any of these assets or locations similar to what you did with Marsh? And how does your decision to pare back CapEx kind of play into that dynamic if at all? Thanks.","Rodney McMullen","We feel very strongly that we would expect additional consolidation going forward and the consolidation will happen the way you describe, plus other ways in terms of companies merging and other thing. So, we don\u2019t think there is any doubt that you\u2019ll continue to see a lot of consolidation. You\u2019ve always heard us talk about -- anything that happens, you should assume that we\u2019ve looked at it. And if you look at what we did with Marsh, obviously those work out really well for us, because of specific trade areas that we haven\u2019t been able to get into. And by buying some stores from somebody in that situation, you\u2019re able to get into trade areas and leverage all your existing infrastructure. Those we always like, but they\u2019re lumpy. So, you won\u2019t have any for a couple of years and then you\u2019ll have a whole bunch of them happen. But, those are once that we will always be interested in and always take a look at. But, you should assume that our overall view on the merging with somebody is the same and we continue to look at stuff.","Operator","Okay. The final question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Concepcion","Just curious about your natural and organic portfolio. The growth rate you\u2019re seeing there, what portion of your business it now represents? And related to that, what is your private label penetration in natural and organic?","Rodney McMullen","If you look at natural and organic overall, it\u2019s over $16 billion business for us on an annual basis. So, obviously, it\u2019s an important part of our business. It continues to grow strongly and we would continue to see a great opportunity in that space. We find more and more customers. For some items, they will purchase natural organic items and other places, they will buy traditional items. And for us, what we try to do is, we don\u2019t judge a customer on how they eat, and we try to make sure we have what the customer wants at a great value. In terms of the share of market, it depends on how you define share of market. If you look at Simple Truth, last year it was about a 1.7 billion category for us. And if you look at the $16 billion in total that would obviously include some non-branded meat items and other items. So, that would give you some insight in terms of share of market. If you look at grocery overall, grocery typically on units is close to 30%. So, obviously, there is still a lot of room to grow.","Alvin Concepcion","And my follow-up is just on click and collect. Just curious, what kind of penetration you\u2019ve seen in stores that have had it longer, where you think that can go and also how do visits and basket compared to an in-store customer?","Rodney McMullen","When you look at total, we get more of the customers business and that\u2019s what we find the reason why we are so supportive and keep working on it. In terms of the share of business, at this point, we wouldn\u2019t give the specifics on stores and what percentage of their business is in ClickList. It\u2019s a reasonably wide range. And the range isn\u2019t driven by anything that -- it\u2019s more specific stores. So, I know one store that has a pretty high percentage, it\u2019s right off the interstate, so that store has gained a lot of new customers because it\u2019s easy on and easy off, the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store.","For us, what we\u2019ve tried to design is a business model that we know at certain percentage of business it\u2019s more efficient to do it in store because of not having incremental asset investment. At the point in time that it grows, it\u2019s easily converted to dark stores or a freestanding warehouse facility where you put in more automation. So, what we\u2019ve tried to do is design where we can support and partner and make money and the customers will take it to whatever percentage of our business they take it and we\u2019ll be there for them as they go. So, we\u2019ve really worked hard on having a model that\u2019s easily scalable and scalable in terms of what percent of penetration it becomes. So, thanks Alvin. Anything else?","Alvin Concepcion","That\u2019s all. Thank you.","Rodney McMullen","Okay. Thanks, Alvin. Thanks to everyone on the call. Obviously -- hopefully you hear some of the comments that Mike and I are making, Kroger is playing to win. And the things that we do are what we believe will be best when you look out three to five years for our customers and associates. And what we\u2019ve always found, when we do both of those, then, our shareholders are well rewarded as well. And the business continues to generate great free cash flow and we have great opportunities in front of us. So, and then one other comment, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in.","First of all, I would like to send our well wishes to the people of Huston and especially members of our Kroger family whose lives have been turned upside down by the recent hurricane and its aftermath. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are now bracing for Hurricane Irma as well.","Since the rains stopped in Houston, you have shown nothing can stop the strength, resilience and power of our amazing associates. Many of you stayed in or couldn\u2019t easily leave stores, distribution centers, plants and offices and stayed overnight and worked tirelessly to not only serve our customers, but to provide food and supplies to first responders and local shelters. As a company we\u2019ve sent nearly 2,800 semis packed with food, water and other critical supplies to the region. More than 350 individual associates from all corners of the country traveled to Houston to lend their hands to help uplift the community.","Having a physical presence and truly being part of a community is always important. This is perhaps never more apparent than when natural disasters strike. You and our stores are a vital part of the communities we serve.","What I\u2019m most proud of is how you\u2019ve taken care of each other. Whether that\u2019s giving a hug to someone who needs it or traveling across the country to work side by side in reopening our stores and warehouse, we take care of each other, it\u2019s who we are. Each day we open our doors and welcome our neighbors with true hospitality and generosity, and together, we make the world a better place. Thank you for all you do in big ways and small ways to feed the human spirit. We are truly Kroger Strong.","That completes our call today. Thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12863":["The Kroger Co.

Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2015 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Kroger delivered strong first quarter sales and earnings results and we are pleased with our start for the year. We achieved our 46th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling four quarter basis, and we continue to invest and innovate to grow our business, expanding our use of technology and our digital capabilities.","Kroger has produced consistently remarkable results for so long that it might be easy to take a quarter like this for granted. But these results don't happen accidentally. They happen because we lead and drive our business towards these goals. Customer 1st and our four keys: our people, products, shopping experience and pricing, remains our fundamental strategy. We strive for balance across these four keys and each quarter we do a little better in each, and when we do that consistently for as long as we have, our results are more powerful.","Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are raising our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year and we are on track to deliver our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend in 2015.","One of the ways we continuously improve the shopping experience is by bringing new technology and digital capabilities to our business. Mike Ellis will provide an update on several digital efforts in a moment, but I wanted to mention what I think is a great example of how we're expanding our use of technology. Our recent decision to established 84.51\u00b0 which replaced our previous joint venture, dunnhumbyUSA, 84.51\u00b0 is helping us to continue to use data science for the benefit of our customers and to deliver a more personalized experience both in-store and online. We are so excited to welcome the talented associates at 84.51\u00b0 to the Kroger team and we are already beginning to see their daily involvement in the business helping to accelerate our efforts. Just little things like 84.51\u00b0CEO, Stuart Aitken, participating in our senior officer meetings is making a big difference. We expect 84.51\u00b0 to be an innovation engine and a game changer for Kroger and our customers.","We are pleased to see the economy moving in the right direction, albeit as we've mentioned for several quarters slowly. One of the important ways we are able to deliver so consistently is that we offer attractive values for all customers all the time. When you want to splurge, you can splurge. When you want to save, you can do that too. So while Murray's Cheese, Starbucks and Boar's Head, for example, are performing very well, so are our entry-level price point brands.","Now, I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. Our associates continue to deliver an exceptional experience in ways that make a difference for our customers. Over the past year, more customers have noticed improvements in Kroger's product selection, product freshness and customer service. Our strong identical supermarket sales growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the first quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at even a faster rate than total household growth again in the quarter.","We are especially proud of our loyalty and sales results when you consider the current operating environment that we're in, which has less certainty than normal. We are addressing the volatility we see out there every day. Fuel margins, for example, have returned to normal compared to where we ended last year. Another factor is product costs. Some commodities are up, some are down. We are seeing deflation in milk, produce and seafood which is driving more tonnage volume. Milk is one of our most price-elastic categories that we have. When milk prices come down, people tend to buy a lot more. We're at an advantage because we have a vertically integrated supply chain for milk. When our dairy plants run at higher volume, we become more efficient and productive. We continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals and in certain commodities in the meat department.","Overall, inflation continued but at a lower rate during the first quarter which is in line with what we had expected. Tonnage growth was very strong during the first quarter. In fact, we saw the strongest first quarter tonnage performance since 2010 which is a clear indication of our ability to get pricing right for our customers. If you look back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation and we've shown that regardless of the environment we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers.","Corporate Brands had a solid first quarter accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.9% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation and, as Rodney said, we are actively expanding Kroger's use of technology which we see as a catalyst for improving our connection with customers and growing our market share.","Kroger's digital team has developed a popular mobile app that our customers use millions of times each week. In April, we were one of the first food group retailers to release an app that is compatible with the Apple Watch and this month we reached a new milestone, more than 2 billion digital coupons have been downloaded from our digital properties since we began offering digital coupons since 2009. It took four years to reach our first billion and only 15 months to reach our second billion and the third billion will take even less time.","Also this month, our Cincinnati division began inviting local customers to try our order online, pick up in store solution we are learning from Harris Teeter which we've been beta testing for a few months and is now available in two of our Cincinnati area stores to all customers.","Our integration with Vitacost.com continues to go very well and just this week, Vitacost helped us launch a new natural and organic e-commerce website called King Soopers Live Naturally that is open to King Soopers customers who live in and around the Denver metro area. The website, which utilizes Vitacost's technology platform and fulfillment network, creates an endless aisle experience with ship-to-home service for thousands of additional health foods, vitamins, minerals and supplements that are available in our Denver area stores today. We are excited to see the results of this new pilot program.","And now, I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Las Vegas and Louisville, and we agreed to a master agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Four or five Teamster locals have also ratified this agreement. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus, Denver, Memphis, and Portland.","Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective: growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Before I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to say a little more about the culture of opportunity we work hard to create here at Kroger. Being a Kroger associate means being part of our family, part of something bigger. Every day we hire people who come to Kroger for a job, then decide to stay for a career. In fact, two-thirds of our store managers today started as an hourly clerk stocking shelves or bagging groceries. We continue to increase our investment in training to build skills so our associates are ready for opportunities to advance and lead others. We offer so much more than a job, a chance to connect with their community, to be part of a giant team stretching from coast to coast, and to work with colleagues who want to make a difference too. We think this opportunity culture is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be into the future.","Now, Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2015. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.","Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We were pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 5.7%. This strong performance was supported by identical supermarket sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong identical supermarket sales growth.","Rolling four quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items, and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 increased by 10 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling four-quarter basis.","Return on invested capital on a rolling four quarters basis was 14.03%. We are not presenting the comparative number this quarter because the prior-year first quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We do expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from the fiscal 2014 result. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.","Now I'll share our first quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictability of fuel margins on our results. Total sales in the first quarter increased 0.3% to $33.1 billion compared to $33 billion for the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6.4% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year.","In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $619 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Kroger's net earnings during the first quarter last year included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effect of those charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings in the same period last year were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share.","We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the first quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year. We raised our annual estimate to $90 million from $75 million, primarily due to pharmacy inflation. FIFO gross margin excluding retail fuel operations decreased seven basis points from the same period last year.","Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, decreased 15 basis points as a result of sales compared to the prior year. This really does demonstrate the leverage of strong ID sales as we simultaneously invested in areas other than price to provide a continually improving shopping experience for our customers, but leveraged our ID sales to drive the rate down.","Now for retail fuel operations, in the first quarter our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.131 in the same quarter last year.","Our long-term financial strategy continues to be: repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 8 million common shares for a total investment of $585 million. Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities totaled $915 million for the first quarter compared to $709 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year.","Our plan to increase capital investment on an annual basis remains in place. We were pleased with the early returns from these investments and we continue to have a long list of strong projects that will compete for these investments.","The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.09 compared to 2.40 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion, consistent with last year. It's constructive to understand that we have maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last four quarters and investing $3 billion in capital on a rolling four-quarter basis, plus an additional $411 million on mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and our shareholders.","Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2015. The original guidance was 3% to 4%. We are confirming our net earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share for 2015. This range is within our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time.","As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe that quarter two will be slightly above the range, quarter three will be at the high end of the range, and quarter four will be below the range. For the full year, we expect to be within the range and it is still somewhat dependent on where fuel margins shake out.","Now, I will turn it back to Rodney.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike. This is another terrific quarter. Our associates are making a difference for our customers by providing excellent service and product quality and selection. As I said earlier, results like this don't happen by accident. We create these results by connecting with our customers through our powerful Customer 1st strategy. When we take care of our customers, we create sustainable value for our shareholders.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys, and nice quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Good morning too.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So my first question I guess is just related to the guidance, so I guess maybe more for Mike. But obviously you raised your ID guidance for the year. You had a good strong quarter but you maintained the EPS guidance. So I'm just curious at this point is it just early and you want to be conservative or are there other incremental offsets that are maybe new?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a variety of factors, Ed. One, it is early in the year. And as we said in both the release and in the prepared comments, the operating environment is a bit volatile right now. There's a lot of volatility in fuel prices. They've obviously come in very quickly to a more normal range from where the range was at the end of the year last year. We know that will be a headwind in the fourth quarter. It was baked into our original 8% to 11%. Our actual first quarter results, while ahead of the Street, were just a little bit over the 8% to 11% range and we had expected to be near the high end of the range ourselves, which was our original guidance on cadence.","And then just the volatility of inflation that's out there, while we've seen some categories with deflation, we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it's been over the last several years in the first quarter. It's right at double digits. And then a little bit of concern or thought process about the avian virus with the poultry flocks and how that might affect input costs later in the year and what's going to happen with availability of those products.","So when we stepped back and thought about it, while we're pleased with the first quarter, we thought the most prudent move given the uncertainty or the volatility of some of the things out there was to maintain our guidance range. We had guided in March that if fuel margins came in, it may put us at the low end. We aren't saying we're going to be at the low end but we're maintaining the range because that actually has happened with fuel.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And, Mike, historically you've said about $0.14 or so a gallon in fuel. Obviously, this quarter is lower but the slope of the curve was rising. Is there anything else that's changed in the marketplace or maybe it's become a bit more competitive where you're a little concerned about the $0.14?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I wouldn't say we focus on any one number. Our practice on fuel is to follow the market and then give our most loyal customers a really good value on fuel by our fuel rewards program, which I'll remind everybody, the cost of that reduces our ID sales. It doesn't reduce the fuel margin. And it's really just what's happening in the marketplace as we follow the marketplace and stay right on the Street price and the signs but then give that incremental reward. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the first quarter. Any short period of time in fuel is an interesting result but a longer period of time is what's more important.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Internally, we usually use a rolling four quarter number. This year, we didn't just because of how strong fuel margins were in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And as Mike mentioned, on a daily basis, we're probably never right but usually over the year, it gets pretty close.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, guys.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","The next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I want to follow up a little more just on inflation. For this upcoming year, have you guys changed your inflation forecast?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're still expecting it to be in the 1% to 2% range. We're actually at the high end of that range in the first quarter, a lot of that driven by the pharmaceutical inflation that Mike mentioned or we mentioned in the prepared comments, primarily in the generic arena. So that's out there. We do expect to see some potential inflation out there in the poultry flocks as the avian flu issue hits. We don't know what's going to happen with all of the input ingredients that go into products from liquid eggs and how that might affect a lot of products that contain as an ingredient. So we think 1% to 2% is right. So far that's what we're seeing.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks for the color. And then switching topics maybe to competition. We hear a lot about capacity growth in the specialty grocery arena, even I guess more commentary out there on the hard discount channel. What are you seeing right now from competitor openings in \u2013 I guess from a full service grocery perspective?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","From a full service, I guess I would say it's probably been pretty consistent over the last three or four years. Certainly not aggressive; certainly if you look at the niche merchants, there would be much higher growth there, but we consider everybody a competitor, so we wouldn't segment it as different as what probably most people would think we would.","Rupesh D. Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right, thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rupesh.","Operator","The next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking my question.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So I'm just curious on \u2013 maybe this is just semantics, Mike, and maybe I'm over-reading, but just to clarify on your guidance by quarter, you've said just now that 3Q, you expect it to be at the high end of your guidance. I think last quarter you said it would be slightly above.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If you look at second quarter and third quarter, actually I think second quarter we said at the high-end and third quarter above. We just flip-flopped those a little bit. It takes $8 million flipping between quarters to do that, and it's just our best thinking today. So it doesn't affect the year. I think if you look back to what we just said in March, the guidance on those two quarters is flipped between quarters, still reflects a very strong year.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And then on tonnage, I don't know if you guys would be willing to give an actual percent tonnage number. And then I guess following on that, I guess when I look at O&A, your O&A growth rates definitely seemed higher than what I would've expected. I know in the past you've talked about tonnage impacting that number, but maybe just some color on those too?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Relative to tonnage, we won't give an actual number. As Mike said in his prepared comments, it was the strongest we've had since 2010 and we haven't given a specific number, but we're very pleased with where it is. If you think about in the comments I made on OG&A, we're very pleased with the leverage we've got of 15 basis point reduction in that as a rate of sales. We did make conscious decisions to invest in other keys of our four-key strategy versus price to provide a better shopping experience to our customer, both through making sure the products are on the shelves in a timely basis, having our associates friendly and we keep our products as fresh as possible. So there was some conscious decision to invest in incremental services for our customers, which provides more jobs and hours for our associates as well.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The other thing on tonnage, we always try to give an outline of where we are and how it feels, but it's very hard to calculate and when a customer buys a 24-unit of something versus a 12-unit of something, internally we count that as one and one.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Or water, the common package for bottled water today is 32 bottles; it used to be 24. That's still a unit.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's not that we're trying to avoid the question; it's just that it's very \u2013 there's an awful lot of assumptions behind that and what we try to do is give everybody a general feel for what's going on.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the CLICKLIST I guess in Cincinnati, I mean, obviously, I know you guys are always very conservative and want to make sure your customer is getting the best experience, but it definitely seemed like it was a pretty long test phase, so I guess maybe, can you maybe clarify or give some color on what you ironed out and what made you feel comfortable to roll it out now? And how quickly you think you could accelerate that?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The length of the test would seem long just because it became public a lot faster than we had intended to because somehow, one of the newspaper folks that follow us found the actual website that we were testing with our associates. So it's not that it was longer than normal, it's just that it was public longer than what we'd normally would. It's tracking \u2013 if you look at our original plan, we're tracking on exactly where we thought we would be on the original plan and feel good about it. And Mike just pointed out to me we just added our second store, I guess, it was this week or last week.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And again, that's in a beta test and we kind of have to know it's there. It's a new experience for us and we just want to make sure it's right.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, Great. Thanks.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions and congrats on a nice first quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask you, first, about really the private label, in particular, the Simple Truth. If you could just give us a quick update in terms of where that brand is today, if over the first quarter there have been any updates in terms of product expansion and how big that particular segment is for you right now?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The brand we're very pleased with. I think you'll find around 2,600 SKUs in our stores today and talk about connecting with the customer in a meaningful way. They have taken the brand and really embraced the brand. For us, it's been not only strategic but it's really lining up with what customers are looking for today and you can also buy it now on Vitacost.com and it's available there also so anybody who, even if you don't shop in a Kroger market, you're able to get the product today. But now, we've been totally \u2013 completely pleased with the progress we're making and there are many more new items to come.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up sticking with the natural segment, as you're continuing to learn the Vitacost division and as you mentioned, you have the super site now up, have you had any further progress? I know it's still admittedly pretty early but have you had any further progress that you could share with us in terms of maybe bringing some more of those products that have historically been Vitacost into some of your other banners?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Today we have a pretty good selection of natural foods, supplements, bodybuilding products, healthcare products in our stores. Vitacost really just helps us fulfill that long tail of items that are smaller in some cases and on the King Soopers website now, you can pick up 25,000 to 30,000 additional SKUs than what you'd find in a typical Kroger store. So it's really helped us take Natural Foods, natural products to the customer in a much broader way. We're really pleased with where we're headed. There's a lot of work still to do. We're approaching our first anniversary of Vitacost next month and so we're actually moving pretty fast as a company and we're pleased with where we're headed.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, Rodney, I want to start with \u2013 you put up a quarter like this but I know you guys can be somewhat self-critical. When you step back and say from a skill set standpoint or a business line standpoint, where are you still not where you want to be in a significant way, not we're 90% of the way there but have a lot of work to do? And then as part of that, address maybe the issue of speed to market, and that being a more important skill set to work on over the next couple of years.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The shortest hard question to answer. When I did my own performance review with our board somebody asked me the same question. And you've followed Kroger for a long time and you realize when you look at our culture overall, we're always very proud of what we've accomplished. But at the same time, we feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to get better, and a lot of times we like to use the words that our to-do list is longer than our done list. And when you look at what's out in front of us, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we see to continue to get better. And the hardest thing that we have to do is actually make sure that we're trying not to improve on all things at once, but what are the things that are most important to the customer and put all our resources against that.","So I guess the way I would say overall is, obviously, we're delighted with the quarter, delighted with the progress we're making. We're even more excited about the opportunity to continue to get better. So I feel very good about where we are, but I feel even better about the opportunities we have in front of us.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","But are there certain \u2013 there have to be, right, certain product categories. I don't want to get into geographic differences, but certain product categories, businesses, customer groups that you're not fully resonating with yet, and they have to be those. What would tie those together, if anything?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's probably \u2013 I'm trying to think of the easiest way to answer your question because it's a very good question. It's more opportunity, so if you think about like apparel, we've added apparel, I think we're up to 70-some Marketplace stores. We're still learning what is the right selection of product to have that's in a Marketplace store. Obviously, the Fred Meyer group helps us get insight and procures the product for us through that channel, but we're still learning what's the right things to put in. And there's a ton of those things going on, so it's really hard to say there's one specific item or one specific customer. It's much broader than that, and it's 100 different things versus just one thing that we're really trying to get better at.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then just lastly, when you think about pricing and pricing being a journey, it looks to me like whether it's traditional competitors or mass, there has been some stabilization with regard to pricing. It's not a race to the bottom. Is that fair, and at this point, you're largely where you need to be. And the adjustments to come, do you think it's more rifled? Do you look at maybe the hard discounters and work to be done on private label pricing? But are we stable and largely there and just selective guys you've got to address at this point?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at longer term on pricing, as you know, over the last several years we've invested in price as we reduced OG&A to take costs out of the business. The last few quarters, we have been a little more aggressive in investing in service, so it's not just price-based. So if you look at the mix of where we invest, we have invested some of that cost reduction in additional service hours and things like that. So it's a journey that you never arrive at a destination, so you're continually making progress and you continually change based on your competitive made \u2013 competitors change as well. So we're happy where we are but we are continuing to invest, but it's really driven by as we get costs out of the business. I don't know if, Mike, anything you would want to add to that?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I absolutely agree. It's right in sync with the prepared remarks we had. When you think about our four keys, we're constantly asking ourselves what do we invest in to make sure that we're offering the best balance to the customer based on what the customer wants and the retail environment that we're in. So Rodney's point about investing more in our people in the last few quarters is right on.","John Edward Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","The next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, good morning.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. One question would just be real quickly, you talked about what your guidance for inflation was for the year. But did you comment on what you thought inflation was for the quarter?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We did not, but, Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We're at the high end of that range...","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","... primarily driven by pharmacy. It's about one-eighth.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","If you look at it without pharmacy, it would have been lower. And the comments we had on a volatile operating environment, if you just get rid of the headline news on inflation and you start to dig into the commodities, you have things going all over the world. And one of the things I think we're most proud of this quarter is there were so many things bouncing around, and our ability to manage through that this quarter really showed up in our results.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then I was wondering if you would talk at all about the formats that you're testing called Ruler. I think you maybe have about 30 stores. And I was just wondering what your thoughts are. And we do know that ALDI is going to be opening more stores in Southern California. It's getting a big push and Lidl is also going to be coming to the U.S. pretty soon. Just how do you feel about that format, and do you want to be a competitor in that format?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's still very early and it's obviously a test for us. It's one of the things we feel good about the progress the team made. The format actually came to us through one of our mergers. When we merged with Jay C, they had the format even back then. And the team has made a lot of changes to what's inside of it, and we continue to make changes. I wouldn't say that we're ready for primetime yet, but we are making progress in the right direction.","And it really ties back to when you look at \u2013 you've heard us over the years talking a lot about how customers are bifurcating and we want to make sure that we have a format that serves all customers. And there are certain customers that living on a budget is really important because either they want to or they have to, and it's operating a store as efficient as you can to give the best prices you can. So it really ties to that. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that?","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","Just what we learned from this type of format has really been helpful to better understand that value segment and how to operate in that value world, so we've really as a company learned a lot, I think.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just real quickly, I know you said your Natural Organic department was up double digits. Did you see any changes at all? I think there are some other retailers that have said there was a bit of a slowdown, I think, primarily in the dry grocery side, but I don't know. It doesn't sound like you saw anything, but did you?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Nothing that I can put my finger on it. It's still real healthy for us. Again, we have good supply, so we haven't had any issues around that. But no, customers still are as interested in the natural category, the Natural Foods world, real food, we call it, as they ever have been.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you for your answers.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Meredith.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on your thinking around the guidance. I think you said the quarter came in slightly above, with fuel slightly below. So how does that \u2013 if we just isolate the stores, does that mean the stores was a little better than that versus internal expectation?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the strong IDs without fuel would demonstrate how happy we are with our core grocery performance, and that's built into our expectations for the year when we raised ID sales guidance without fuel. So we're very pleased with what's going on inside the four walls of the store.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. And Meredith asked about, I guess, the cadence on natural, but I'd like to ask about it just across the store. It sounds like from your answer and the answer on natural that there hasn't been a big falloff of some volatility on the consumer side. I think it sounds to me like the worry is more on the supply side whether it's the fuel margins coming in or what's going to happen with some of the commodities.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question on the supply side, Andrew.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Well, first of all, I want to ask if you're seeing any change in your sales cadence and is that where you're seeing volatility? Or is it just the other things you mentioned such as fuel margins and potential disruptions, or whatever you're thinking about with avian flu?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll answer part of it. I'll let Mike or Mike answer the other part. If you look at the change during the quarter would be more driven by inflation, clearly. End of the quarter is slower than it started out in the quarter, so the change has been more inflation driven. Tonnage has been pretty consistent, or was pretty consistent. If you look at this quarter, quarter to date, we would still be slightly ahead of the range that we gave for the balance of the year and part of the reason for that is we expect inflation to continue to get lower as we go through the year. In terms of the avian flu and some of the other pieces, Mike...","Michael L. Ellis - President & Chief Operating Officer","When we just \u2013 Andy, when we sat back and looked at all of the factors out there and the fact that even though on the calendar, we're almost halfway through the year but for Kroger we're only a quarter of the way through the year, we just thought it was very early to change our EPS guidance for the year given the volatility in a lot of commodities inside inflation, given what could be an unknown effect of the avian virus as we go throughout the year. Volatility in fuel, again, we're very happy with where we are and we think given the 8% to 11% growth rate off of a very strong last year being able to deliver in that range and continue to produce the results on the cadence we projected, we think, will result in a very fine year.","Andrew P. Wolf - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Andrew or Andy.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Not sure if you answered this yet. If you did, forgive me. But in terms of ID sales into 2Q, how are they progressing quarter to date, even if just on a qualitative basis? And are there any timing issues, any items we should be aware of as we model that near-term top-line?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, as I just mentioned, if you look at the identicals so far this quarter, we continue to be a little ahead of the range guidance we gave for the year. Part of that is driven because we believe inflation will continue to decline during the year and we would still expect that based on what we're seeing today when you look at the impact on identicals.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I did miss it when you just said that, I apologize.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No problem.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Broader question, we've seen quite a sudden market share shift in food retail in general away from specialty channels back toward, for lack of a better term, the Kroger's of the world, more traditional, I know you don't love that term, but more traditional grocers. I think the general thesis out there, which I agree with is that much of the shift is generated by you and some peers adding natural and organic products, but it seems like better-for-you isn't quite big enough to move the needle as much as what we've seen. So are there any other drivers that you are seeing out there that would sort of explain this kind of quick shift in consumer behavior or is it too vague and too hard to tell?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I'm not sure \u2013 I guess I'll speak for myself a little bit here. I'm not sure I 100% agree with your thesis when you look at some of the specialty retailers just because some of them have reported lower ID sales than what their trend has been, they continue to open stores, they have a little bit of cannibalization and a lot of them continue to post ID sales above what the market would be growing at. So I wouldn't subscribe to the theory that they're necessarily a sudden shift in market share away from them, it may be a slower growth in market share gain, but I wouldn't say it's a shift away from them.","We actually \u2013 we can't ask our customers where did you shop before when our IDs go up 5.1%, we believe we're taking share and more sales dollars from our customers from a wide variety of retailers and are happy to do that and that's really what we focus on. But I think our sales strengths comes from a broad base of folks including doing a better job of offering new and unique products that they may not be able to get somewhere else like Simple Truth. But I think I wouldn't \u2013 if I we're sitting in their chairs, I wouldn't necessarily be embarrassed by some of the recent results they've had.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I will answer your question a little different than how Mike did. If you look at the fresh side of our business, produce, meat and some of those departments, deli, we're having incredibly strong growth. Some of that is improving freshness, some of it is that customers wanting to eat products that's fresher and that is something that we have a huge competitive advantage versus a lot of our competitors because the variety that we offer, we offer it all plus we do still have some \u2013 there's certain products you just can't get an organic item or a natural item. So we're able to make your full shop with us. So it's really a position of strength for us and an opportunity for us to continue to deliver.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's a very interesting answer. Thank you very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","And our next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter, nice way to start the year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","There's been quite a few questions about the competitive environment but I'll tack on another one. Are you seeing anything different in the promotional environment as the quarter progressed or even over the last month?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we probably have seen different competitive pockets of activity around the country but that's not unusual. But as a company, we just tend to deal with that as things change and as our customers \u2013 try to meet our customers' needs in the most beneficial way to them. But there's nothing really specific that I can put my finger on. But again, there is promotional activity. When you have this broader geography as we have, you see just about everything throughout the course of time, so, yeah, nothing I can really put my finger on.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And I guess maybe more specifically are you seeing anything different on the margin environment for your natural and organic food part of the portfolio?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Nothing that I would say is worth reporting but most of what we see today is just this mainstreaming of natural and organics continues but I wouldn't say there's additional retail pressure on those categories of goods.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. And one more quick one for me. You talked a little bit about the growth in loyal households. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast that growth was and what kind of share of wallet you're getting now from those loyal customers?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I can say we're pleased with transactions and number of households and visits per household and spend per customer. So in general, it's very healthy for us right now. I really don't want to get too specific about any of the numbers, but overall, it's been a combination of those factors that have been driving our ID sales.","Alvin Caezar Concepcion - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi.","Filippe Marcel Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking my question here. Typically, you don't comment obviously on M&A activity, but I was wondering if you perhaps could opine a little bit on if there were to be a merger between Ahold and Delhaize, whether that would at all impact your competitive position in those markets where you do overlap with the two companies. Thanks very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're correct when you say we don't comment on mergers, so I won't talk about the particular specifics on the one you asked about. But anytime companies merge, it creates certain opportunities, and you try to make sure that you deal with the opportunities that are created. And different ones create different kinds of opportunities. And it really is, you sit down and say what is the right strategy for this particular one. And we wouldn't look at if the two of them merge any different than whenever somebody else merges. And we believe there will be continued consolidation in our industry, and we have every intention of being a consolidator in that consolidation of the industry. And as you know, we participated in several mergers over the last year and the last several years.","Filippe Marcel Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then if I perhaps may ask a derivative question, obviously, you've seen the news of CVS and Target working together right now for the operation of the pharmacy stores within the Target locations. I presume that Kroger remains fully committed to operating the respective pharmacy locations you have within your different formats yourselves going forward.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We love the pharmacy business and the whole offer that it offers for the customer, and we continue to see strong results there. One of the things that if you look at the average volume per location and some of that, we would have very, very strong performance on a per location basis and continue to do very well and grow. So we're making...","Filippe Marcel Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","Okay, thank you very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Filippe Marcel Goossens - Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc.","That's very helpful, thank you very much.","Operator","And next, we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Good morning. So, Rodney, you teed this up because you said you see yourself as a consolidator in the business. And so I know, Mike, I think you said your leverage is 2.09. Thinking about your balance sheet, what is your capacity to do further transactions?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the answer to that question isn't what my financial capacity is. It's what's the capacity of the organization to do something. It's what assets might be available and do they fit the metrics that we typically would go after when you would look at a transaction. So we wouldn't sit back and say Harris Teeter is behind us, we've delevered, let's go spend another $2.5 billion, get it back up to 2.4 and work our way back down. It's really quite the opposite.","It's one of the reasons we try to maintain the ratio where it is. If an opportunity does come up, can we take on the leverage of that correct unique opportunity, act on it, have the rating agencies continue to have the believability in us doing what we say, and that is we told them 18 months to 24 months we'd get our leverage back down? It took 12 months and it went down again this year, and I think the statistics we went through with the return of capital to shareholders as well as what we've invested back in the business, all told, when you add that up, it's about $4.5 billion we either returned or invested. And to maintain debt at a flat level really demonstrates the power of the cash that we can generate as a company.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, thanks. The second question is, and I know we touched on some of the natural and organic guys and other things, but I was just broadly looking at the space. You guys commented tonnage growth has accelerated. It seems to me that your market share gains are accelerating. Why, I guess, what's changing? Why is more market share accreting to Kroger at an accelerating rate? And does your outlook \u2013 forget gas and inflation, but just basically is the outlook over the next 12 to 24 months that this pattern is going to continue?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For us, the progress that we've made overall, we really would give our hats off to our associates. It's our associates interacting one on one every time and helping make the customer's experience a little bit better is what's driving the results, and it's our ability to support our associates to deliver great service. So I don't know that there's a big magic wand that we're waving. It really is 100 small things but doing each one of those things a little bit better. And our associates continue to improve our execution and giving us feedback so we can keep getting better and then using the insights we have working with 84.51\u00b0, and then now going forward, we'll be able to work with others broader than just 84.51\u00b0. So it's all of those things together that's supporting that.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","All right, and then if I could have one more.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Publix continues to encroach. How do you stop that and what do you think about that? And then thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We would say by Publix the way we would say about tons of competitors, Walmart, Costco, and on and on and on. They're a great competitor. We always learn a lot from them because they do a great job running their stores. And we don't look at it so much in terms of how do you stop a specific competitor. We're really focused on how do we make sure we keep getting better. And if they're successful in a market, they're successful at somebody else's expense, not us.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks. Thanks, Scott. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Sure, and that question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for s squeezing me in. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about 84.51\u00b0. I thought it was interesting that you \u2013 I think Rodney characterized it as a game changer. And I understand that the new structure allows you to work with outside data service providers in conjunction with 84.51\u00b0. But I was just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what are some of the priorities in terms of how you would like to expand the use of that business for Kroger.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How do I answer your question without competitors understanding exactly what we're trying to do? I can tell you I've had more dialogue and several of us have in terms of how do we better use the data we have for the benefit of our customers and to run our business better. And we've had more of those discussions in the last eight weeks than we had in the two years before that because we spent an awful lot of time talking about things other than Kroger. So to us and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are a lot of great people at 84.51\u00b0 that we're just so excited for them to be part of our family and I know they're so excited because they're going to be able to even help us accelerate what we're doing.","So it's really hard to say specifics other than I can tell you we have a huge list of things that we can use our data for, for the benefit of our customers and running our business better that for whatever reason we hadn't taken advantage of and we're going to figure out a way to prioritize that and figure out a way to take advantage of that and some of those cases will involve partnering with other companies other than just 84.51\u00b0.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's helpful. And any comments on what the strategy, or is there a strategy to grow the 84.51\u00b0 business with other retailers or clients, like Kroger, so the company can grow its own profitability and growth?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We really won't comment on that at this point.","Kelly A. Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kelly.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. We recently wrapped up our Red White & Barbecue celebration in stores across our company. A special thanks to each of you for making this exciting event possible, and I can tell you I personally ate way too much on the samples. Our customers loved kicking off the summer grilling season with fresh flavors and fun ideas to share with their family and friends.","I also want to thank you for helping show Kroger's gratitude to our active duty troops and our nation's 23 million veterans this summer. Through our partnership with the USO and the Honoring Our Heroes campaign, we hope to raise an additional $2 million for our military men and women. Together, Kroger's associates and customers have raised more than $11.9 million since 2010 to support USO programs. This represents the largest gift to the USO in its history. Visit the Honoring Our Heroes website for more information about how you can help. We also continue to hire our heroes.

After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen.","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Rebekah and good morning everyone. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge that the team here at Kroger realizes that we have our work cut out for us as the market points out this morning. We realize business transformations are hard, but I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments. We look forward to our time together to take your questions and try to better lay things out for you. ","Joining me on today's call are Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Gary Millerchip for the first time, Mike's successor who will become Kroger's CFO on April 4. As previously announced, Mike will continue to serve as EVP and a member of our senior team until the end of the year. We can't say enough how grateful the entire Kroger team is for Mike's service, leadership, and stewardship of the company for the last 34 years, especially during the last 19 as CFO. We are also incredibly fortunate to have Gary, whose deep finance and business background combined with his successful track record of creating shareholder value as a member of our senior officer team, makes him the right person to carry Kroger forward. This is especially true as Kroger transforms from grocer to growth company. ","I've talked before about the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant. This constant reinvention takes place at least every decade. Gary has been instrumental in helping us think through our transformation as part of Restock Kroger and beyond. He is uniquely positioned to be Kroger's Chief Financial Officer of the future, and as such will also help shape the future of our omnichannel experience and reporting. During today's call, Mike will provide the financial and operations recap for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, and Gary will outline Kroger's guidance for 2019.","In October 2017, we introduced Restock Kroger, our three-year plan to create shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. The plan has four main drivers; redefine the grocery experience, partner for customer value, develop talent, and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value. Specifically, we committed to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative Restock cash flow by the end of 2020.","I'm pleased to report that Kroger solidly delivered on our key year one Restock Kroger commitments. When you look at the full year, we delivered against our FIFO operating profit and our Restock cash flow goals which sets us up to reach our 2020 targets. We improved identical sales and delivered EPS near the high end of both our original and adjusted guidance range giving us both business momentum heading into 2019. And I'm especially proud that we achieved an unprecedented cost savings of more than $1 billion through process improvements in 2018. ","Restock Kroger is fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers, and infrastructure. We continue to make significant investments to build an omnichannel platform that will deliver customers anything, anytime, anywhere. At the end of 2018, 91% of Kroger households have access to pick up or delivery. By the end of 2019, with full integration of Kroger Ship into our ecosystem, we will reach 100% of America.","We are very pleased with the growth of digital sales at Kroger. In 2018, our digital sales run rate was about $5 billion. Going forward, we are trending towards a run rate of approximately $9 billion. Kroger also grew our brands to reach a record 30.5% unit share in the fourth quarter. We introduced a 1,022 new items in 2018, which helped drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands.","Simple Truth continued to lead the way with a 15.3% sales growth in 2018 making it a $2.3 billion brand. Kroger unveiled several transformative partnerships to create customer value in 2018. Home Chef continues to grow and shape today's meal solution space. In February, we announced Home Chef's expansion to 500 more locations and six new store divisions. Our pilots with Walgreens, Microsoft, and Nuro continue to generate great customer insights. The Nuro pilot in Scottsdale is nearly complete and we are planning to enter another market early this year.","We remain optimistic about all the ways our partnership with Ocado will set Kroger up for accelerated growth in the future. In February, we announced Florida and the mid Atlantic region is where we plan to build the next two Ocado sheds in addition to the first location planned for Southwest Ohio.","In 2018, we accelerated investments in associates and significantly improved employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. And we were thrilled to be recognized on Fortune magazine's Change The World 2018 list for using Kroger\u2019s scale for good, engaging our business to solve society's most complex issues through Kroger\u2019s Zero Hunger, Zero Waste social impact plan. This groundwork positions us to deliver on our 2020 Restock Kroger targets including financials and transform the company for long-term growth.","I want to take a few minutes to talk in more detail about our alternative businesses. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top and bottom lines. That's why in February we announced the appointment of Stuart Aitken to the newly created role of Senior Vice President, Alternative Business. In this new role, Stuart is assuming oversight for Kroger's successful existing alternative profit businesses including 84.51 in Kroger Personal Finance. Stuart will also lead the development of a full portfolio of alternative businesses to support the transformation of Kroger's business model and to better support our customers in supermarket business.","Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51, and Media all beat their operating profit targets for the year. This was very encouraging as these are the biggest line items in our alternative profit businesses. We used some of the excess profit to invest into other new alternative profit streams to begin seeding our margin-rich, asset-light businesses of the future.","In 2019 we expect 20% profit growth in our alternative businesses and we will also launched a few more new businesses that are both symbiotic to our core and deliver high margins. Plainly stated Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. We will grow market share by creating a virtuous cycle built on our grocery business. At the core is a winning combination of unmatched local presence coupled with a digital ecosystem that enables us to offer our customers anything, anytime, anywhere. We are enhancing the customer ecosystem with partnerships that are helping us to redefine the customer experience by building incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering, and an unprecedented convenience.","A constantly improving customer ecosystem generates traffic, customer data, and insights which then fuel the growth of adjacent alternative profit streams. We see tremendous potential in these asset light margin rich businesses built on the foundation of an omnichannel grocery experience. The profits generated by these businesses will create shareholder value and generate cash to invest in Kroger's core so we can further redefine the grocery customer experience. This is how Kroger's new growth model is a virtuous cycle.","Above all Restock Kroger positions Kroger to create long-term shareholder value. We have a clear path to achieve the 400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative Restock cash flow by the end of 2020. We finished 2018 with sales and business momentum. We expect earnings growth and an improving supermarket business in 2019. Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results, Mike. ","J. Mike Schlotman","Thanks Rodney and good morning everyone. Reflecting on Rodney's comments to start the call it's kind of surreal to know that this is my 77th and final earnings call as CFO. I'm thrilled to be transitioning the role to Gary who is a terrific partner and will be an excellent Chief Financial Officer. Looking at our results for 2018 I'm very proud of the entire team at Kroger for delivering on the key Restock Kroger commitments we made back in October of 2017. Planning the first year of a three year plan is always the toughest and most critical since everything that follows builds on the foundation that gets built. We feel great about the foundation we have build which sets us up to create shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments to grow the business. ","There were a variety of factors that affected fourth quarter on either the OG&A or gross profit line. As a result of better retention and higher average hourly rate our vacation accrual was a $0.02 headwind in the quarter and incentive pay because of achieving the ID sales we did and the EPS was a $0.06 headwind. Both of these affected OG&A. As I said, our incentive plan was primarily based on the grid of EPS and ID sales. As EPS got closer to the top end of the range we were incentivized to continue to make sustainable investments in our business to grow sales. Some of these investments were in our supply chain for both supermarket business as well as Kroger Ship. On a combined basis this was about $0.04 per share. These items affected gross profit. When you add these together it was about a $0.12 headwind to the fourth quarter, a lot of which is something that we're going to be able to build on for the future. ","Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.34 compared to $19.08 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.34 versus $2.46 in the same quarter last year which affected total revenue. For 2018 our cents per gallon fuel margin was $25.02 compared to $20.06 for the year before. The average retail price for fuel for 2018 was $2.66 compared to $2.36 in 2017. The solid investments that we've made in 2018 will help the supermarket business have a better 2019 overall. We do however expect fuel to deliver lower operating profit margin in 2019 compared to 2018.","Identical sales momentum continued into the fourth quarter where our ID sales result was about 10 basis points improvement over last year's fourth quarter. There's no doubt that weather events and the acceleration of SNAP disbursements helped ID sales results in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to distinguish between the two because they occurred at essential the same time. Combined snow and snap helped ID sales by 44 basis points in the quarter. We continue to feel good about our ability to meaningfully connect with customers who rely on SNAP to supplement their food purchases. ","While space optimization was a slight headwind versus a slight tailwind we expected, we saw a strong progress. Stores that have been open for 12 weeks and unaffected by new competitor had positive results in the quarter. And admittedly this is taking longer than we originally expected but we are pleased to see this resolved. In 2018 we completed the most disruptive of the remodels. As we go through 2019 the work will be more targeted and therefore less disruptive to our customers. All in all the time for space optimization is turning as we head into 2019. ","FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $621 million compared to $782 million in the same period last year without the 53rd week and in 2018 and 2017 adjustment items. For the full year FIFO operating profit was 2.84 billion compared to 3.13 billion in the same period last year without the 53rd week and the 2018 and 2017 adjustment items and excluding the convenience stores. This was above our goal for the year and as Gary will discuss in a few minutes we expect to grow again in 2019 and we remain committed to reaching our Restock Kroger goal in 2020. ","Kroger's financial strategy is to use its free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining its current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. The company actively balances the use of cash to achieve these goals. Over the last four quarters Kroger has used cash to invest a combined $589 million in Ocado Securities and Home Chef, contribute $185 million pretax to a company sponsored pension plan, repurchase 79 million common shares for $2 billion which includes 1.2 billion repurchased with after tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under an accelerated stock repurchase plan. ","We paid $437 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchase of lease facilities. We remain committed to generating the 6.5 billion of Restock cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger and in 2019 we delivered 1.9 billion. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52 week basis is 2.83. We intend to use our free cash flow to bring the leverage ratio back into the target range of 2.3 to 2.5 times. The company's intention is to not buy stock back until we get into that range as we did in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.","We're investing in incremental $500 million on our associates over the three years of Restock Kroger. This is happening in a variety of ways including investments and wages, training and development. In 2018 we made significant investments in wages and used tax reform dollars to invest in our educational systems program, Feed Your Future. We also increase the 401K match for non-union associates among other benefits aimed at an improved associate experience. This was in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance paying benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, clear opportunities, and training. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many competitors do not offer. ","Looking now at labor contracts we recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering Smiths in Albuquerque. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering the store associates, at King Soopers in Denver, Fred Meyer in Portland, Ralston in Southern California, and Kroger in Memphis. Looking ahead we have several major negotiations in 2019 including contracts for UFCW store associates in Seattle, Las Vegas, Indianapolis, Louisville. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient healthcare and pension cost which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. ","Before I hand it off, I want to reiterate again that the first year of a three plan year -- a three year plan is it's difficult to land the first year. But when you step back to review the full year we feel great about delivering on our financial commitments while continuing to make the investments that will position Kroger for growth in the future. This solid foundation sets us up to transform Kroger and to deliver in 2019 and 2020. And now I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss how we are building this momentum in 2019. Gary.","Gary Millerchip","Thanks Mike and good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to join the call today and more specifically speak to Kroger's upcoming year about what we are committing to and how it aligns with the Restock program. The 2019 identical sales growth excluding fuel we are targeting identical sales that range from 2% to 2.25%. We expect net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. The low end of our range is above the current consensus estimate for 2019.","Kroger's EPS growth is expected to come from FIFO operating profit growth in 2019 which positions us well to deliver the incremental 400 million in FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020 through Restock program.","I'd like to spend a few moments underscoring Kroger's future growth model because the clear path to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit includes alternative profit streams. And although these high margin and asset life businesses going to have a major impact on our top line in the near term, they play a significant role in helping us achieve bottom line growth.","I have made it a priority to join Mike and Rebekah already for several investor meetings. We as an Investor Relations team recognize and appreciate the request to better understand how to model alternative profit streams going forward. Please know that our finance team is spending time on this very topic including a review of industry best practices with the goal of providing more detail in the future.","In 2018 there were several Restock Kroger successes that have created tailwinds we believe will help us continue to grow sales and achieve incremental FIFO operating profit in 2019. We pulled forward price, digital and store investments in 2018 in part using tax reform dollars which will create tailwinds for sales and operating profit in 2019. We achieved significant cost savings in 2018 and have plans to accelerate this momentum in 2019. Our largest alternative businesses Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51 and Media all beat their operating profit targets in 2018 and our plans for continued growth. And while investing to build a seamless ecosystem remained a headwind to earnings in 2018, that dynamic is beginning to shift.","As Mike shared in his comments earlier fuel is expected to be a headwind in 2019 compared to last year. The strength of fuel margins in 2018 helped us make investments that set the supermarket business up well for 2019. But we do expect softer fuel results this year.","Looking at the cadence of EPS throughout the year we expect the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of 2018. The second and third quarters to be within our annual guidance range and the fourth quarter to be above the guidance range which will allow the full year to align within the range. We anticipate that momentum will build throughout the year and put Kroger in a position of strength going into 2020. We laid the foundation in 2018 which we will now building in 2019 to deliver our 2020 commitments. This includes Restock cash flow. We delivered what we expected in 2018 setting us up to meet our 6.5 billion cumulative Restock cash flow commitment by the end of 2020. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of lease facilities to range between 3 billion and 3.2 billion in 2019. This number will likely grow in future years as we announce Ocado shares. ","As Mike also shared earlier in the short-term our intention is to use free cash flow to bring our leverage ratio back into our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. AND finally we anticipate Kroger's 2019 tax rate to be approximately 22%.","Before I turn it back to Rodney let me say that I'm incredibly grateful to Mike who has put together a thoughtful week-by-week transition plan. He really has been the best partner I could ask for when transitioning to the role of Kroger's future CFO. Thank you Mike. I'm personally very energized to be in a sector that is transforming as quickly as grocery retail. The way we think about the fundamentals of retail is rapidly evolving which will make the next few years incredibly interesting for the financial stakeholders who follow this space. And now I will turn it back to Rodney. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you Gary. As America's grocer Kroger has the winning combination of local presence plus a digital ecosystem enhanced by strategic partnerships enabling us to offer our customers anything, anytime, anywhere. We are transforming from grocer to growth company by deploying our assets to serve even more customers and create margin rich alternative profit streams. We are well positioned to deliver on our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Now we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays.","Karen Short","Hey, thanks. So I guess the question I have and I know you try to encourage us not to look at your business in terms of the core and fuel and alternative profits, but you did kind of give us the slide at the Analyst Day with that depicted so it's hard not to look at your business this way, but when I look at the full year 2018 and I try to break out what the core business actually did, the decline was fairly significant, like I'm kind of backing into almost 30% decline in the quarter. And I guess can you help me understand what the components of that are that are maybe just transitory? And then the second part I would just ask is obviously we were trying to think of you in a way that you're thinking of yourselves meaning as a growth company, but you need stability in your core to have the credit in your valuation for being a growth company. So maybe a little color on how you can attain that I guess stability and\/or grow your core?","W. Rodney McMullen","I'll take that one Karen. Well obviously a lot of -- we have made a lot of investments in 2018 which affects a wide variety of different lines, and it's difficult to say obviously fuel had a good quarter and a good year. When you look at trying to back into the core, what do you do with digital which has been a headwind and we continue to invest in digital. If you don't back that headwind out and put that in the growing a new business category, yes that would drive the core down the way you do it. But if you look at the digital investments we've made along with the other investments we've made in the fourth quarter, I talked about, the new warehouses that we opened up to support our digital business. If you look at that all in the core, yes, the core declined. I won't go into a specific number, but it really is how you slice and dice all of this. All that said and I wouldn't necessarily discourage you from looking at the different pieces of the business because we do have to do a better job of helping you all understand and explain where the alternative profit streams are going to come from because some of them won't affect the top line, some of them will just be a profit, but when you're trying to transform the company and you have a first year of a plan, we take all of the pieces and all the available flows of profitability together and then decide how to invest them in which business which is what we did in 2018. ","J. Mike Schlotman","And with that said and Gary mentioned it, we will definitely do a better job helping you be able to see that insight because we certainly understand the question and it makes total sense. ","Karen Short","Okay, and I guess just a follow-up then, so if we look at the 3.5 billion for 2020, I mean you're looking at an EBIT growth of 17% which is not something I've ever seen any grocer do in a year but is there anything that has changed in terms of each of the streams versus where you're at on your Analyst Day in terms of the growth rate?","Gary Millerchip","Hi, this is Gary. I think we feel as I mentioned in the prepared comments we feel very good about the 2019 plans that we have for the business and kind of referring back to your question Karen that you asked and Mike answered, there's a lot of noise obviously in 2018 when you're going through a major year of transition, and we feel that as we head into the second year of the plan, as the pieces come together and we have the tailwinds from some of those investments that we made, we have a strong plan in place that we feel is going to make a difference to the way in which growth is occurring across the organization and where you'll see that in the results that we report out as we shared in the prepared comments. ","I do think that as we head through 2019 and we're building on the plans that we put in place through Restock Kroger, we expect to see the investments that we made in 2019 start to come out in -- sorry, 2018 come through in 2019. And we have a very clear plan of what we expect those benefits then to deliver in 2020. So, I think we appreciate Rodney's comment that we have to give you a clearer view into how all those pieces fit together, but I wouldn't say there's anything materially changed in the plan that we have for the three years and that we're not seeing all the pieces come together in largely the way that we expected. ","Karen Short","Okay, that's helpful, thank you. ","J. Mike Schlotman","Karen, one more thing I would add on the calculation of the decline, and you may have done this but I would remind you that last year had a 53rd week, and you need to take -- obviously take that out when you compare 2017 and 2018 and I think last year we said that the extra week was worth $0.09 or so. ","Karen Short","Yeah, no, no we backed everything out. ","J. Mike Schlotman","Because I wouldn't come up with a number anywhere near where you are.","Karen Short","Okay, maybe we can follow up on this. ","Operator","The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Yeah, hi guys, good morning. First thing I wanted to maybe just follow up on where Karen was going with this, I mean on the $400 million goal, if we just think about how you started year one which you say is on track but EBIT fell over $200 million, and it would've been down more if not for an epic fuel year. And the biggest decline was in Q4 even if you adjust for that extra week, and I know that you are reaffirming this target, but if you look at 2019 guidance it's got about $100 million improvement, and it does sound like and this is off of a big investment year, and it does sound like there are some things that should come back to you which implies a $550 million improvement in 2020. So why isn't there more progress I guess in 2019 given what you're going to lap, and then can you give us more comfort around how you see this growth in 2020, I mean obviously your stocks are down quite a bit today because I don't think the market's seeing progress, the market is kind of seeing the opposite. So if you could just help us to some extent here I think it would be good? ","J. Mike Schlotman","Ed a couple -- lot of thoughts there in your question. You know one of the one of the things I would point to relative to progress we're making is what Gary said in his prepared comments were if you look at operating profit guidance for next year it is above where the current consensus estimate is. So, in our mind that does demonstrate progress. When you talk about why wouldn't 2019 grow more given the investments we made in 2018, we are expecting a more usual year for fuel margins in 2019 versus 2018. We believe it would be -- it wouldn\u2019t be prudent to budget 2019 to replicate 2018 in fuel. So the core business and the alternative profit streams, digital not being as big of an investment. In fact, a little bit of a tailwind when you look at expected investments year-on-year. We first have to overcome in 2019 lower expected operating margin in fuel and then grow off of that. And as we've built the business plan with the 2 to 2.25 EBITDA or ID sales, that still gets us to an operating profit margin that's above Wall Street, and if you look at the high end of that range, it's essentially right at what Wall Street would be predicting for 2020.","W. Rodney McMullen","Ed, I mean we clearly understand your question and just in answer a little bit with what Mike and Gary was talking about, digital we do expect it to turn to tailwind versus a headwind. As you know we accelerated a lot of investments into 2018 that we expect those to pay off in 2019. Mike talked about some of those obviously space optimization is one of those. We continue to make great progress on taking cost out of the business. And when you look at all of those together then as Mike mentioned we also expect fuel to be a headwind when you look at next year total. So totally understand the question and when we look through in modeling all the pieces I do think it's important to note when you look at fourth quarter by itself the incremental $0.12 of charges that Mike talked about, most of which will not reoccur next year. Or if they do they'll be spread out throughout the year versus just in one quarter. ","Edward Kelly","Okay, and a quick follow-up on the gross margin. The gross margin is down 93 basis points, it was certainly surprising, I mean it does sound like there are some onetime things in here, but can you just give us a little bit more detail on what happened, what is mix by the way, and what did you do in supply chain and then how do we think about the gross margin in 2019 because it's hard to get to your EBIT guidance without I think anyway flat to positive FIFO gross margins ex-fuel? ","J. Mike Schlotman","Yeah, if you look at the fourth quarter decline about a third of it, maybe a little less than a third of it was from price investment, so kind of what we've been experiencing all year long. The other two thirds of it is a combination of start up costs for some new warehouses that negatively affected warehouse and transportation line, that expense line that's in the gross profit. As well as continued growth in primarily our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy team had a great year, very strong sales growth out of them. That is a high growth business that has as compared to our core business a dramatically lower gross margin rate. But because of the price of each one of those prescriptions is so high it generates very strong operating profit dollars in that business. So, those last two were about two thirds or so of the margin erosion and pricing was about a third.","Edward Kelly","And just for next year.","J. Mike Schlotman","I don't think I'm going to give guidance for OG&A and gross profit for next year. If you look at the ID sales, if you look at their earnings per share guidance and we gave you operating profit there are assumptions that you're going to have to make about where OG&A and gross profit are going to go next year. As Rodney said, some of those investments we made this year won't be as dramatic as next year. Things like digital not being a headwind and being a tailwind will help margins as well. So, we won't be opening new warehouses like we did in 2018 and those start up costs are what cost us on the margin line.","Edward Kelly","Okay, thanks guys. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, thanks Ed.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Heinbockle of Guggenheim Securities. ","John Heinbockel","Let me start, when you think about over the next couple of years the alternative profit stream impact on margin rate, EBIT margin rate right, is the greater impact going to be on the gross margin line or the expense ratio line? And then when you guys talk about ex-fuel margin does that include the alternative profit streams today and will it in the future or you'll break that out?","Gary Millerchip","On the first question as I alluded to we are doing a lot of work right now to really decide how we best can share that story with you. Because I think as we've mentioned in the past the alternative businesses that we talk about have grown up a little bit as a legacy over the way they would have been within the Kroger business prior to what it was in 2017, identifying this as a big strategic growth area for the company and how do we truly leverage all the data and the knowledge that we have about the customer to try those alternative businesses across Kroger Personal Finance, the Media business and some of the other areas that we shared at the Analyst Meeting. So right now it would be reporting a number of different areas of the business and what we really want to do is to make sure that we're very deliberate in identifying and helping you -- provide you with a clearer picture of how you could see that more clearly as the business continues to accelerate growth in 2019 and 2020. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And John if you look at the OG&A and the margin rates excluding fuel, it would include those businesses. We would have a really long list of things to pull out if we didn't do it any other way.","John Heinbockel","Alright, so then as a follow-up is it possible based on what you said Gary, is it possible that there will be an alternative profit stream segment because again it's getting so significant and so different in the core business it doesn\u2019t make sense to break out separately for all of them combined, revenue and EBIT, is that something you're thinking about or amenable to? And then the last thing if you think about the core business what comp do you think you need to actually grow EBIT in the core business, is it 2, is it given the cost pressures is it higher, is it 3, what do you think?","Gary Millerchip","Yeah, I think to the first part of the question we are not rolling anything out right now, we're not committing either to what the answer would look like. We really want to make sure that we're deliberate about thinking through the best approach to make sure that we manage this business effectively but also can clearly demonstrate and show the story of the value it is driving to the bottom line. But certainly committed to reaching some conclusions on that and being clear in 2019 about how to think about this either. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And certainly when you look at the longer term model 2% to 3% we would certainly agree with that and would see the same number. For the next couple of years that might be a little on the low end of that to drive earnings growth but overtime the sustainability of the model really needs 2% to 3% identical. I think it is important to note John that if you look at our productivity gains during the year not only from the great year we had from reducing our turnover which means we increased retention, as well as some operational efficiencies inside the store. Our productivity pretty much offset the higher investments we made in associates in the store.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And next we have a question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning. Just wanted to touch base on the top line, the IDs over the past year were more in 1.5 to 1.9 range, and just wanted to be just maybe help us better understand the expectations to see acceleration in the business. to kind of above to maybe just speak give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the stores that have gone through the optimization and we will start there? I have a follow-up, thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen","Love the question, look at the last part of your question on space optimization and as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks it certainly has been I think longer than we expected but for the stores that have opened, then opened or remodeled longer than 12 weeks we're finally starting to see where that positively adds to our identical. And so it's been slower than we expected but it's nice to finally see. So obviously that's a piece of but we also expect to continue to see improvements from the investments that we made in 2018. If you look at tonnage in 2018 was actually stronger than what the identical sales growth would be and we continue to see people trading off in products and in size of products as well. So when you look at the maturation of remodels that we've done, continuing to improve the way we've significantly improved in stocks and some of the core business pieces. And tying that all together with the investments we've made is what gives us confidence in the 2% to 2.25% that we shared. ","J. Mike Schlotman","One other thing I will add to that Rodney is when you look at quarter to date we are essentially right on top of where the fourth quarter was and the split between the core supermarket business and the alternative businesses is very similar to where the fourth quarter ended. I know there's a lot of rhetoric out there the pull forward of SNAP means we've started the year out more slowly. But we're essentially right on top of where the fourth quarter ended so far. We are in the first quarter now, it's a 16 week quarter, a long way to go but we are off to a start that helps us feel good about the guidance. ","W. Rodney McMullen","And Mike's point on SNAP definitely -- there were definitely a pull forward and when you look at SNAP by itself the first period of the year would be a headwind but if you look at other piece\u2026 ","J. Mike Schlotman","It would be a headwind but we've filled that headwind with other sales in the supermarkets. ","Gary Millerchip","Just maybe one another piece of color to add to, as you think about the journey from Restock Kroger in 2018 and a lot of initiatives that we landed during the year that created some of the noise that Mike referred to, but really should start to build tailwinds into 2019. Rodney you mentioned that the turning point from a profitability impact of digital but as we continue to grow digital sales at the rates that we're seeing on a much bigger number that continues to have a bigger influence as we head into the outer years of Restock Kroger on the ID sales performance of the business. And then the work that we did in 2018 to invest in our own brands and driving significantly high customer engagements and as customers continue to deepen their relationship with our own brands is an important piece of the I think the opportunity that we see in 2019. And then finally the merger with Home Chef and what we're doing to expand the fresh food experience in the store and the meal kits opportunity, obviously only came in part way through the year and represents another opportunity that we see to ready build momentum in 2019 from 2018. ","Paul Trussell","Thank you, that's helpful color and somewhat related, curious what you're seeing over the past few months and what you're forecasting ahead on the inflation front and if you could just kind of comment a bit more on how we should think about price points given the higher input costs, are you seeing price points go higher and also to what extent or how would you describe kind of the price environment out there, is the environment rational? Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen","I don't know if I'll get -- the environment to rational or irrational. This is a competitive industry, it has always been a competitive industry. And we always built a business plan assuming it's going to be a little more competitive versus less competitive and if we get surprised when it's not more competitive it winds up being the help. If you think about inflation just in the fourth quarter and you take out few in pharmacy, cost inflation was less than that, it was about 39 basis points. When you added the pharmacy it get kicked up to 1.08 basis points. For the year it is actually without pharmacy with slight deflation on the year from a cost basis which may not reconcile with everything you're hearing about cost increases coming through. Our team has done a phenomenal job of going after cost of good savings in a variety of ways and keep in mind the numbers I'm talking about is what we pay for products based on how many of those units we have this year and last year and the price this year and last year. So, we've done a great job of being able to offset some of those cost increases you hear about. ","Gary Millerchip","Yeah, the other thing that I would add and we've talked about this before but when you look at some of the companies they've raised prices more than what the true cost is. And it really helps that our own brands are so strong because what we find is when somebody does that they end up giving up market share. And they give up market share to our own brands and over time we make more profit on our brands than we do selling the national brand. Now we're going to always give the customer a choice and we want to earn whatever we get but if somebody is pushing costs through more they'll end up giving up share when they do that.","Paul Trussell","Thank you, best of luck. ","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. ","Chris Mandeville","Hey, good morning. Can we just start off again with 2019 guidance here, how much of this 100 million to 200 million EBIT growth is essentially going to be coming from your core grocery versus your alternative revenue streams and how are you thinking about the fuel margin in 2019? And then I suppose Mike, I can certainly understand that you don't want to go line for line on guidance but clearly the market is reacting to the negative 93 basis points gross margin results. So maybe just at the very least you could hold our hands a little bit going into the first half of the year on gross margins and how to think about that as alternative revenues become a greater component of your EBIT?","J. Mike Schlotman","Yeah, I understand your request to hold your hand a little bit but we're going to stick with the guidance we've given. And not get specific on gross margins and things like that. I would say a big chunk of the growth in operating profit margin for next year would be coming from the core business with ID sales like we talked about. We do expect as I said fuel to be a pretty dramatic headwind next year which leads us to the bottom line result of the guidance Gary talked about in his section.","Gary Millerchip","On fuel we would be pretty close to using our three year average on margin in terms of expectations of fuel. We do skew that a little bit to more recent times but it's pretty close to the three year average. On gross margin you should not expect a 93 basis point reduction in gross margin. ","J. Mike Schlotman","That I agree with. And if you look at the model overall as you know we've accelerated a lot of the investments and some of the things showing up in growth is just the way the accounting shows in terms of warehouse and transportation costs. So those types of things we would not expect that same headwind.","Chris Mandeville","Okay, so I suppose my quick follow-up to that just really is, we were expecting to see far less than 93 basis points in Q4 based on Q3 comments. So, just to be clear so long as we don't receive any type of material tailwind from fuel which we are very unlikely to receive in Q1 there should be some sequential improvement in your gross margin degradation, correct?","J. Mike Schlotman","Correct. ","Chris Mandeville","Okay, and then my follow up would be just I've spent quite a bit of time in Vegas this last couple days at Shop Talk and we've been speaking to a lot of folks within micro fulfillment. So Rodney I guess I just want to get your take here again as it relates to relationship with Ocado, can you can help us think about a few items here just why you think this is the right technology going forward, have you spoken to them with respect to their own micro fulfillment option now called Zoom and then maybe does that actually afford you some flexibility with respect to the 20 CFC that you dedicated yourself to with them?","W. Rodney McMullen","In terms of first of all somebody on the Ocado team and the Kroger team would actually be talking daily. Now if you look at a broader strategic conversation those would be happening probably on a monthly type basis. The thing -- one of the reasons that we were incredibly excited about partnering with Ocado is Tim and his team continually pushed themselves. And what they have today they'll continue to get better and they will continue to look at different approaches and alternatives. And when we signed the agreement with them one of the comments we made was that we're not signing it based on what you have today, we're signing it based on what we think you're going to have in three to five years because of the talent they have, their drives that keep getting better, and some of the things they have on the drawing board. So I feel very comfortable that if there's a model out there that's more efficient and gives the customer what they want, the partnership with Ocado we will be able to discover that and we will be there when it needs to be there as well.","Chris Mandeville","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. And then Mike gosh, it's been years so congratulations. I can't believe you're going to be not on the call. ","J. Mike Schlotman","Yeah, my 77th one as I said.","Scott Mushkin","Yeah, I don't think I've done 77 but I've done a few myself so congratulations. ","J. Mike Schlotman","Some days it feels like you've done more than that Scott.","Scott Mushkin","So market share, you guys usually ran through market share on the fourth quarter and I was just wondering if you could give us some thoughts on what's happening with the market share during the year and then I wanted to follow up? ","J. Mike Schlotman","Yeah, when you think about market share the way it's traditionally calculated our market share did grow in the year as Rodney talked about our tonnage was actually better than what our ID's sales were. And as you invest in price and things like that it can distort the top line but you're moving, you continue to grow tonnage. But it does slightly improve for the year. ","Scott Mushkin","Market share.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes.","Scott Mushkin","And when you're talking tonnage when we look at the ID's you're excluding about 50 basis points from specialty pharma contribution, is that correct or no?","J. Mike Schlotman","Let me understand you, I don\u2019t understand your question exactly. ","Scott Mushkin","Oh, I thought you put specialty pharma into the comp, I forget what quarter you did that, was it first quarter of last year\u2026 ","W. Rodney McMullen","No, we started at the beginning of the year. Yeah on tonnage what we try to do is just look at the absolute number of units that's flowing through our stores. So the toilet paper counters; one, whether it's a one pack or club pack size. But it's just looking at the units that are flowing through our stores is how we try to track it","Scott Mushkin","Perfect and my follow up question is, I know you guys have been working on alternative revenues for a while so I assume in 2018 numbers is a chunk of that EBIT that's alternative revenues, I was just wondering if you could size how big the year-over-year gain was and how big the alternative revenues are already?","Gary Millerchip","I think as we as we mentioned a few minutes ago we saw a really nice growth in alternative profits year-over-year, the two biggest areas as you know from the Analyst Meeting, our Media, and Kruger Personal Finance and both of those grew profitability by over 20% joining 2018. As I kind of referred to earlier, we are still really wanting to work through What is the best way to be able to give you the full picture around alternative profit going forward is becoming obviously a bigger and more meaningful part of our business. As Mike mentioned, Mike Schlotman mentioned earlier with the fuel being a headwind in 2019 we expect both, what you traditionally think of as the core business and alternative profits both to be contributing to the improvement in FIFO operating profit in 2019 with the head win that we're facing in fuel. But at this point we're really taking a step back and determining what's the best way to ready share the alternative profit story in a meaningful way. So all of you to make sure that we connect the dots for everybody. And if you remember back at the Investor Conference here in 2018 Stuart Aitken had a slide that showed the slope of the growth of alternative profit. Admittedly it didn't have the dollars on it. But if you take a look at that slide it shows how we expected to continue to build over time and as that momentum starts. You'll see even more growth out in the future.","Scott Mushkin","Alright guys, thank you, thanks very much. ","W. Rodney McMullen","We have time for one more question.","Operator","The next question will come from Gregory Badishkanian of Citi.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great, thanks. So just a follow-up on that food inflation you've mentioned it was 39 basis points. So I am just wondering how much -- how you'd expect that to trend in 2019 and also just your ability to pass that amount or even may be a greater than that in terms of customer?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yeah, our expectations for inflation in 2019 is relatively benign. But I would say the way it gets passed on depends a lot about where the inflation comes from. Is it in a category where we have a specific pricing program that we want to stay committed to or is it in a category where it might be a little easier to pass on and others are passing it on along as well. So, it really depends exactly where you wind up seeing the inflation whether or not it gets passed along and how quickly gets passed along.","Gregory Badishkanian","Right, makes sense and then just you know with a lot of discussion in the press about Amazon opening up physical stores, how would you characterize the level of risk to larger conventional food retailers from that move and what are kind of things that are maybe embedded in terms of your competitive positioning and your footprint that would help to offset that?","W. Rodney McMullen","Well a couple of things. First of all as you know we embarked upon creating an omnichannel experience for our customers almost five years ago now. And if you look at the feedback our customers give us we're increasingly being able to help it -- help the customer make it easier for them to get what they want. And what we find is when customers are engaged digitally they still come into the physical store and they also spend more with us in total. So our teams have done a great job of being able to create that and make sure that we keep that customer connection and continuing to improve that customer connection. The thing that we've had for years is we have 4060000 associates out there that are just every day working hard to serve our customers and each other. The quality of our fresh product continues to get better and better and it's a competitive advantage. When you take all of those things together and we have a lot of great physical locations that are high quality sites that have been accumulated over several years, it's really all of those things together. In terms of what will cause a customer to want to come from us and partner with us and for us to be able to give them an experience they can't get somewhere else. And very excited about where we are and as Gary mentioned in the prepared remarks from a digital standpoint we would expect that to become a tailwind in 2019.","Gregory Badishkanian","Great, thank you. ","W. Rodney McMullen","Thanks Greg, appreciate it. As always thank you for everyone's call. As I mentioned at the beginning we understand and acknowledge that we have our work cut out for us in the market showed at this morning. But I want to emphasize that we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call also is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insight on our business. And of course many of our associates are shareholders as well. ","So as always before we end today's call I'd like to share a few comments directed toward them. As I mentioned earlier in our prepared remarks Kroger believes in strengthening the communities where we do business, within our supply chain, across our communities, and in our stores. And you don't have to look far to see how much that strength comes from women. This month we're excited to recognize all the women across the Kroger Enterprise who worked day in and day out to exemplify our purpose to feed the human spirit. Kroger employs more 250,000 women who work in our stores, manufacturing, and distribution plants, and offices. A growing number of nearly 500 women owned businesses here in the U.S. are Kroger suppliers and through our commitment to source foods that are fair trade certified as part of our simple truth product line. We are proud to support women owned cooperatives and businesses internationally including women led tea farms in Rwanda. Kroger is proud to join in today's celebration of the International Women's Day and we are lighting up our headquarters building in Cincinnati tomorrow to celebrate.","Thank you to all of our customers, associates, and suppliers who make our business successful every year of every day -- every day of every year. I also want to have one last thank you for Mike, 77 calls is a heck of a lot of calls. Mike has been a great friend and partner in this journey and Gary, congratulations I'm incredibly looking forward to working with you and for you to be able to build on the things that Mike has put in place and working with his team. So congratulations. That completes our call today, thanks for joining.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kate, and welcome to investor relations. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Let me just start by saying wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin excluding fuel.","Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers.","We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, pickup at the store service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's express lane. I am pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from one market to seven markets. We continue to improve the offering and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship to home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Sooper's division. We are also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.","We are very excited about this new community focused grocery store concept called Main & Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products, all at affording prices. It re-imagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.","2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.","Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers, whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new Corporate Brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth.","Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates including high volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities.","Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. In the past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising healthcare costs to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices, yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending. That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high quality offerings, such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head, or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.","2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders.","Now, Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, wow, what a year. We exceeded all four of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points with 17 markets of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS Plus data up and just one market down.","We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated. So I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year, and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment. There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%.","Tonnage stayed strong, with over 3% unit growth during the quarter. And the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's by 4.4% in the quarter.","All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli, and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to return to levels where more customers can re-enter the category or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation.","Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year, however, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's, and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Company Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.","There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including charge-backs related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and healthcare costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher healthcare cost claims that occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.","In December, we said that volatility and weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter, as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year.","Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results.","Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08 times compared to 2.14 times during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.","I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California, and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare, and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.","Turning now to our 2016 guidance, we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the five-year average, with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend which is expected to increase over time.","In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end, the second quarter below that range. And keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year. The third quarter at the midpoint and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions, and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. We expect Kroger's full-year FIFO operating margin in 2016 excluding fuel to expand slightly compared to 2015 results.","Now I will turn it back to Rodney.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mike.","2015 was an outstanding year. We delivered on our performance targets, grew market share, created 9,000 new jobs and even more opportunities for our associates, and we continue to expand the use of our technology to drive growth. We look forward to continuing that momentum in 2016. Obviously, lower inflation will be a headwind to sales. But when you look back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation. And we've shown that regardless of the environment, we consistently do our job to manage through it and maintain relative pricing. In doing so, we'll continue to deliver greater value for our customers and for our shareholders.","Now, we look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to dive into \u2013 good morning. I just wanted to dive into the near-term outlook. Mike, I think you said the tonnage was just fantastic during the quarter and actually better than last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, did you see tonnage slow?","And then as you look at the cadence in the quarter, it does seem like things fell off a little bit as we got to the last four weeks of the quarter. Any thoughts there on what the current environment is? There's a lot of nervousness out there that deflation is really starting to bite and maybe the consumer \u2013 the volumes aren't quite as good.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Our volume continues to hold up very well, Scott. When you look at even coming into this year, when you look at shipments, case shipments out of our warehouses to replenish our stores, it remains very, very strong. If you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of that product. And while for the time being it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars.","When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter and as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of a department like meat with the deflation certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is. But the unit growth continues to be very strong.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay, that's perfect. And so you didn't really notice any material change because you did come in a little bit below your guidance, I think, on the comp. And I guess in your mind, what changed a little bit there or maybe nothing did, it just was a little bit more severe than anticipated?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the biggest change was that we had almost no weather at all in the quarter. Inflation ended up being a little bit lower than what we expected. But I think that by far the biggest part would be the weather. And basically we had no benefit of weather in the fourth quarter. And most of that would have obviously shown up later in the quarter.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","So then, Rodney, this is \u2013 and then I'll yield, one just more longer-term type of question. The industry fundamentals, just generally, things seem to be changing rapidly. I know you guys expanded your ClickList. But you have a lot of, like I call them, alternate business models springing up, whether it's Green BEAN in the Midwest, which is delivering to the home, or something like a Blue Apron, obviously, the idea of click-and-collect or AmazonFresh delivering. Where do you see the industry going, and how do you see Kroger navigating that more long term? And then I'll yield, and thank you for taking my questions.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Scott. When you look at long term and if you look at several of the changes we've made over the last couple of years, it is really merging with people that have expertise in some of those areas so that we could bring that within Kroger. And what we're really working hard on, and I mentioned it in my comments, is trying to create it where it's a seamless experience for our customer. By no means do I think we have arrived, but what we're finding is some customers like to engage with us multiple ways and we're really striving to make sure that we have a model where we can let the customer decide how they want to engage with us versus us deciding that. So it's an exciting time to be in the industry. There is no doubt there's a lot of change going on and the changes that we have been making over the last couple of years we feel really good about positioning us to address where the customer is headed versus where they've been. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","The next question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Okay, apologies. We have a question from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse instead.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Hi, guys. Good morning.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So a question for you. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question on inflation. I guess, Mike, first of all, do you have the inflation number for this quarter? I don't know if you gave that or not.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Just give me one second, or whatever. It's about 60 basis points overall, but there's a lot of variability in that number. As I said in my prepared comments, the meat department was deflationary, deli was deflationary, seafood was deflationary. Grocery was a little bit inflationary. So it's a mixed bag overall. And as Rodney said \u2013 if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So, produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first two quarters, about flat in the third quarter and now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can, given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And in the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year. It ended the fourth quarter at just under 5% inflation and it started the year at 10%, so it's a wide range of things that have happened throughout the year on the inflationary front.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","The question I really wanted to ask about this, if I look at your guidance for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% IDs, inflation, I think, in the 8-K said up 1% to 2%, which is not that different I guess than what 2015 is going to average out at. And you do have some difficult tonnage comparisons. You had such a great year in 2015. So I guess as we try to dissect this, is the difficult comparison in tonnage also playing a role in terms of how you're thinking about 2016? And maybe as part of all that, you can help us maybe understand why tonnage accelerated the way that it did last year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A couple things. First of all, remember, when we merge with somebody, we immediately include that company in our identicals. And I know there's other companies out there that don't include merged companies for the first year. And when you look at that effect that will change the guidance by about 40 basis points to 50 basis points on identicals in terms of what our expectations are. The other thing is \u2013 and you never know until after the fact is how does the inflation happen. And we believe that early in the year we won't see much inflation. We believe later in the year we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year. And the inflation guidance is as much affecting the LIFO estimate as it is what we really think inflation is going to be if you volume weighted it throughout the year. There's no doubt that when you cycle good numbers, the cycling is a little bit tougher. But it would be more driven by the inflation that we expect during the year and the mergers. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I absolutely agree with you. You go back into some of the fresh departments like produce. Produce inflation of almost 6% in the fourth quarter is not a good thing. That means there was probably short supply of product and the product that was there was not that high of quality. So, you can't just \u2013 one of the things we have been trying to encourage people to do is don't look at my 60 basis points of inflation. Try to dig down on the different components of it to understand how that can affect our business.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Now, if I could just squeeze in one more, because I think it's an important one, and this is for you, Rodney. Could you maybe talk about how your M&A strategy is evolving? If I think about your company over the last few years, obviously, you've been more aggressive than you were prior. You did Roundy's, which I think is something that years ago, at least from a Street perspective, we would have thought was something that maybe you wouldn't want to do a turnaround in a new market. But maybe just talk a little bit about how things are evolving, and going forward, really what you're looking for as opportunity.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It really wouldn't. If you think about the comments that we make on merger opportunities over the last five or ten years, everybody should assume that we look at most opportunities, especially if it's in the U.S. We're really looking for companies that bring something to us that we don't have today. One of the things that we loved about merging with Roundy's was, as everybody knows, that we were looking at going into a new market. By merging with Roundy's, it allowed us to go into Chicago with a business that Mariano's has done a phenomenal job on connecting with customers, and their market share is in the low teens. And they entered that market in 2010. So, we felt like we could learn a lot, plus we started out a position of strength because of the success they have had.","When you look at Wisconsin, Pick 'n Save and cost has great market share across the state. We love Wisconsin. It's a market that we really like and we look forward to operating in it. So, it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So, it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we've merged with somebody. But I wouldn't \u2013 I don't think you should read into that, that our strategies have just fundamentally changed in terms of the way we approach things.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The other thing about Roundy's, particularly in Wisconsin, as Rodney said, not only did they have the very strong market share even though it's declined, the real estate sites they had were phenomenal. And we probably would not have considered a transaction like this if they didn't have outstanding real estate sites where we know we can grow their market share back to where it once was.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point, Mike. There is no doubt, if we didn't feel great about the real estate we would not have embarked on merging with Roundy's.","Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks, guys.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ed.","Operator","And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Having technological (28:47).","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning. Karen, you're hard to hear.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Can you hear me?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, barely. Go ahead.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, sorry. I'm in Asia. I guess I'll be quick. CapEx for 2016 seems way higher than I would have expected. Can you give any color there? And I guess I was also wondering if you could give some puts and takes on how Roundy's might impact your comp for 2016 in terms of guidance?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Relative to the CapEx, as you know, we talked about our fill-in market strategy back in October of 2012 and we had expected a steady step-up in the CapEx. The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market, in the Washington, D.C.\/Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's not only to support the plan they had in place. There were a lot of plans they would have had that given their financial position they couldn't have executed on. So, there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategy as we would have thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition. And the other thing that's in there for Roundy's is probably a little bit of capital for conversions and the like on systems and so forth.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And on the identical piece, I mentioned that mergers in total, if you look at our guidance we gave, you should assume about 40 basis points to 50 basis points as the impact from the mergers that we've done.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And sorry, what, last follow-up in terms of CapEx is $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, the new base that we should use and grow a couple hundred million off of that every year going forward? And then can you just give some update on what the pharmacy impact is on the comps in 2016?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As far as the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, we will continue to increase our CapEx and execute our fill-in strategy so long as we're seeing the performance on the stores we're opening achieve the budgeted expectations so that they become the fuel for the engine. And from a granular standpoint, I don't think I'll get into department by department expectations for ID sales.","Karen F. Short - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Karen.","Operator","And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the experiments in formats that you're doing. Obviously, you're looking at how to connect more broadly digitally with your customers, but I think \u2013 and maybe I missed a little bit of what you were saying, Rodney, but that the Main & Vine, maybe just talk a little bit about what the goal is with that test and where you think that can go.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We think it's always important to be trying different approaches to connecting with customers. As you know, we've had phenomenal success in natural and organic over the last several years and we really see customers continuing to see that as important. But with that said, there's certain items where the customer still wants to buy everyday stuff. And when you look at Main & Vine, what we're trying to do is to merge those two pieces but connect at a local level a little deeper than we normally would.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And that would be a smaller store, 35,000 square feet, 40,000 square feet as opposed to what you build for most new Kroger's?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the store would be probably more likely in the 22,000 square foot to 30,000 square foot type store.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just the other \u2013 and I'm assuming that Main & Vine is not aimed at the lowest income customer. I know you've been testing Ruler. What are your thoughts about that format or whatever you need to do to extend the test? Aldi is going to be expanding, I'm not sure how significant it will be, but customer feedback is actually surprisingly good about Aldi. So maybe you could just talk about your dealing with that lower end customer.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. If you look at Main & Vine and Ruler, they are definitely targeted to a different customer, so I would agree with your comment completely. On Ruler, we're still trying to understand the economics of the model to get to where it actually performs at an ROIC that we're happy with. We continue to make progress, but we do not think we've figured it out.","We have a tremendous amount of respect for Aldi and Lidl as well. We've spent as much time in Lidl stores as we have Aldi stores over the years, and Lidl has done a great job when you look at a lot of the European countries. So we have a lot of respect for those formats. There are certain customers that we believe likes to shop in that environment. Everything that we can tell, it's not all customers. It is a customer segment, and what we're trying to do is to serve that segment. And if you look at Main & Vine, it's the same thing. There's a customer segment that we don't think anybody out there is really serving, and we're trying to identify a model that will serve that customer.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then just as my follow-up question on Main & Vine, do those stores need to be located where the customer is lower middle income, or is it more that it's near a fair amount of population that isn't very affluent?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at Main & Vine, it's very, very early. And we only have one store. And it's only been open a few weeks. From customer demographics, we would be looking more at a customer that would be overly influenced on speed and convenience for dinner, and a little bit more bent for natural and organic. So that would be the customer that we would be looking for, and it would be driven by \u2013 more by that than economics.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, that's very helpful. Thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Meredith. And I think this is your last call. We really appreciate you following us over the years and best wishes on a beautiful retirement. And thank you for the partnership with Kroger and thank you for the friendship.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, Rodney. That's very, very sweet of you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Take care, Meredith.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question will come from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks, guys. I'm going to cheat and sneak in two quick ones. Just another one on inflation, you guys commented on the protein deflation and then produce being inflationary this quarter. Can you give us any color on just what's playing out in center of store overall from an inflation or deflationary standpoint, any thoughts looking through 2016 here?","And maybe even tied into that, just competition, any update there? Walmart has been making efforts in produce in the Supercenters. Neighborhood Market actually had a very good comp still in the most recent quarter. Just anything competitively, maybe even specifically, versus Walmart you can comment on? Thanks.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When you look at the grocery category from an inflation or deflation standpoint in the fourth quarter, it was slightly inflationary. I would remind you that for us, we categorize milk in the dairy case overall in the grocery category. If you were to take the effect of lower cost and lower retails of milk out, the grocery department would have been closer to 1% inflation.","And relative to the competitive environment, we pay attention to every competitor and what they're doing. As Rodney said, we get into a lot of our competitor stores. I think a lot of this, when we travel around, whether it's domestically or internationally, we probably often get into as many or more competitor stores as our own stores to keep an eye on what everybody else is trying to do. But what we really wake up every day trying to do is to make sure we're focused on our customers and understand what our customers want and try to deliver more on that every day. Certainly in the background is what the competitive landscape is. But with the knowledge and understanding we have of what drives our customers, that is our primary focus.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","One other thing I would just add, and this is a Kroger comment. We've invested a lot in our fresh departments, especially this year. And we've invested a lot in labor to improve the experience for our customers. I know our customers are giving us good feedback on what we've done. I think every competitor is really working hard to get better. And the customer is telling us the changes we're making, they like what we do.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. And just on the grocery inflation ex-milk, anything we should think about for 2016 that would make it different than what you guys saw in 2015?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess I would answer that as who knows. You could have a weather disruption or any number of items that happen during the year. You could have a bumper crop of corn and wheat or a horrible crop of corn and wheat and it changes the dynamics of not only the fresh departments but the grocery categories.","I think when you look at our own ability or inability to predict where LIFO may wind up, when you really predict an inflation on one day at the end of the year and the amount of units you will have, it's just so volatile. Our job is we try to understand what's going on, on a regular basis and make sure we're delivering on our customers' wants and needs. Thanks, Robby.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking my question. So first I just want to start off. Mike, I know you talked a lot about and you gave us color on some of the expense pressures that you saw during Q4, and it sounds like many of them could be transitory. I just wanted to get a sense of what type of expense pressures do you expect in 2016 on your business.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There are always expense pressures out there. And as I said in the prepared comments, there are some that we would expect to mitigate and go away over time, most likely by the end of the first quarter, things like the charge-backs from the EMV conversion. We can and will and need to do a better job on shrink control. We know that opportunity is out there and is staring us in the face. We have some processes and tools that we're testing today to make us more successful in that category.","We also understand that, as I said in our labor negotiations, pension and healthcare costs, there are some that we face that some of our non-union competitors don't face to the same extent. And we have to make sure that's front and center as we negotiate the list of contracts I spoke of that are up this year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And when you look at the year overall, we would expect to be able to continue to manage where our costs are going down. And we have a ton of process changes that we're working on to take costs out of the business.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I absolutely agree, Rodney. Our goal is year-over-year to be able to continue to reduce our total operating costs.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As a percent of sales without fuel.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. And then my follow-up question. Is it possible to get the quarter-to-date trends?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you look at quarter to date on identicals, it would be a little bit below the bottom of the range. That's consistent with where we thought we would be at this point. The weather \u2013 the cycling of weather continues to be \u2013 because we just basically have had no weather benefits. But if you look at where we are, it's consistent with where we thought we would be so far.","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you for all the color.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","So, just curious if you guys can talk to the impact of the capital program. I guess specifically this year on the P&L and then also cash flow meaning will all the incremental footage, does that weigh on ex-fuel EBIT margin a bit? Is this the peak year for that? And then how does this impact utilization of free cash, particularly how you think about buyback?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think this will be the peak year, but it will be getting close to the peak year. We're going to \u2013 when you talk about a 100 major store projects for us, we haven't done that many major projects in quite a while. They are typically a drag for a while before they start generating positive EBITDA. So I don't think we're there yet. It certainly \u2013 when we build our model, we certainly contemplate the effect of our capital program as well as making sure that we continue to get the contribution from those stores that are a year or two old today that should be throwing off some significant EBITDA to help us manage through the process.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. But it would be very close.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And how about the cash flow impact?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Say that again?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Cash flow.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just the cash flow impact.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you look at our free cash flow generation over the last several years, I think we're in a good spot relative to being able to continue to execute with the expanded CapEx, a strong dividend, and we expect it to grow over time, as well as executing a buyback strategy. We would expect to do all three of those.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. When you look at on a cash flow, we have also made great progress on improving working capital, which is funding part of it as well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","And then maybe for you, Rodney, more strategically, when you think about the non-food side of the Marketplace, how would you \u2013 how do you think that will evolve? How would you like that to evolve? And is it possible you can get broad distribution of more brands that maybe you haven't been able to get to date?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we would certainly expect over time that there would be more of the brands \u2013 bigger brands would sell to us. When those companies understand that we're going to treat their brand and respect their brand and support it just like they do. And we partner with a ton of great branded companies out there. And what we believe we can do over time is to show them that we're going to take care and grow and support their brand just like they do. If you look at the non-food side of the Marketplace store, we think it will continue to evolve over time. So it's one of those things where what we do today is different than what we did two years ago, what customers tell us is they like what we do today better than we did two years ago. But we still think there's still \u2013 it will never stop evolving.","But, as you know, when you look at the grocery side, it doesn't stop evolving either. And customers give us good feedback on that side of the store. Because it's things they pick up because they find a great value for what they find. It's something at a very reasonable price.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, John.","Operator","And the next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to ask a bit further on Roundy's. Can you guys just give us a little bit more color in terms of now you're a month and a half or so in? What have you found to be kind of, let's take the main conventional banners for a second, in terms of the amount of work that needs to be done? Is it more kind of assortment? What percentage may need more true remodels or anything like that?","And then maybe on Mariano's, anything worth noting that needs to be done versus maybe just looking towards future expansion?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If you look at Mariano's, that brand is incredibly strong and it's really supporting the brand that's been built and continuing to build out that. When you look at Wisconsin, it really reminds me of where Kroger was several years ago. And it's really embarking on the same journey that we have been over the last several years in terms of all the items that you talked about.","The two things \u2013 I guess three things. One, there's a lot of learnings that we can bring back into Kroger from Mariano's, if you look at some of the things that we're really working hard with Roundy's in total is bringing the synergies of $110 billion company to procurement and using 84.51\u00b0 to help with insights there that we've obviously had a long successful journey on. I don't know, Mike, anything else you would want to add?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we spent a lot of time in the Wisconsin market before we decided to go ahead with the merger. I don't think there's probably not a store in Wisconsin that some member of our senior management team hasn't been in and many of the stores we would have been in multiple times all over the state. We understood \u2013 we had a good understanding of what investments we're going to need to make in infrastructure, what improvements we may need to make from potential resets or incremental hours in stores to better serve customers. So, we factored in the things that before we could actually sit down across the table of what we thought we needed to do to bring them back to the market share they once had.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We really feel good about the people. And as you know, Roundy's had a tremendous amount of debt, which didn't give them the financial flexibility to do some of the things they would have liked to have done. And we really \u2013 the associates on Roundy's, they care so much about the customers. Senior leadership really does want to support the stores on improving the experience for customers. So, that's one area where I thought we would feel good about, but I actually feel even better than what we thought going in.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","That is helpful. Thank you. And maybe just one more quick one here. Just going back to Main & Vine and appreciate the color with Meredith's question there. But just to kind of help us picture until the folks on this phone can get into the store itself, but I know it's early, but can you just give us a little bit more sense for is there going be a lot of Simple Truth, private label offering kind of maybe a little bit more around the initial mix that you're testing at this point or \u2013 and anything else that would be helpful.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Probably the biggest thing that would be easy is if you look at the fresh departments, the amount of space dedicated to fresh departments would be very high. The other thing that we would do is really try to make sure we are doing all we can to support local food suppliers. So, local coffee, local cheeses, local bakeries, those items.","If you look at the grocery side that would really be \u2013 it would be Simple Truth in the store, but there would also be a lot of natural and organic. I don't \u2013 and I guess the other department that would be a little bit expanded would be on the health and wellness and cosmetics and some of those things and even supporting the local community.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, very helpful. Thank you, guys.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mike just made another point to me that we used our 84.51\u00b0 insights to set what to carry in the store and how to set the store. And it's a store where we have completely used the data to determine that.","Vincent J. Sinisi - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Vincent.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was a bit surprised to hear that the quarter to date ID number was light or lighter than I think some people hoped for, because I would have thought that the Super Bowl shift would have helped a bit. And I would have thought, just based on your guidance from 1Q to be better, that maybe the top line would have been better there. So maybe those things are true, but just a lack of favorable weather was bigger than we thought. I'm just trying to get some sense of the sizing of the impact of, I guess, football and weather on the quarter and also sort of an explanation, and maybe I just missed it, of how the comp sales are going to be lower but the EPS are going to be higher at the ends of your ranges.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When you look at the quarter to date, it is \u2013 Super Bowl selling was great but almost every week or really every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flesh itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter when we worked up against weather when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased and units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into a new year. So we'll work our way through that.","Relative to your question on IDs not where they were but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were, that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that. In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect I said of milk on the top line. Milk generated good profit in the year for us. Headwind to report at ID sales, absolutely. But overall, the generation of profitability in milk was strong for the year.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And remember the other comment I made earlier is we would expect inflation to be lower in the early part of the year and higher later part of the year. But when you look at inflation overall, we have operated our business in low inflation and high inflation and we have been successful in both environments.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And then my follow-up on M&A. I think you said that your \u2013 and you've said this previously, you're always looking for something, whether it's capabilities or geography that you don't have today. I think one of the concerns out there is that Kroger may be more amenable to deals that would be considered, I guess, surprising to the Street than they used to be. Because looking for something you don't have today kind of leaves you open to almost anything. You could go in to a new format, a new country. So I'm just curious for investors out there listening, are there limitations to what you would buy, even if it's something that you would consider new in terms of what you don't have now?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll go back to what I said before. You shouldn't expect the way we would look at merging any different today than over the last several years. And as you mentioned in your comments, you should assume that we would look at most things. And I added a second ago in the U.S. So you shouldn't think that all of a sudden you're going to see us in some place that we have no knowledge or no synergies.","On the capability, we're really looking at things that are in our core business. So we're in the food business and we're in the health and wellness business. Those are the areas where we're going be focused on how do we get a deeper and better connection with our customers. So you shouldn't assume something that's out in left field.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Next question comes from Zack Fadem of Wells Fargo.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Just to stick with Roundy's for a minute, how are you thinking about the timeline of just integration and investments throughout fiscal 2016? And have you started to roll out things like price investments and store improvements yet? And given the volatile deflationary environment, have you considered delaying price investments in certain categories?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We have a timeline developed for how we're going to work with the Roundy's team, particularly in Wisconsin. I'm not going to get into what that timeline is, but you should assume it's not just a 2016 effort. It would be very similar to how we've done overall investments at Kroger, and it will be multifaceted over a fairly long time horizon.","I don't think there's anything in our minds that would cause us to delay what we think we need to do at Roundy's because of the current operating environment. As Rodney said, we're as bullish as we were six months ago when we were looking at this. It's only been two months. The deal closed December 18, so it's only been two and a half months. You certainly didn't disrupt our team or their team during the holiday selling season. So it was really after the first of the year where we first started sitting down one-on-one with them and developing plans and strategies. And we feel very good about what our plans are going forward.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we've done a ton of work with research and working with the Roundy's team to try to understand the customer and understand the customer wants and needs. And the plan will actually be starting to execute against our understanding of the customer wants and needs. And some of it will be test and some of it will be to go do it.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And just as a follow-up, big picture, you've implemented a ton of productivity initiatives over the years in your stores, shorter checkouts, labor efficiencies. I'm curious where you think there's additional room for improvement in your stores. You mentioned shrink as one of them. Is there anything new planned for fiscal 2016 to drive better efficiency, particularly with so many remodels and expansion projects planned?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The short answer is yes. And I'm trying to figure out a way to help you get insight without giving away something that our competitors wouldn't know about. There are several projects that we have underway. Technology and process change would be a big part of those. And if you look at the things for 2016 that are being executed against and we're actually starting to work on some of the things that we will do in 2017 as well.","Zachary Fadem - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, I really appreciate the color.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Zack.","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, and we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay. And that final question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi, good morning. Thanks for fitting me in.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the guidance and the inflation outlook for a second. If I'm hearing you correctly, so the ID guidance 2.5% to 3.5% includes a 40 to 50 basis point drag from Roundy's. So if you take that out, you're in that 3% to 4% range, which is just what you guided to last year. And also, you also guided to a 1% to 2% inflation outlook last year. So am I right to think that it's really the same but that maybe the products within the categories are a little bit different and the pace may be accelerating throughout the year instead of decelerating throughout the year? Or what's really different, I guess?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You did a better job of explaining what we were saying. Really, that's what we would think is early in the year we're cycling a little the inflation higher last year, lower this year. We would expect as we get later in the year that we would be a little higher inflation, if you think about the dairy comment that Mike made. We'll soon start cycling lower dairy prices in some of those things. So your comment is absolutely correct on all those pieces.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And then just in terms of the drag from Roundy's this year, is that something that we should think about for maybe a couple of years? Or what's a reasonable timeframe to expect that to maybe not get in line with the rest of the base but to be less of a drag?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you just look at our own models, we would think it would take two to three years before we'd get to where it would look more like a typical Kroger division. If you look at our merger model, that's the type of the timeframe that we used. And we wouldn't see it any different today than, I don't know, Mike, any other insight that you would want to add?","J. Michael Schlotman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I agree with you. We aren't going to go too fast and we aren't going to go too slow. And if we were to have a bias towards one or the other, it would be a little bit slower than a little bit too fast because what we have seen in the broad spectrum of M&A out there is when folks try to go a little too fast, they're usually not as successful long term.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. And I just wanted to maybe end with just a question on Simple Truth. I think you said it was growing at an incredible rate. I think it's been in the double-digit range in the past. Just what are you seeing there? What are you expecting from Simple Truth in 2016? I think you mentioned some new categories that have been launched in the recent year. How are you thinking about even more categories, or what are you expecting really from that in 2016?","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It has been incredibly strong, as I mentioned. It was $1.5 billion brand for us last year. And if you recall, three years ago was when we launched the brand. We're finding very good early results. We're really looking at it more as a lifestyle brand versus narrower just food. And the additional categories we have added, it's been very good initial customer connection. So, we really see continued growth opportunity for the brand. And probably even stronger than what we would have thought initially, so it's exciting.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, thank you.","W. Rodney McMullen - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kelly.","Before we end today's call, I would like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As you know, a lot of our associates listen into the call each quarter. Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers, each other, and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter. Like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store, just awesome. Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work.","Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension, and other benefits, you have told us that work-life balance is important too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family, and other events and responsibilities. Fourteen of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now. And several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We worked closely with our union locals to introduce this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive.","As always, thank you again for your continued commitment to Kroger and our customers. That completes today's call.

With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2011 results are Rodney McMullen, our company President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","We are very pleased with Kroger's outstanding performance in fiscal year 2011 and strong fourth quarter financial results. That we were able to raise earnings per share and identical sales guidance through the year and achieve those higher results demonstrates the strength of our business strategy and momentum for a strong 2012. ","Kroger's strong performance rewarded shareholders in 2011. We delivered adjusted earnings of $2 per diluted share, a 15% increase in earnings over 2010. We hit the high end of guidance despite a much higher LIFO charge. We increased our quarterly dividend payment by almost 10%, and we implemented an aggressive stock buyback program using Kroger's strong free cash flow to repurchase 67 million shares. Later, Rodney and Mike will provide more details on our full year performance. I'd like to highlight several of the commitments that our teams successfully delivered on in 2011. ","Kroger increased identical supermarket sales. We grew market share. We effectively used free cash flow to reward shareholders and invested wisely to continue to win customer loyalty. Importantly, we also balanced cost reductions with investments in our Customer 1st strategy to increase FIFO operating margin for the year. Kroger is off to a healthy start for the year ahead, and we expect earnings per share growth in 2012 to exceed our business model. ","Kroger had strong performance in the fourth quarter. Identical supermarket sales for the quarter increased 4.9%, excluding fuel. More loyal and total households are shopping with us, and identical sales are up among both groups. This consistent sales performance contributed to Kroger's market share gains in fiscal 2011. And we achieved the high end of growth estimates for both earnings per share and identical sales growth. ","Our operating performance was broad-based and consistent across the company. Every operating division achieved positive identical sales for the quarter, and every supermarket department achieved positive identical sales. Our natural food, pharmacy, produce and deli departments posted the strongest results. I'm very proud of our associates for bringing customer -- the Customer 1st strategy to life for our customers. Our relentless focus on our 4 keys, our people, prices, products and shopping experience, is why Kroger has achieved an industry-leading 33 consecutive quarters of positive identical supermarket sales results. Our associates work to please and delight our shoppers inspires customer loyalty, which grows our business and generates shareholder returns. Simply put, we put our Customer 1st -- when we put our customers first, shareholders win. ","Well, as we look to 2012, we expect the external environment to be a little better than 2011. All of the data we're seeing suggests the overall economy and customer sentiment are improving. Both give us reason to be optimistic about the year ahead. We're also mindful that consumer sentiment is fragile. And as we've seen over the last few years, it can be affected by external factors such as rising gas prices and geopolitical issues. So we will continue to carefully monitor the pace of economic recovery, higher gas prices and the slowing of the rate of inflation. And while these factors will influence all retailers, our success will come from making tactical adjustments as needed throughout the year, just as we did throughout 2011. ","Rodney will now offer insight into Kroger's strong business trends in the fourth quarter and 2011 market share statistics. Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our focus on building loyal customer base continues to increase sales and reward shareholders. Today, close to 50% of all U.S. households carry one of our loyalty cards. That percentage obviously is much higher in the markets where we operate. ","One of the ways we create value for our customers is by leveraging scale and position as a share leader in most of the markets in which we operate. Even with Kroger's deep market penetration, we have a tremendous opportunity to increase incremental spending among our loyal customers, who on average spend about $0.50 of every food dollar with Kroger.  Kroger's partnership with dunnhumby is another powerful way we build our loyal household base. The unique customer insights gained from our loyalty data help us reward our most loyal customers with highly relevant, personalized offers for the products they like and buy regularly. ","In the fourth quarter, the number of loyal households shopping with us increased, as did the total number of households. Loyal household unit purchases and price per unit sold were both up in the fourth quarter compared to the same time last year as well. While our loyal customers are buying fewer items each trip, they are buying more on a monthly basis. A key indicator that our loyal customer strategy is working is that our identical sales growth among loyal households outpaced the growth for total households. For the full year, our number of loyal households continued to increase as did the number of their visits. Total household shopping at our stores also increased year-over-year. ","We still anticipate inflation in 2012, but we expect to end the year with a rate of inflation lower than at the beginning of the year. The increase in food costs moderated slightly in the fourth quarter, with year-over-year product cost inflation of approximately 5.4%, excluding retail fuel. Higher prices have taken a toll on all customers, but our very price-sensitive customers continue to suffer disproportionately.  Most departments experienced inflation during the quarter. The produce department ran counter to this trend in the fourth quarter, experiencing deflation. We are passing along product cost increases from national brand suppliers and plan to continue to do so. At the same time, we slightly increased our penny profit per item in the grocery category in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. As always, our popular corporate brand products continue to offer customers thousands of quality, affordable choices to fit into any budget. ","Looking at unit sales. Similar to the third quarter, tonnage was essentially flat and slightly improving as we ended this year. We expect to see improving trends in tonnage growth as the economic conditions improve and inflation moderates. While the industry as a whole experienced the effects of consumer caution and higher food prices, Kroger performed exceptionally well by staying relevant and providing value when and where customers needed it most. ","For example, when we saw customers under pressure in the second quarter, we accelerated investments to alleviate some of that pressure. Even as inflation forced shoppers to be more budget-conscious, our customers continued to experience Kroger's unique value proposition, a convenient and superior shopping experience, low prices and with hot weekly promotions, personalized rewards developed through our dunnhumby partnership and our popular Fuel Points savings program. That collection of benefits, teamed with our high-quality, competitively priced corporate brand offering, positions Kroger to win in the marketplace today while investing for the future. ","Kroger's strong corporate brands continued to gain share in the fourth quarter. Corporate brands represented approximately 27% of the grocery department sales dollars and 35% of the grocery department units sold. Corporate brand sales dollars were up more than national brand sales dollars for the quarter as well. As Dave said, one of our fastest growing departments is natural foods. Our customers told us they want organic and natural products that are easily identified and affordable. So we launched our new Simple Truth Natural and Simple Truth Organic brands in November, focusing first on milk and eggs, with plans to expand into other categories throughout 2012. Another successful growth category for corporate brands is yogurt. We've leveraged our manufacturing competitive advantage to accelerate the growth of our corporate brand Greek yogurts. Greek yogurt sales have doubled in each of the last 3 years, with Kroger's offering outpacing the category in unit and dollar growth. ","Now turning to market share for 2011. We look at market share the way customers look at it, where they spend their money. According to Nielsen Homescan data, Kroger's overall share of products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during fiscal 2011. This data also indicates that our share increased in 13 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report and declined in 6 areas.  Walmart Supercenters are our primary competitor in 17 of the 19 marketing areas outlined by the Nielsen report. Kroger's overall product sales in those 17 markets grew approximately 40 basis points during fiscal 2011. This Nielsen Homescan data is generated by customers who self-report their grocery purchases to Nielsen. This includes all retail outlets that sell the same products that we do. ","Next, I'd like to give you an update on labor relations. As you realized, our associates play a big part in building customer loyalty. Kroger's commitment to our associates include our dedication to safety, significant investments in training, solid wages and good-quality, affordable health care. We have to deliver this in ways that allow us to operate competitively with the nonunion retailers in each of the markets that we serve. Kroger financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs. Cooperation between Kroger and the local unions that represent many of our associates is essential. We have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business, and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities for all of our associates. ","We are pleased that our associates ratified a master agreement with the Teamsters covering 3 distribution centers and 2 dairies. Currently, negotiations are under way with the UFCW for store associates in Memphis and Las Vegas. In 2012, we had labor contracts expiring in Dayton and Columbus, Ohio; Indianapolis; Louisville; Nashville; Phoenix and Portland. ","Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's 2011 financial results and our 2012 guidance. Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Including the effect of the UFCW pension plan consolidation, Kroger reported a net loss for the fourth quarter that totaled $306.9 million or $0.54 per diluted share. Excluding the effect of the pension consolidation, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $283.8 million or $0.50 per diluted share. It is important to keep in mind LIFO was $31 million or $0.03 per diluted share, higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. ","Net earnings in the same period last year were $278.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin as reported was 21.13% of sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal -- of the year. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 47 basis points from the same period last year. As I said earlier, our LIFO charge was higher than expected, totaling $73.4 million. This compares to $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. ","Excluding retail fuel operations and the pension consolidation, our OG&A, including rent and depreciation, declined 21 basis points. OG&A declined 8 basis points, rent declined 3 basis points and depreciation declined 10 basis points. Identifying and executing sustainable operating cost reductions allows us to invest in all 4 elements of our Customer 1st strategy: our great people, our product offering, our customer shopping experience and lower prices for our customers. ","Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2011 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. In the fourth quarter, Kroger's retail fuel operation has generated identical gallon growth. These outlets earned approximately $0.124 per gallon compared to $0.102 in the final quarter of fiscal 2010. This part of our business benefited Kroger's year-over-year net earnings per share increase for the fourth quarter by $0.02. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.139 in 2011 compared with $0.122 in 2010. ","Turning now to Kroger's full year fiscal results for 2011 and excluding the effect of the pension consolidation, earnings for 2011 were $1.2 billion or $2 per diluted share. Including the effect of the pension consolidation, fiscal year 2011 earnings were $602.1 million or $1.01 per diluted share. Full year net earnings in the prior year were $1.74 per diluted share. Our original earnings guidance -- or our original earnings per diluted share guidance for the year was $1.80 to $1.92. This contemplated a LIFO charge of $50 million to $75 million. As the year progressed, we ultimately revised our EPS expectations to $1.95 to $2, even with the LIFO charge at the time that was expected to be $185.5 -- $185 million. That we hit the high end of our increased earning expectations with a full year LIFO charge of $216 million speaks loudly to Kroger's strong underlying performance. Excluding fuel and the pension consolidation, FIFO operating margin increased by 5 basis points. This is the fourth consecutive rolling 4-quarter period with an expanded operating margin. ","Now I'll provide a little color on the effect of the pension consolidation. The charge totaled $590.7 million after tax. This affected the fourth quarter by $1.04 per diluted share and the full year by $0.99 per diluted share. The difference is due to having fewer shares outstanding in the quarter versus the year. The charge is higher than the $0.73 per diluted share we discussed in December. Our commitment under the agreement is to fund the full December 31, 2011, underfunded balance. The amount we discussed in December only addressed the cash contribution we made. For multi-employer pension plans, cash contributions and expense are usually the same. However, since we have a contractual obligation to fund a specific amount, we need to expense that incremental commitment.  We have committed to fund the remaining obligation by the end of 2018. At the time it is funded, no additional expense will be incurred. We met our additional -- we made our initial funding of $650 million on January 20, 2012, $50 million of which was attributed to 2012 plan year contributions. ","Under Kroger's share repurchase program during fiscal 2011, we invested $1.5 billion to repurchase 66.5 million shares of Kroger stock at an average price of $23.24 per share. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has $379 million remaining under the $1 billion stock repurchase program announced in September of 2011. ","We focus on identical sales growth, excluding fuel, because it is the best measure of performance to let us know that we are delivering for both our customers and shareholders. 33 quarters of consistent identical sales growth tells us that our Customer 1st strategy continues to connect meaningfully with our customers. That connection enhances customer loyalty and grows market share, which increases earnings and generates free cash flow that reward our shareholders. Customer 1st drives shareholder returns. ","Kroger's business model is structured to produce annual earnings per share growth averaging 6% to 8% plus a dividend of 1.5% to 2%, for a total shareholder return of approximately 8% to 10%. We expect this total shareholder return to compare favorably to the S&P 500 over a rolling 3- to 5-year time horizon. Annual earnings per share growth for fiscal 2012 will be higher than this due to a combination of the benefit of the 53rd week, a lower expected LIFO charge, our ability to aggressively repurchase stock during 2011 and benefits from the pension consolidation. ","Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2012. For the full year, we anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. This guidance contemplates the effect of several prescription drugs coming off patent during the year, which will reduce sales. As Rodney said, we expect units to increase if inflation moderates, so this should offset any effect of lower inflation. Full year net earnings are expected to range from $2.28 to $2.38 per diluted share. This guidance assumes the benefit of the extra week, lower LIFO, the benefit of our stock buyback program during 2011, the benefit of our pension plan consolidation and some benefit from  Express Script transfers. Kroger's quarterly dividend enhances total shareholder return by approximately 1.5% to 2%. ","I'd like to provide some additional insight on our identical sales and earnings per share expectations on a quarterly basis as well. For earnings per share, we expect the first quarter to pose the biggest challenge. Last year's first quarter presents a tough comparison, and the expected lower LIFO charge will not affect year-over-year comparisons until later in the fiscal year. Conversely, we expect identical sales to start the year stronger and trend down as prescription drugs come off patent. The generic prescriptions, which generate higher gross profit rates, along with the benefit of expected lower LIFO as the year progresses, will cause stronger earnings per share growth in the third and fourth quarter. The fourth quarter will also benefit from the 53rd week. As a result, we expect earnings per share growth in the first quarter to be flat to slightly positive, a growth rate in quarter 2 that is in line with our business model and a strong performance in the third and fourth quarters. ","We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2012, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to fiscal 2011 results. We expect to expand Kroger's nonfuel operating margin rate over time, and it remains our goal to do so. We expect our full year LIFO charge to range between $140 million and $190 million. During fiscal 2012, Kroger plans to use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and maintain its current debt rating. We expect capital expenditures to be in the $1.9 billion to $2.2 billion range for the year. ","This morning, we filed an 8-K summarizing the guidance and financial strategy that I just discussed, along with some additional items, including pension contributions and expense and our tax rate. ","Now I will turn it back to Dave.","David B. Dillon","Thanks, Mike. I am very proud of our associates for delivering such outstanding results in 2011. Our consistent performance is one of the reasons that Kroger has created more than 29,000 jobs in the past 5 years. Kroger is rewarding shareholders, and we are looking forward to another year of consistent industry-leading performance and growth. We now look forward to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of things interrelated. If you look at, Mike, the details you gave quarter-to-quarter, to what degree does that bake in anything specific with regard to moving around programs, promotions, et cetera? And I'm wondering because you talked about the second quarter last year and some of that pressure that consumers were under was fuel-related, how do you guys look at the current run-up in gas and where we might be in the spring? And is there a need to do something more this year to offset that new pressure on the consumer? So have you built that in explicitly, do you think that's something that may have to happen?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, as we've begun the year, we certainly have a plan laid out of how we expect to invest in the elements of our Customer 1st strategy, and it does contemplate what we see out there. But as we said in the prepared comments, we did make tactical adjustments throughout 2011 to react to the world around us, and we would expect to continue to do that in 2012 as well. And I think it proved out beneficial for everybody in 2011, given our results.","W. Rodney McMullen","And those tactical changes -- John, this is Rodney, won't necessarily be the same every year. And so there wouldn't necessarily -- just because of what we did last year doesn't mean we'll do the same thing this year. And it really depends on what our insights tell us that is important to our customers.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Do you think the customer will be under less pressure for whatever reason? Let's say, gas is $4, $4.25, Memorial Day, less pressure this year than last year because the macro's better? Or same pressure, more pressure, what do you think?","David B. Dillon","Well, John, those are, of course, all the right factors. And how they weigh out is going to be hard to judge. Certainly, on the plus side, the economy is clearly improving. And except for the very price-sensitive customers, which Rodney mentioned are still suffering disproportionately, otherwise, it's holding up quite well and we're very pleased with that. And customer sentiment, which is also important in how people feel about things, is also improving. Those are both good signs. So even with higher gas prices, it's possible that those factors end up overweighing that. And as you know, there are some pluses of higher gas prices for us, one is our gas promotion has a good effect. And the other is that a lot of our stores are located within a couple of miles of where customers live, and that becomes a very convenient place for them to shop when prices get high. So it's not like it's all bad news. There are certainly some bad news with it because it's less money in their pocket. But on the whole, we remain optimistic.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then just as a follow-up to that is I don't know what inflation number -- it sounds like it might be like a mid-3s number or something like that, that's baked into your LIFO charge. But is that right? And then secondly, obviously, if it comes down in the back half of the year, you'll end up with some significant adjustments in the second half. Just talk about just tactically, if LIFO ends up being $50 million, $70 million, some large number lower than you think, can that be effectively reinvested in the business or it's hard to do that effective -- productively?","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, a couple of things on LIFO. I think I've proved my inability to project LIFO throughout the year this year. And it's a very difficult thing to do. The other thing, John, to keep in mind is LIFO is a noncash charge, and it doesn't use cash or create cash when I book that charge. So if it goes up or down, it really doesn't affect my ability to have money to invest to reward our customers. Does it affect earnings per share? Absolutely, but it really doesn't give me any incremental dollars to invest somewhere else.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last thing. The 6 markets where you lost share or didn't gain share, I guess, I assume that was not a material loss of share. And was that because you didn't comp well or because some competitors may have comped particularly well for whatever reason?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. Well, when you look at those 6 markets, it's extremely modest. But a 0.1 is a 0.1 because we do take it literal in terms of what the report says. So it's not necessarily a reflection because it could actually be rounding -- but the numbers are what they are. In every market, we're very pleased with our identicals. And as Dave said, our identicals for the quarter were very broad-based across the whole country and very broad-based across all departments. And we felt very good about where we are overall.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In the last couple of months, Nielsen data, food manufacturers, some of your competitors, they've pointed to an accelerated channel shift out of traditional into some alternatives. And your numbers seem to be bucking this trend. I know you touched on how you did this, and I do appreciate that color. Just one follow-up. In your mind, are you avoiding the loss of customers that some other supermarkets have seen across-the-board? Or maybe are you losing some customers in the bottom end? As they go to some limited assortment channels, maybe you're making that up on the top end, as you gain from some consumers finding your value proposition more attractive? I'm just hoping you can sort of add a little bit more color as to how you were able impressively, frankly, to do this when some of your competitors have not.","David B. Dillon","Well, let me ask the question slightly differently. We think of market share -- and we've thought about this for years now, I'd say 15 years at least, maybe 20. Instead of looking at our traditional supermarkets, we look at the pie as being a lot bigger than that. We were looking, as Rodney said, where our customers spend their money. And because we look at it that way, our battle has been for a market share of that bigger pie. And that attitude, that viewpoint, has caused us to address it, I think, differently than some of the other traditional supermarket operators. There are some out there who have done it maybe similar in their thinking, but our objective is to solve what the customer needs solved and not to solve maybe what is a traditional supermarket equation. And that line of thinking actually has led us down this path of Customer 1st. We've talked a lot about it, and it sounds more like marketing words, but actually, we genuinely mean it. We look at the 4 elements of Customer 1st. We invest in those in the ways that we believe are meaningful to our customers. We save money in places that don't matter to the customer and reinvest it in the places that do. And I think it's that approach that has created the results that you described. I would agree with your viewpoint, we think we have not suffered the same channel changes that others have, but we've had to live in the same channel changes that others have had to live with. And we just had to address it in a different way.","W. Rodney McMullen","The only thing, Ken, that I would add -- and I agree with everything that Dave said. And I think increasingly it's probably one of the things that people look at Kroger probably incorrectly because they try to put people into channels. And if you look at what a traditional supermarket would be, and you go into our stores today, it's nothing like what that traditional supermarket used to be. And it really -- there really is a new category that we're in that we're satisfying the needs based on what customers are telling us they want that Dave outlined. And I really do think it's one of the things where, we, along with our investors, probably try to stick things into channels, and it really is what we're trying to create with our customers, a channel that's completely different than anything out there. And I think our customers are showing it and our associates are executing against it for our customers that show that, that's actually happening.","David B. Dillon","We've actually described internally what you're talking about in saying that the grocery industry as we all grew up in it really doesn't exist anymore. And we'll occasionally use the term traditional grocery because it helps relate to things that you all will describe and that you're describing now. But we don't think of that as our industry. We don't have a real good name from it other than food, but it is a broader industry than just that traditional food industry.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And sorry, just one follow-up. That's all very helpful. But how would you describe the major differences between you and a traditional grocer at this point? Because to me, and maybe I'm seeing this incorrectly, you clearly have differences but you're still selling mostly food. I mean, the prices are cheaper and you have other offerings and you have fuel and so forth, but it's more close than not. So perhaps help me understand where I'm maybe not seeing the differences.","David B. Dillon","Well, your list was right and the so forth is a longer list, too. Just contrast us with ourselves instead of looking at what you're comparing to. Look at ourselves in the 1990s to now. And even though we had good earnings growth during that time, our sales were not strong. We were losing our relevancy with customers. And we were really more focused on just producing earnings. When we moved to a point of view that says we've got to solve issues for customers, putting our customers first, that in effect, indirectly gave us a stronger result for our shareholders. And we felt it would and it has proven to be true. And sometimes in life, and I think it's definitely true in business, if you go after something directly, you may get it for a while but you won't get it forever. But if you go at it indirectly by serving the broader goal, the broader goal for us is our customer relevancy, then you end up serving the shareholders as well. And I think that's what we've seen happen. So I would prefer to contrast us with ourselves. And all of the things you described are true. Each of the 4 keys has specific things about them that we have done. We've talked about many of those over the last several years. But we've worked hard on each of the 4. It's not any one of them, it's all of them. So I don't know if that's help you anymore, but...","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'm just wondering -- a couple of questions here. I don't know if you commented on this, but what are -- I'm assuming comps are, I think, kind of trending in line with the fourth quarter results and the quarter-to-date. Is that fair?","David B. Dillon","Let me just give you a summary on it. We had, through last week, which is 4 weeks, our identical sales without fuel would be comparable to where we where in the fourth quarter. We did not update it to this week because this week frankly is not comparable because with the leap year day that we added, we now have a bigger shift in first of the month than normal. So it's not a comparable week. And we are still seeing this year and last year high variability from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and so that enters into it, too. But through the 4 weeks anyway, I'd say the identical sales were comparable.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then I guess, just looking at -- I know you've veered away from talking about thi,s, but just directionally, looking at selling gross margin. Earlier in fiscal 2011 when you were still kind of talking about it, you were discussing the cadence on a 2-year basis because there was a lot of volatility. I guess, maybe can you just give me your directional thoughts on selling gross trends into fiscal '12, same kind of level of investment in '11, a little lower, any color?","David B. Dillon","Well, first, we're not going to put it in terms of selling gross margin. While it's still an important concept for us to think of in running our business, we think it adds too much confusion to the discussion. But directionally, you've heard us say we work backwards. We said that we expect our FIFO operating margin rate to slightly improve in 2012, so that we put it in the K and described that already -- or in the 8-K we filed today. So you start with that, and everything else works back from that. You should expect, as we've said before, some additional investment in our gross margin -- FIFO gross margin. And as we do that, though, you should also expect over the course of the year, that we'll have savings that will offset that so that we end up with a slight gain in operating profit margin. I don't know if that helps, but we do expect some investment certainly.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Similar to last year, is it fair to say that you will find the savings at the early part of the year to then spend it slightly more towards latter?","David B. Dillon","I think the only comment I'd make on that is just refer back to what Mike said about the flow of the quarters through the year. That contains -- that guidance on as you think about the quarters gives you the best feel we have for the way we currently expect it to flow. But as we've pointed out, we also make tactical adjustments as the year go on. And if we've done that, we'll try to identify that if it's meaningful.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just the last question. Looking at your share repurchases in fiscal '12, I guess, obviously, this is a high year. But in '12, what do you consider kind of a more normalized cadence on the share repurchases or maybe in terms of free cash flow allocation?","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. If you look at it over time in years where we haven't done an aggressive buyback like '11, it's typically been in the $400 million to $600 million range. We like to do enough to offset dilution, and it's relatively steady throughout the year. Don't have a particular target in mind as I sit here today because some of it is driven by all of the forces around us and what other opportunities we have to invest in cash. I'm happy with my debt rating, my guidance on -- our guidance on CapEx is a little bit higher because we continue to see some phenomenal store sites come our way and some technology projects that we think will be attractive returns for the long haul.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wanted to dig in a little bit here on the OG&A line. Are there any health care and pension increases kind of embedded in that number that you're going to have to overcome throughout the year?","J. Michael Schlotman","Throughout next year?","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes.","J. Michael Schlotman","Well, I mean, the pension -- if you look at the pension overall, if you set the contracts aside where we consolidated the pension plans, the remaining plans would have some increases in them, and all OG&A would certainly have increases in them. If you look at UFCW pension plan expense overall, because of what we did in December, that contribution and expense should decline overall in 2012. And we talked about that benefit back in December when we announced the consolidation.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And moving over to your gasoline business. Are we still seeing that effect when rising gasoline prices are occurring that you get a margin drag? Because you seemed to have a pretty good margin performance this quarter and for the year.","W. Rodney McMullen","Mark, yes, that would typically be the case.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And so far in the first quarter, do you feel like there's dramatic weather difference versus last year which might be helping? Or how does that stack up?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at the weather so far, weather definitely was a bigger help last year than this year. We've had very few snowstorms this year. And obviously, when there's snowstorms, kids stay home and they eat at home versus at school. So we really haven't -- we didn't have those -- very limited benefits in the fourth quarter. We've had very little of those benefits in the first quarter also.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Scott Mushkin with Jefferies & Company.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First, just a curiosity. I know you guys have a huge pharmacy. Are you seeing any benefits from the Express, Walgreen dispute? And do you think it's going to be additive to your first quarter EPS?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look at the guidance that Mike outlined for the year, we included some benefit for Express Script transfers to Kroger. If you look at where we're trending right now, our increases are a little bit more than what we were expecting. So to the extent that it's better than what we had built in, yes, it would be a positive. Obviously, if they settled tomorrow, that would also affect the number. The other thing that we will plan to do is at the end of each quarter, give you some insight in terms of what the Express business helped us by, so you could have some insight and get a feel for that, but we did include some. But right now, we're actually doing better than what we included.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And did you guys quantify -- and maybe, Mike, I missed this. Did you quantify for the first quarter what you thought it would add to your EPS?","J. Michael Schlotman","We did not.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Did not. Is it going to be -- is it meaningful or no?","J. Michael Schlotman","We did not quantify it.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Switching gears a little bit because we've covered a lot on this call. I'm just kind of curious with the acquisition strategy. I know we talk about it every once in a while. It seems like maybe you could do some maybe larger accretive transactions. And I was just wondering, is it time to get a little bit more aggressive? And would you ever think of deploying your capital? I know you talked about the dividends and the share repurchases more aggressively in M&A.","David B. Dillon","If I had the script from the last time we answered that question, I would just replay the tape for you because it's the same answer. We're always interested, always looking, highly selective...","J. Michael Schlotman","And don't need them to make the numbers...","David B. Dillon","Yes, we don't need them to make our numbers. Lots of companies that give forecasts for the year assuming they'll make acquisitions. We never do that.","Scott Andrew Mushkin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But no consideration right now of getting a little bit more aggressive, given you guys are doing well, the channel seems to be suffering?","J. Michael Schlotman","We're not opposed to them, like Dave said, but we're not going to change the metrics we look at and stretch to do something because of the current environment. If it meets our metrics, we would certainly look at it. And if it doesn't, we won't.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about competition. I think everybody is saying that it's been quite rational. And I think having positive comps for many people because of inflation helps the psychology for retailers. But maybe you could talk a little bit about any thoughts you might have, if we end up with really modest inflation at the end of the year, do you think there's some risk that there's going to be a pickup in competition?","David B. Dillon","Well, first, I would agree with you, Meredith, that the competition has been rational. It doesn't mean it's not significant. It's been quite significant. And last year was just like we've seen in previous years, lots to address, and we fully expect that going forward. I do think there's a psychological effect when identical sales are positive that cause people to be a little bit more rational than they might have otherwise been. But actually, when we saw a deflation a couple of years ago, behavior was -- for the most part, there were some moments, but for the most part, it was more rational. We called out a few times in the quarter calls where we saw some blips and differences, but generally, it wasn't too bad. And that was with deflation. But what you described and what we certainly are forecasting is not a deflationary environment but one that's just a little less inflationary than it is currently. And so I would not expect to see an environment that was much different than what we've been seeing, fiercely competitive but certainly rational.","W. Rodney McMullen","The only other thing I would add to that, Meredith, is we also expect the economy to improve a little bit, and we do think the improvement in the economy would help everybody's volume go up a little bit and spend on an item, a little more expensive items and those kind of things. So I think that is also in the background.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I have a question. You clearly are doing a very good job of managing expenses. The FIFO gross margin was up, which it hasn't been for a while. Is there any particular area of expense, shrink transportation, that stands out as a positive for you guys in 2011?","David B. Dillon","Yes, you want to comment on it, Rodney?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. One of the things we're really pleased about is it's really broad-based. And there isn't just one place where you can go and say half the savings is being created by this one item. It really is all across -- all the departments. Shrink results were very solid, our warehouse and transportation group did a nice job. And when you adjust for fuel, it's even better. If you look at our store teams, they did a very nice job of, and Dave mentioned it earlier, really identifying things to make work more efficiently, where the customer is not -- it doesn't benefit the customer, and then we reinvest some of that to help the customer, other places we help to invest in lower pricing. So it's really very broad-based, which is one of the things we're very pleased about.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And that's great. And my final question would be about the labor negotiations. I looked at the 8-K, and there was actually commentary that said there's a bunch of markets you're going to be renegotiating, and the negotiations are going to be challenging. I was just wondering if you could talk about what happened in 2011. And in general, because obviously, every market is different, how did the course of those conversations go between wages and health care and pension?","David B. Dillon","I'll let Rodney maybe comment in a second. But the language we used in the 8-K and that we use today is actually pretty consistent with how we've seen the world for a long time, that there's lots of pressures that need to be addressed. And on one hand, as an employer, we genuinely want to provide positive wages, good wages that are viewed in the market as good wages and good solid benefits. I mean, those things actually matter to us that we can provide that. At the same time, we recognize we have to be cost-competitive, and so we work hard on that. But that's not a new phenomenon. And the challenge of the negotiations is also not new because there are some structural legacy issues in contracts generally that need to be generally addressed. So as to the specifics, though, I'll let Rodney comment on that.","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. The only other thing, when you look at '11, I don't think there's anything specific. One of the things I've been very pleased with, the union and our labor negotiators is just sticking with it. Because the things that you've outlined, obviously, it's a great deal of difficulty. Dave outlined we want to make sure that we have a very solid wage benefit and health care benefit package that's extremely competitive in the marketplace. And I've really been impressed with everybody's commitment and persistence in just trying to keep talking about it, working through it, engaging our associates, trying to understand what really works and allows us to stay competitively. So that piece, I would give both parties high marks on sticking with it. But outside of that, I don't think there's anything unusual to talk about on '11. Obviously, as you look forward, you have the new health care laws that start changing a lot in 2013. And how that affects and what uncertainties that creates will be a lot of the discussion, I think, in '12, too.","David B. Dillon","Meredith, the pension agreement we reached last year is a really good example of what Rodney was describing, of people sticking with it, working through it, trying to find a way to make that all work. I think that took us, I don't know, 1.5 years...","J. Michael Schlotman","18 months.","David B. Dillon","To work through. Yes. So it just illustrates that point. That was a good question, though.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","If we looked at Fred Meyer and your jewelry store business separately in the quarter, fourth quarter, can you talk about how those businesses performed? And I'm thinking about what kind of seasonal kick they had versus management's expectations?","W. Rodney McMullen","If you look on the, I would say the grocery side, but it's broader than just grocery at Fred Meyer, it was phenomenal. When you look at the nonfood side and jewelry, I would say it was a solid year. If you look at our performance versus the publicly reported companies, we've outperformed most of those companies, so it was solid but it wasn't something that was spectacular. So overall, we felt really good about it. But it wasn't something that was just blow-away-good that it really drove the numbers in a different level.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Now when you say jewelry was solid or the nonfood side of Fred Meyer was solid, I think you described both as solid, was that upsales and earnings versus a year ago?","W. Rodney McMullen","Up on sales. If you look at the 2 combined, up on earnings -- not necessarily up on earning, jewelry would've been not up on earnings.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And then if you -- I want to go back to comps and look at it a different way. If you sort of took your households and divide it in 3 economic or demographic tranches, how were comps between high, low and middle groups?","David B. Dillon","Well, if you did it based upon their sensitivity to price, which is one of the ways we look at it, the tier that is most sensitive to price was challenged, and it's suffered disproportionately. And we think it's a direct result of retail prices on food being higher and them not having any more money in their wallet to spend. So the units went down and those numbers were not very pretty. All of the other segments were -- would've been good and strong and up and positive. We ought to also comment that corporate brands had a terrific quarter and a terrific year. We noted the 35% of grocery units, that's back up to the peak that we've ever achieved, and that's where we're just about 1.5 years or 2 ago.","J. Michael Schlotman","And that does sort of detemper the identical sales number, because it can be the same number of units, but it's a lower retail price. And that strong offering can actually show up in that way, and it may look like the ID number in a certain category is worse than it really is and you have to factor that in.","David B. Dillon","I agree with that. And let me add one other thing. This might give you a little bit of color. We've often identified a few categories or products or brands and so forth that have done well. And let me just highlight those and maybe a few others. We've, obviously, in several quarters past, talked about natural foods and organic produce, sushi, Boar's Head, Starbucks, prepared foods, all of those had really good results. But we would add to that list, floral -- and we had, by the way, a good Valentine's Day, a strong Valentine's Day. Greeting cards are actually up, cosmetics are up. Those are areas that we've seen some improvements in. And that would give you a little sense of the optimism that we have is that we're seeing a little broader customer recovery than what we'd seen before. But still that bottom group that is most price-sensitive is definitely a challenge right now.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If I take your comments there, Dave, just on the broader customer recovery and the quarter-to-date comp trends that are up, say, 5% and with the Express Scripts benefit coming in a little bit stronger so far, can you kind of help me triangulate back to that 3% to 3.5% comp guidance as we think about the full year?","David B. Dillon","Sure, I'd be happy to and Mike and Rodney may have some additional thoughts, too. But first, when you think about 3% to 3.5%, it could initially give you a feeling that we're not very optimistic about the year. But don't think that at all. In fact, it's just the opposite. Those numbers reflect a surprisingly high impact of moving some drugs off of patent and into the generic prescription world. And it is, quite frankly, impactful on our total company numbers. And that's the primary thing that's driving that. And so I want to make sure you see that we feel pretty optimistic about what this future looks like. It certainly includes our view that the economy is going to improve. It also includes our view that the customers' world is improving. And it includes our view that inflation will moderate a bit as we get later into the year. You want to add anything more to that, Mike?","J. Michael Schlotman","The other thing is, is that the 3% to 3.5% won't be smooth throughout the year. We expect higher numbers in the first part of the year, and it will decline as the year goes on as a result of what Dave said with those generics going off-patent. And there's a couple of reasons for that. I don't want this to be a pharmacy call, although Lincoln Lutz may like that, but the first 6 months that we have -- that those drugs go on off-patent, there is an exclusive generic provider, so that's a step down in sales a little bit. And then after 6 months, it steps down again. I don't mind sharing that specifically that impact that Dave talked about. Our estimate of the effect of the drugs coming off-patent and going to generic on our total book of business is 50 basis points. That's not 50 basis points on pharmacy sales, that's the overall reduction in business for the company. That doesn't really -- but they come at little bit of higher gross profit rate. And that's one of the reasons I went into the detail I did on explaining how the year is. So that's going to have a disproportionate effect in the back half of the year. But we don't believe our profits will suffer because the gross profit rate on those is higher. And it will stand a little counterintuitive to the model we've espoused for so long, but we're just trying to give some transparency into how we see the year shaking out.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. No, that's actually very helpful. And then just if I could follow up on the first quarter guidance, say, a little bit better than $0.70, $0.71 for EPS. If we think about, say, a high 4% comp and SG&A leverage consistent with what you did -- can you just help me out on the LIFO charge for 1Q? It would really appear that there's going to be another step-down on the core FIFO in 1Q. I just want to make sure if my view is correct.","J. Michael Schlotman","Yes. I don't think that's necessarily the case. That's potentially possible. But keep in mind, last year's first quarter was just a phenomenal quarter. Everything that could possibly go right went right. And my comment on the LIFO, when you look at where we were on LIFO early in the year last year, it's that kind of in the range or close to the range that we're expecting for the full year this year. So we had to increase our LIFO throughout the year in 2011. And so we won't get any benefit on earnings per share from a significantly lower -- or from a potentially lower LIFO charge until later in the year when we had to catch up the full year.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Kelly Bania actually in for Robby Ohmes. I was wondering if you kind of broadly look back at the year how you would characterize the level of price investments. Was it maybe above normal or normal? And as you think about next year, you talked about the external environment improving. What would you be planning in terms of price investments? And how could the benefit of the shift to generics possibly help fund some of that gross margin investment next year?","David B. Dillon","Well, let me first comment on last year. I feel like some of our investment in gross margin certainly was on price programs. But some of it was with a high rate of inflation. A higher rate of inflation tends to bring the gross profit rate down just a little bit, unless you try to chase the percentage, which we typically have not done. And that's a little part of it, too. So I wouldn't try to subscribe that all of the gross investment last year was purely based on our price programs and things we were trying to invest in like that. And as for this year looking forward, I think it would be very similar to that kind of thinking. I don't see it as a big difference, although I do think that the inflation's going to change a little, it will moderate a little bit. And so the impact from the inflation might be a little less pronounced during the year. Rodney, you want to add more color to it than that?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes. The only other thing I would add is I always think that you have to separate the grocery and drug\/GM departments away from the fresh departments in terms of meat, produce. And those departments are heavily influenced by commodity prices. And if you look at 2011, certainly from a commodity price inflation standpoint, it was significantly more than normal, which caused more-than-normal to get passed to the customer. But at the same time, there were times when we paid our fair share of that cost. So I really think you have to separate it into 2 buckets. And when you look at just the grocery departments in those, it was a pretty normal year. We would expect '12 to be pretty much staying along the same lines. On the fresh part of the business, that's much more commodity-driven.","Kelly A. Bania - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just another question on market share. Thanks for all the color there. I was wondering if you could elaborate on fourth quarter market share trends versus Walmart. I think you mentioned you were up 40 basis points for the year. Wondering if that's changed at all in the fourth quarter? It sounds like Walmart's getting a little more price-aggressive. I'm wondering if you saw that or if there was any change.","W. Rodney McMullen","We really don't talk about by quarter-by-quarter because when you look at it within quarters, and this has been true for the last, I don't know, 5 or 10 years or however long we've tracked it, a lot more variability across quarter-to-quarter just because how the quality of how people report the data and all that. So there's a lot more volatility from quarter-to-quarter, so we really don't talk about it. We felt very good about where we were across the year and by quarter. And that's really the only thing that I would talk about.","Operator","Your last question will come from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So Rodney, I think you said something really interesting with regards to -- the third quarter tonnage was essentially flat and slightly improving as you ended the year. Was there anything unique that you did at the end of 2011 to improve the tonnage, in your opinion?","W. Rodney McMullen","Nothing more than normal things that you would do. I mean, it really is trying to understand what's connecting and what's not and you modify along the way. But I wouldn't say it was one big, one item that caused it. I really think it's just you continue to learn and just getting a little bit better about on the things you're doing.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then also in the prepared remarks, there was a comment, loyal customers spend about 50% of their food dollars with Kroger and that there was opportunity to grow that. Are there any current initiatives focused specifically on growing that dollar with the loyal customers?","David B. Dillon","All of them. Rodney, do you want to add to that?","W. Rodney McMullen","Yes, I mean, I'm not going to be able to be any more insightful than what Dave is. There are a lot of things that we're doing. It really is -- if you think about a football analogy, it's one play at a time. And it's fascinating, those customers would tell us they spend more than what they actually spend with us. And it really is trying to understand each customer segment and what's important to them and delivering better against that.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, there was mention with regards to answering one of the questions that there's several technology projects that you're looking at that should be attractive for the long haul. Can you elaborate on what those might be?","J. Michael Schlotman","Probably wouldn't go into the list of them. But as you know, whenever you get into any kind of technology projects, they typically consume a bit of capital. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate amount allocated and budgeted for that, and it does affect where CapEx winds up coming in.","David B. Dillon","Thank you very much. And so before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. Because of your hard work in 2011, it was a big success. We made solid progress in connecting more with our customers, especially by offering better and faster service, and making sure that we have the products our customers want in stock. We worked hard to keep costs under control in ways that are meaningful to the business but not distracting to our customers. And we have successfully reinvested the costs that you saved. Our customers say that they can feel the difference. Thank you and keep up that great work.
