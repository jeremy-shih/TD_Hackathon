At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Chris, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m encouraged by the actions we\u2019ve taken and the progress we have made as we execute our turnaround plan. Customer perceptions of McDonald\u2019s have steadily improved over the past 18 months, and the third quarter marked five consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth across all business segments and many markets gaining share.","For the third quarter, global comparable sales increased 3.5%; operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Earnings per share rose 9% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of previously announced current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter increased 17% on constant currencies. Profitability has increased both for McDonald\u2019s and franchisees. At the restaurant level, franchisee cash flows reached all-time highs in many markets including the U.S. These results are testament to our diligent execution of the turnaround plan as we put customers at the center of everything we do. We are at a point where we\u2019ve begun to transition from a focus on revitalization to a mindset that\u2019s concentrated on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long term.","We expected performance through 2016 to be uneven and it has been. Markets such as the UK, Australia and Canada continue to grow sales and guest counts, whilst markets including the U.S., France and Germany work to overcome challenges of varying degrees.","We are mindful of the near-term headwinds we face, most notably in the U.S., as lap the very successful introduction of All Day Breakfast, which was immediately popular with customers. However, we are not managing the business quarter-by-quarter. In fact, our commitment to investing in the business is stronger now than ever. We\u2019ve taken action in the areas that matter most to customers.","In particular, we\u2019re placing significant emphasis on food quality, the customer experience and value to give people more reasons to visit McDonald\u2019s. We believe the long-term investments we are making in these areas provide the foundation on which we\u2019ll build as we work to be recognized as a modern progressive burger company by customers.","In the area of food, we\u2019re taking important steps in how our food is prepared and the ingredients we use. In the U.S., we completed our transition to chicken not treated with antibiotics important to human medicine a year ahead of schedule.","We introduced new buns that do not contain a high-fructose corn syrup. And we\u2019ve removed artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets, and customers have responded favorably to this news, and we\u2019ve seen sales accelerated as a result. Following the announcement, the sales of McNuggets increased nearly 10% and they\u2019re sustaining above previous levels.","We\u2019re also modernizing the customer experience in markets around the world as we evolve to the Experience of the Future. In Canada, we\u2019re engaging with customers in simpler, less stressful ways offering them more choices in how they order or pay. We now have dual point service and self-order kiosks in almost 90% of our traditional restaurants. In addition, we\u2019re taking steps to redefine hospitality on both sides of the counter with dedicated guest experience leaders in all of Canada\u2019s traditional restaurants.","Finally, value, a critical priority in all markets. In Germany for example, we\u2019ve deployed a two-pronged approach. First, we successfully added new layer to our value platform at mid-tier price points. At the same time, we\u2019re celebrating the quality and taste of our core products through strong marketing and promotional campaigns. These steps build on the new pricing structure we introduced earlier this year to strengthen our value platform, and that\u2019s resonating well with the price conscious German consumer.","The actions we\u2019re taking specific to our food, the customer experience and value and telling customers about the changes, all are making a difference. Customer satisfaction has improved significantly, up more than 6% year-to-date in both the U.S. and Canada with most major markets seeing improvements. This is a testament to the progress we\u2019ve made since we refocused on running better restaurants as part of our turnaround plan in May of last year.","With that context, let\u2019s turn to performance highlights in the market. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales remained positive for the third quarter, up 1.3%. Customers love All Day Breakfast and the way we\u2019ve continued to build on its success. Since its introduction last year, customers asked even more choices. So, we recently launched the second phase of All Day Breakfast. Expanded menu now includes muffins and biscuits, as well as our beloved McGriddles all-day in all U.S. restaurants.","At the same time, we\u2019re enhancing experience to adapt alongside customers\u2019 expectations. One of the most notable ways we\u2019re doing this in the restaurants is by better integrating technology in visible tangible ways. For example, more than 90% of U.S. restaurants now use digital menu boards. These new menu boards enable us to showcase the quality of our food with fresh photography. Because they\u2019re less congested and better organized, the menus now do a further job highlighting the board range of choices available. The menu boards are also smart; the robust content management system that we haven\u2019t even become tapping into yet. When fully enabled, we\u2019ll be able to adjust what to feature on the menu based on time of day or even weather conditions. We\u2019ll be more relevant to customers as we remind them about our ice cream cones and McFlurrys on a hot summer day, or a handcrafted hot McCaf\u00e9 beverages if it\u2019s chilly outside and they feel the need to warm up.","We also continue to emphasize value because we know how much budget-oriented customers count to McDonald\u2019s. Franchisees and customers alike have embraced the McPick 2 platform. They appreciate the choice and flexibility it provides. In September, we promoted McPick 2 for $5 nationally whilst other variations of McPick 2 were offered on local level. Some of our best performing regions offered beverage value to complement the McPick 2 platform. We\u2019ll continue to tap into these learnings both nationally and locally as we design future McPick offers.","Underpinning these efforts is a continued focus on running better restaurants. Our commitment to raising the bar with an emphasis on underperforming restaurants is making a difference. Customer satisfaction scores have improved the most for our bottom quintile restaurants. And we\u2019ve cut the customer satisfaction score gap between the top and bottom quintile performance nearly in a half through our efforts provide a better, more consistent experience for customers in every restaurant, every time they visit.","Turing to the International Lead market segment. Third quarter comparable sales were up 3.3%, driven by positive performance across four of the five major markets with France being exception. The UK, Australia and Canada delivered yet another quarter of comparable sales and guest count growth. These markets share similar elements that underly [ph] their strong track records of success.","Contemporary restaurants designs with over 90% of restaurants reimaged. Compelling menu strategy is tailored to local customer tastes, such as the Spice it Up event in Canada featuring Spicy Sriracha sauce on a country chicken or Angus beef sandwich. And modern service experience that incorporates the elements of Experience of the Future to provide customers with more choice and flexibility in how they order, what they order and how they are served. These elements amplify each other to create a notable difference by customers who then reward us by visiting more often.","I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we made in Germany, which I had a chance to experience firsthand while I visited the team their last quarter. Comparable sales were positive in the market for the third quarter.","Earlier, I mentioned the steps we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our value platform. Combined with strong promotions featuring customer favorites like the Hamburger Royale with cheese, these actions are making a difference and getting us back on track to grow top line results once again. That said, I want to stress that growing guest counts remains a top priority. That\u2019s the key to winning back the share we\u2019ve lost in recent years.","In France, third quarter comparables sales were negative. This was driven in large part by ongoing macroeconomic challenges including a declining GDP, high unemployment and the continuing concerns of personal safety, which is impacting both inbound tourism as well as the French consumer. The customers appreciate the actions we\u2019ve taken to strengthen our value offer including further extensions of the well-regarded and successful Petite Plaisirs value platform.","We\u2019re also satisfying French consumers growing appetite for premium burgers through strong promotional campaigns featuring customer favorites like the 280 Burger and the Big Tasty. In addition, we\u2019re introducing a new signature line of sandwiches in our Experience of the Future restaurants to customers even more great tasting burger choices at convenience and value they come to appreciate at McDonalds.","In the High Growth segment, third quarter comparable sales were up 1.5% driven by positive performance in Russia and most other markets, partially offset by negative comparable sales in China.","Whilst third quarter comparable sales in China was down 1.8%, results improved as the quarter progressed. Excluding the impact of temporary protests surrounding recent events related to the South China Sea, China\u2019s comparable sales would have been positive for the quarter. A strong focus on enhancing convenience through greater integration with third-party delivery providers combined with aggressive core menu sampling events designed to offset the impact of the protests contributed to market share gains amidst a still challenging macroeconomic environment.","In Russia, the economy remains difficult as consumer purchasing power continues to decline. Despite these challenges, we\u2019re growing comparable sales and guest count, and gaining market share. Specifically, our performance is a result of a heightened focus on value as well as the successful marketing campaigns to grow the breakfast daypart.","And I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention Japan where comparable sales increased 17.7% in the third quarter. Diligent execution of the market\u2019s comprehensive turnaround plans, which include strong promotions, exciting menu variety, compelling value and a more modern restaurant experience is enhancing McDonald\u2019s relevance to customers and contributing to sustained momentum in this market.","As we look to the future, we recognize the importance of having the right structure, the right people, a common focus, and lastly, greater accountability across the entire McDonald\u2019s system. We\u2019ve taken steps forward in all four areas to set the proper foundation for long-term growth.","First, the right structure. Building on last year\u2019s shift to segments of similar markets, we took further steps in the third quarter to transition to a leaner, more efficient and more nimble organization. This will enable us to better share expertise, improve efficiencies and drive down costs, taking greater advantage of our size and scale. Kevin will provide further details in a moment.","Second, the right talent. An important component of our turnaround plan has always been to ensure we have the right people in the most critical positions. Management changes have been and continue to be an anticipated part of the process. That\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on a blend of promoting individuals who are ready to take on additional responsibilities, continuing to develop leaders; they have the right skills necessary to grow the business, and attracting new executives, into the business to provide fresh energy and innovative thinking. I am confident in the recent selections we have made. This includes Chris Kempczinski succeeding Mike Andres as President of McDonald\u2019s USA, effective the 1st of January. As part of a thoughtful transition, Chris is already spending significant time with Mike and our franchisees in the field.","In the High Growth segment, Joe Erlinger has made an immediate impact upon stepping into the role of President in these markets. He knows these markets well having been CFO of the segment and the former Managing Director of Korea.","Third, a common focus. In addition to making forward progress on running great restaurants, we\u2019re putting greater emphasis on acceleration initiatives that will bring more customers into our restaurants more often. This includes the Experience of the Future, which we\u2019re looking to roll out with greater speed in the U.S., and we look forward to sharing more details of those plans as they\u2019re finalized.","And lastly, accountability. We\u2019ve made great progress executing our turnaround plan. Now, we\u2019re starting to balance those efforts with a greater focus on longer term growth. We\u2019ll take all of our franchisees, employees and suppliers working together and holding each other accountable to achieve our ultimate goal of becoming the modern, progressive burger company. We have a long term view on our potential and the opportunities that exist. I\u2019m confident in the actions we\u2019re taking to run better restaurants and the investments we\u2019re making. We\u2019re getting the right people, foundations, and platforms in place to properly grow the business and reassert McDonald\u2019s global brand leadership. Thanks very much. And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. We\u2019re pleased with our third quarter results. By staying keenly focused on our customers, we maintained positive momentum while continuing to make meaningful strides toward building a better McDonald.","Since Steve talked about sales and earnings per share, I\u2019ll focus on margins and G&A. I\u2019ll also provide an update on the key outlook items and the recent progress we\u2019ve made against our financial targets.","Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter. Franchise revenues continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our revenue stream as we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization. For third quarter, franchise revenues increased 6% in constant currencies, reflecting strong comparable sales and the impact of refranchising. For the quarter, franchise margin dollars exceeded $2 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over a $100 million to our growth in global operating income. This solid performance reflects sales-driven improvements across all segments, led by results in the International Lead markets.","In addition, we maintained strong global franchise margins of over 82%. These results are a testament to the benefits of transitioning toward a more predictable and stable revenue stream. Growth in Company-operated margins also contributed about $75 million to our growth in global operating income, as Company-operated margins rose to more than $730 million, an 11% increase in constant currencies. Company-operated margins climbed 260 basis points with the U.S. and China leading the overall improvement. Our emphasis on running better restaurants from enhanced conveniences to tighter operating controls is yielding a better experience for our customers, as well as improved restaurant profitability.","In the U.S., the Company-operated margin percent increased 450 basis points for the quarter, reflecting positive comparable sales and a favorable commodity environment. These results also reflect a benefit from our refranchising as we optimize our Company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution it makes to our bottom-line.","Moving on to G&A. At the end of last year, we noted that we expected to realize about $150 million in savings during 2015 and 2016 with about half of the savings to be achieved in each year. For third quarter, our G&A expenses increased 1% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be relatively flat in constant currencies. However, excluding incentive-based compensation, G&A for the year is expected to be down about 3% in constant currencies, which equates to roughly $75 million in savings due to lower employee-related costs, resulting from our restructuring initiatives. This will bring our total G&A savings at the end of 2016 to at least $150 million.","Let me switch gears now for an update on menu pricing and commodity costs. In the U.S. commodity costs declined by more than 6% during the third quarter. Given the strength of our third quarter savings combined with our outlook for fourth quarter, we now expect the segment\u2019s full year basket of goods to be down 4.5% to 5%. Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the third quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat for the remainder of this year.","While we continue to benefit from favorable commodity costs around the world, we continue to experience rising labor costs in many of our markets. These pressures are considered as we made pricing decisions over the course of the year. Our objective is to manage pricing in a way that maintains our strong value proposition, contributes to guest traffic growth, and supports restaurant profitability.","In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3.5% compared with food-away-from-home inflation of about 2.5%. For U.S. Company-operated restaurant pricing, our goal is to approximate food-away-from-home inflation over time. So, we maybe a little higher or lower in any given quarter. We are also mindful that the current 450 basis-point GAAP between the costs of eating at home versus dining out is the largest spread in more than 30 years and maybe impacting consumer behavior. We continue to track these metrics and expect our overall menu price increase at year-end to be more in line with food-away-from-home inflation. For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged about 2%.","Next, I\u2019d like to provide an update on our foreign currency outlook. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.01 to $0.02 in the fourth quarter, which would bring the full year impact to $0.09 to $0.10. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.","Last quarter, I committed to providing more detail on today\u2019s call regarding the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our previously announce G&A savings targets. For the last several months, we have been working with outside advisors to thoroughly analyze our G&A spending an organizational structure from our corporate functions to the individual markets and the critical role they play in the field.","Our overall goal was to focus our resources and talent and customer-facing activities that drive business growth, while creating a more globalized system that more effectively leverages our size and scale to spread learnings better and drive cost improvements and efficiencies.","As we move toward becoming a leaner and more agile organization. We\u2019re positioned to make quicker and better decisions and to execute on our strategic intent to create a better customer experience. The pace at which All Day Breakfast moved from the U.S. to Australia is a great example of how we\u2019re accelerating knowledge transfer across the system to benefit customers globally. I am confident that our redesigned organization is now better equipped to adapt to today\u2019s rapidly changing environment.","As a result of our reorganization, we incurred roughly $80 million in restructuring charges for the third quarter. While this component of our restructuring is nearing completion, we do expect to incur some additional but less significant charges in the fourth quarter. We remain on track to achieve our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million by 2018 with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of next year.","We also continue to make changes to the business through our global refranchising efforts. Since the beginning of 2015, we refranchised nearly a 1,000 restaurants including a 140 in the third quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to date have been sold to existing conventional franchisees. As previously indicated, we\u2019re also actively pursuing a transaction in China where we are currently in the process of vetting a select number of qualified bidders.","In addition, we have made meaningful progress in our search for long-term strategic partners in Malaysia and Singapore. These markets collectively operate almost 400 restaurants, more than 80% of which are Company-owned. We are in the final stages of the process and expect to complete these transactions by the end of this year.","Given where the transactions stand, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $40 million in the quarter to account for historical currency losses. As we moved into the month of October, we also completed the sale of 75 Company-operated restaurants in the euro region of Russia to an existing developmental licensee. The results of this transaction will be reflected in fourth quarter. So, we remain on track to refranchise about 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018, and will continue to keep you apprised of our progress.","Last November, we increased our three-year cash return to shareholders target to $30 billion by the end of 2016. During the quarter, we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Share repurchases for the quarter totaled $2.7 billion, the vast majority of which was completed under our second accelerated share repurchase program of the year. Further, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 6% dividend increase effective in the fourth quarter, the equivalent of $3.76 annually. This increase marked the Company\u2019s 40th consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders. As a result of these activities, the cumulative cash return under our three-year target stands at nearly $28 billion and we are on track to complete the remaining amount by the end of this year.","To summarize, over the course of the last year, we\u2019ve demonstrated our commitment to meeting our financial targets. By the end of 2016, we will have met our $30 billion cash return to shareholders target, achieved nearly one-third of our G&A savings target and completed more than one-third of our restaurant refranchising with some significant transactions on track for completion in 2017.","We continue to measure our progress and hold ourselves accountable in each phase of the turnaround to ensure that we are appropriately allocating our resources to strategic operating plans that will grow our business. As we move in to the final quarter of 2016, we are mindful of the hurdles we face in the near-term but we\u2019re keeping our line of sight clearly focused on the long-term. Through our actions, we\u2019re unlocking financial value and using it to fuel the innovation and investments that will create a better customer experience and deliver sustained profitable growth for the long-term for our system and our shareholders. Thanks.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Question-And-Answer Session","A - Chris Stent","Thanks Kevin. We will now open the call for analysts and investor questions. The first question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. A question on the U.S. A common perception of McDonald\u2019s U.S. is that All Day Breakfast and McPick 2, the value message, these are the real the big two and they are running out of gases, sales drivers. There is not a lot else going on -- and at least this is a common perception. Perhaps you can comment on these two initiates. And relatively, can you comment on the inventory of tested marketing renovation, innovation value as you look into 2017, are you getting better visibility on U.S. growth? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Hi, David. Steve, I\u2019ll take this one. So, first of all, on the All Day Breakfast and McPick 2, so that was the -- they are two of the foundational elements of what\u2019s helped maintain and -- establish and then maintain momentum of the business. So, as you know, All Day Breakfast around this time last year, it served us well. As you know, the initial peak was higher than we expected and it settled down to a level that we are very happy with. In the meantime, we worked on how can we extend that platform both operationally and making sure the consumer demand was there and they extended it just a couple of weeks ago as well, three or four weeks ago. So that is here to stay, is doing well for us and is a foundational element of our business momentum.","Similarly, it really is well-embraced by both our operators and by our customers. So, as you know, we tried both, McPick 2 for 5, which is typically the platform we use at a national level and we\u2019ll be bringing that back, I don\u2019t know, three, four times a year and hitting at a national level and so using the flexibility of that platform to rotate different items through that menu. But, what you don\u2019t see perhaps so visibly is across the regions is how the Pick 2 is always on. And typically the regions will use a greater value element like a McPick 2 for 2.50, McPick 2 for 2, McPick 2 for 3, and again depending on seasonality and the customer preference we\u2019ll rotate products through there. So, both those platforms are good contributors to us and are important part of our business going forward.","In terms of what we\u2019ve got to be excited about going forward, there\u2019s plenty and the part of what we\u2019re enjoying about the new structure in this business is the greater visibility we have to what works around the world and what\u2019s creating some of that success internationally for us, but also the way that they\u2019ve simplified the structure in the U.S., what\u2019s working on a regional level. So, there is a lot of product innovation, local product innovation at regional level, but we\u2019re looking to learn from and lift where appropriate.","Earlier this quarter, I spent some time in Phoenix and Scottsdale in Arizona, and then went up to Portland in Oregon, and one common success factor in both those regions, both of them are the strongest sales regions we have in the U.S. currently, and what was also particularly successful there was they were complementing local beverage value alongside the McPick 2 platform alongside fundamentals of running better restaurants. So, there are these pockets of great success that we\u2019re looking to lift and localize and then launch rapidly.","But the other piece that I always come back to and I won\u2019t hesitate to coming back to is probably the most important element of what has established momentum in the U.S. is the operational improvements around running better restaurants. And that is something that is so, so fundamental, and it may not be a headline grabber. So, if you think about the 27, 28 million customers that come in every single day, if we can offer a more consistent, friendlier, more convenient service to them that is where our greatest reward is. And the customer satisfaction scores are going in significantly right direction. And again, we have a number of ways we\u2019re looking to improve the operational experience including using technology to make it more easier and more convenient for customers.","So, we have multiple future growth drivers. And internationally, again, we\u2019re scanning the horizon, clearly. I mean, you\u2019ve seen the success of the very -- very consistent solid success across the International Lead markets, and there are certain common success stories across those, most notably how they\u2019re embracing what they\u2019re calling and describing the Experience of the Future, which is how we use modern facilities are totally redefined, front of house hospitality experience, use of technology with self order kiosks for example, integrating that with mobile apps and again offering a degree and appropriate degree of customization for customers so they can really exert their choice and enjoy variety across our menu. So, again, you can expect us to incorporate some of those successes into the U.S. business as we move forward.","Chris Stent","Next question\u2019s from Andrew Charles of Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Two questions from me. I don\u2019t think you shared the [Technical Difficulty] sandwich and you commented on the past on the consistency of that gap. So, can you disclose the number and also the cadence of the 3Q? And then, Steve, with the departure of several key leaders from the senior team combined with the focus on becoming more nimble, reach faster decisions, can you talk about the bench of talent that remains following these changes? I know obviously you mentioned new executives coming in for fresh perspectives but anything more to just give assurance around the changes would be helpful.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, sure. First of all, on the gap, competitive gap, we had a positive gap for the quarter. Positive gap was 0.6%. As you know, it\u2019s a market shift I tell that really is a scramble. There is certainly a softening top-line across the sector with consumer confidence. All of us in this sector would prefer some tailwinds. If you look out, there aren\u2019t many tailwinds at the moment. There is not great economic growth to help provide a lift; consumer confidence is muted. We\u2019re at a rather unusual stage of the election cycle. So, none of that\u2019s really providing a tailwind for us.","That said, there is a significant market out there and we\u2019re going to keep battling for market share. That said, seeing the softening of the gap, there is not a great surprise to us, because it was a particular -- this time last year and heading into the fourth quarter, had [ph] a really strong performance for us. So, the reality is the trends we\u2019re seeing are no surprise to us and certainly aren\u2019t shaking us from our longer term objectives.","From a leadership perspective, I\u2019d like to talk about it. I\u2019m exciting about where we\u2019re at. We\u2019re heading into 2017 with really a world-class team that one would expect for world-class business; we have made changes. And as you go through the various phases of a turnaround into growth, there are times when the skill sets required, as we transition, also need to change. So, it\u2019s a delicate balance between leveraging experience, the knowledge, the tenure, the understanding of the system with our more tenured leaders also bringing innovative thinking. But, I can just draw some examples to this. I mean, giving Chris Kempczinski the opportunity and lead the U.S. business, I\u2019m really excited about. Because the reality is whilst he has somewhat limited McDonald\u2019s experience, a, he brings some phenomenal external leadership experience from global brands, consumer brands which will be valuable to us. But also let\u2019s not forget that it would take the five or six keys [ph] to direct reporting, he has reporting on this, more than 120 years of McDonald\u2019s U.S. experience amount. [Ph] So, I think we\u2019ve got the McDonald\u2019s experience piece covered with his fresh thinking. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be a very, very perfect combination.","If you look at the role that we\u2019ve created with Doug Goare now, I mean Doug has been around the best part of 40 years. And there are very few roles in this business that Doug hasn\u2019t field. He\u2019s had functional leadership, supply chain functional leadership, franchising, real estate as well as field leadership both here in the U.S., previously ran Europe and now he is proving to be a great leader of our International Lead markets.","Leveraging Doug\u2019s experience to help blend in with the new experience by Chris, we are one team and that\u2019s a good balance. Joe Erlinger taken the High Growth. I mean Joe started up in U.S. business 15 years ago, again a regional manager very successfully here in U.S. transitioned to become a market leader and Managing Director of the Korean market, has financial experience and became the CFO in the newly formed High Growth market and is perfectly placed to step in and add his energy and insight into leadership position.","And then, if you were to talk about for Chris\u2019s transition, we\u2019d already prepared for that, we\u2019d already had Lucy Brady come and join our business. She is a Senior Vice President of BCG; 20 years experience in helping global businesses develop growth strategies; so, ideally placed to seamlessly fit into that. So, it\u2019s an important balance; it\u2019s something that I enjoyed leading when I was in the UK when we were transitioning from probably a McDonald\u2019s only management team to one I felt had the right combination. And getting that balance right now is critical. And I am really excited to be into next year with the team that\u2019s sharp and ready to go ahead.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy","If you could just share a little bit more on the macro thoughts with what you are seeing, not just in China and the Asian regions and the U.S. but also Europe, just a little bit more on where you are seeing the strength in the four core markets?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, sure, absolutely. Really it\u2019s a fascinating time to be running international business, it really. Because if you speak to the team in France for example who have led so much for our strategic thinking and the innovation across our business, they\u2019re now facing really -- not an unforeseen, but previously not experienced challenges. And given not just their macroeconomic environment, we know that GDP is down in France but the different dynamics and given some of the situation and the security, terror situations they faced there, it really is creating some very significant dynamic changes in that market. Tourism, which has always been a substantial part of this fuel of the economy in France has really softened. And you see it in the hotel bookings and you can see impacted in certainly the more tourist areas where it\u2019s the Southern France or Paris within our business where we do have a heavy concentration of restaurants. But you\u2019re also seeing effect of the way that consumers live their lives, French consumers. So, there is a slight reticence to go into high density tourist areas because they\u2019re slightly concerned at environment.","Now, I think some of those things are temporary and some of the things maybe slightly more permanent. But it certainly means our management teams in France having to be much more agile and responsive to act in accordance with consumer sentiment. When you go to a market like Spain where they have probably suffered more through the economic crisis than any other market that we do business in, youth unemployment up at 25% for example, so we have just gently slowed down the new store opening there and also focused our efforts and our investment on existing store portfolio. And I\u2019m delighted with the progress that market\u2019s made as it\u2019s built its momentum, is returning to grow through the second half of this year and the outlook looks very confident.","UK is probably a well and -- an often spoken story. I think its 42 consecutive quarters of growth now and that momentum really does look very solid and well baked in. So, I won\u2019t say too much more about that. But then you can go internationally across to Asia. China is a challenging market. And the manner in which the teams are adapting to the variations that they have to experience, both getting in consumer sentiment and the broader economy is admirable. As they are seeing, just as one example, they now have a substantial part of their business is the delivery business. And not just -- originally we set up and established our own McDonald\u2019s delivery service and that proved to be very successful. We\u2019re now integrating into third party delivery providers and that has way further accelerated our momentum in business and customer satisfaction, as more people are getting used to ordering and eating at home. So, we are seeing different trends around the world.","And the one thing that\u2019s particularly beneficial to us now is as we remove some of the layers in our business, the visibility we have into what\u2019s going on and how we can transfer that knowledge and use it to our advantage in other markets. And part of the advantage of having Chris in this position now, he spent his first year travelling around the world, both with myself, with other senior leaders and on his own facing these markets, seeing what\u2019s going on, understanding the big levers of our business and is now perfectly placed to help take over the U.S. business. ","Chris Stent","Next question is Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.","Matthew DiFrisco","Just had a question with respect to the context of pricing of 3.5, and obviously that gap that you noted, so historic level between food-at-home. I wonder can you talk about how does that translate into the promotional environment that you\u2019re seeing now and perhaps going forward. I think this time last year, everyone was sort of getting into the 499 meal offerings and trying to promote heavily but obviously your margins are strong and you\u2019re taking price. Should this be a read that the promotional environment though still existing is not as heavy maybe or going forward?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, Matt. Thanks for the question. I\u2019d say you can see out there, there is still some promotional offerings certainly around the industry. I think all of us certainly including us would like to see kind of just a stable platform where you can -- that\u2019s why we put McPick 2 in. The idea is to have an ongoing value platform that customers can count on and not have to come up with some discounted promotion, if you will, every now and then. On the pricing side, to your point, right now we\u2019re a little bit ahead of food-away-from-home and we certainly experienced very favorable margins here in the U.S. in the third quarter. Some of that is the timing of when we take pricing. So, if you look at last year, we actually took some pricing in October whereas this year, we took it in September. So that when you look at a year-over-year basis, you have a little timing shift. There is about 70 to 75 basis points of pricing that would be in last year\u2019s fourth quarter that we may not replace some or all of that in the fourth quarter this year, which would bring some of our pricing down and maybe more in line with food-away-from-home. But we still do keep an eye on both food-away-from-home and food-at-home, which you mentioned is -- the food-at-home is extremely low right now. Thanks. ","Steve Easterbrook","Just to add to that, what I would say is we\u2019re trying to get the right balance, that is we build our plans. But we don\u2019t want to have a price-led strategy; we want to have an experience-led strategy of which value is a critical component. And our teams, as we look over the immediate term through 2017 through the three-year plan, that is the fundamental basis of how we\u2019re building our plan. Yes, value but we don\u2019t want to be price-led. And we can see some in the sector being drawn that way; that\u2019s not the place we really want to have.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird. ","David Tarantino","Steve, my question is on the U.S. business. I think you mentioned several times about the short-term headwind associated with cycling, the launch of All Day Breakfast. And while I understand you want to focus on the long-term, I think investors are very focused on how you might lap that initiative this quarter and next quarter. So, I was wondering if you\u2019d be willing to share how the business is trending currently or how you think Q4 and Q1 might play out given that very unusual comparison.","Steve Easterbrook","As you say David, it is an unusual comparison. So, we entered this period with our eyes wide open. And as we say, look, we are mindful of where the performance spiked last year. I can assure you, we\u2019re not building tactical plans to try and hit a comp in a given month or a given quarter. We are building for the long-term and not getting shaken up our strategy. So, we will still fight for market share at local level. We\u2019re going to leverage All Day Breakfast through quarter four into quarter one. We\u2019ve got some exciting promotional activity in quarter one that we\u2019re looking forward to. So, we\u2019re not sitting on our hands here but at the same-time nor are we going to get drawn into a year-on-year comp strategy at all. So that\u2019s the visibility I\u2019m happy and open to share with you, but not getting into predicting comps.","Chris Stent","Next question\u2019s from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Steve, I know you said in the U.S. you\u2019re going to update us later on your progress on the Experience of the Future, but do you think it\u2019s going to be a meaningful or could be a meaningful driver to the U.S. business in 2017? And what are the things that need to happen in order to implement that? I know remodels for example is a key part of that. So, where are you now on remodels, have you been sort of remodeling quietly behind the scenes and maybe some update on what needs to happen in order for Experience of the Future to be rolled out fully?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks John. I say it\u2019s starting to make the contribution in 2017. I mean the reality is we would see this as something like a three-year program, which is exactly what we\u2019re seeing through the markets like UK, Canada, Australia. These are rolling programs and actually give us growth upon growth upon growth. For the UK for example, they\u2019re already almost 40% converted to the entire Experience of the Future, which is introducing the technology along with the hospitality as well as the food elements. And therefore, their visibility on year-on-year growth of next two to three years looks pretty strong. In the U.S., we\u2019re certainly early in that cycle. In terms of modernized restaurants, it\u2019s just over 50% of the U.S. state is modernized; we\u2019ve got some work to do to complete that. And then of course within that we want to layer on top of the other elements, the broader [ph] elements, consumer facing elements of Experience of the Future, integrating that into the self order kiosk, offering different ways that customers can be served, they can place their orders, they can customize their food. So, we expect to start seeing that wrapped up through 2017 and literally the minute you convert the restaurant, we see a sales lift. So, yes, it\u2019ll be a contributor, but we\u2019ll probably be getting that full rate through 2018 and 2019 as well, which I think is a very strong program.","One of the things we have benefited from is, we\u2019ve learnt a lot of what works, also one or two things that don\u2019t work in the markets that we nearly adopted, Australia, Canada for example. So, we can bring that best practice into the U.S, make sure it\u2019s locally relevant and then go hard at it. So, we\u2019re really excited. The barrier to it is really -- is just a collective will to invest. I mean, there is an investment element to it over an operator level helping the company, and certainly from a company perspective we\u2019re allocating our capital to provide significant support alongside the operators to co-invest with them and we\u2019re really -- at the moment the U.S. cash flows are all time high. That means their ability to invest never have been greater. So,. I think we\u2019re in a good place.","Chris Stent","Next question\u2019s from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Hi, thank you. I have a follow-up and then a separate question. One, just on the pricing, the follow-up is you\u2019re talking about rolling off. To the extent that you know kind of what elasticity looks like in your business, is there any sense that maybe by allowing to roll off your traffic could accelerate in the sense that traffic has been negative and maybe the higher prices is a contributor to that so that we could see that composition change a little based on what you know about your customers? And then my second point is -- second question is about the unit growth, taking it down. Is that because you\u2019re intentionally steering more capital to existing unitary models, or is there something in the markets that you\u2019re seeing that would suggest kind of a slower pace of unit growth is appropriate? Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Sara. Let me hit both of those. The pricing, it\u2019s a fair point. As I mentioned, there is a lot of elements of pricing. What we try and balance is certainly restaurant profitability with continuing to grow guest counts. So, we\u2019ve talked about our main focus being growing guest count certainly in the U.S. And again, as I mentioned, the pricing is a little bit of a timing issue. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise to see that come down a little bit, which could help then accelerate some of the guest count growth.","Regarding unit growth, we brought it down by around 100. I think we had a 1,000, about a 1,000 last quarter; now, we said about 900. It\u2019s a little bit in various markets, a few in China, few in Spain, nothing of significance I would say. The reallocation is really to some of these investment areas that Steve was just talking about, certainly in places like Australia and the UK where we\u2019re implementing Experience of the Future seeing good sales lifts from those investments; we continue to reinvest in those types of investments. So, you saw the capital didn\u2019t come down; it was really a reallocation of a little bit of the new store openings to some of that reinvestment to continue to grow sales.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Good morning. One of your larger QSR\/coffee peers reiterated guidance the other day and they really kind of implied stable or positive fourth quarter comp trends. So, I\u2019m wondering if this is a case for the QSR industry overall. What does it seem like to your team? It seemed relatively better and if so why? And then, part B, if I may. How do you want us to think about\u2026","Steve Easterbrook","Nicole, sorry to interrupt. Could you just repeat that? The line is muffled. You talk about a competitor with\u2026","Nicole Miller Regan","I\u2019m so sorry. Let me pick up my headset.","Steve Easterbrook","Please repeat that. It would be great.","Nicole Miller Regan","I apologize. So, one of your larger QSR\/copy peers reiterated guidance earlier this week implying positive or just stable fourth quarter comp trends. And I\u2019m wondering if you and your team feel like this is the case for the QSR industry overall. And if things do seem relatively better for the entire industry, why now? And then part B, as analysts, how do you want us to think about and model that in comparison to your very difficult U.S. comp comparison in the prior year? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","I\u2019ll take the first one. So, we plan our business to grow on a global basis. So, growth is fundamental, both clearly at the global level but also at a local level with our owner operators. Our rich history of continuing to grow this business over 60 odd years through changes in -- societal changes as well as competitive environments as well as different economic backgrounds, we have proven to be pretty a resilient business. So, certainly as we go through quarter four and into quarter one, yes, we\u2019re planning to grow our business. Now, there\u2019s going to be ebbs and flows within the global business on where those pockets of success happen and that is why our geographic diversification is one of our great advantages. But we\u2019re planning to grow our like-for-like sales and we see that as being the life of our business as we look out over the medium to long term as well.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","Just shifting to the capital structure. What was your rent-adjusted leverage ratio at the end of the third quarter? And theoretically, where could you guys take it and still maintain that investment grade credit rating?","Chris Stent","Jeff, this is Chris, I\u2019ll be happy to give that back to you offline. We don\u2019t have those numbers in front of us.","Kevin Ozan","I guess what I would say is we are kind of -- we\u2019re certainly in the middle of BBB+ right now, have a little bit of room but not a lot of room, and we\u2019re committed to remaining at that BBB+ rating. And so as we look at any further debt addition, we keep in mind kind of wanting to stay at that existing credit rating. So, that\u2019s our intent certainly.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley","Two questions, both kind of follow-ups on previous discussions. I\u2019m curious, in your point of view that gap in the food-at-home inflation versus food away-from-normal inflation is part -- or the reason why restaurant sales -- and I\u2019m talking industry-wide, not on McDonald\u2019s are relatively soft. And then secondly going back to the questions on the U.S. future of the experience. If you have the same sheet of what elements you would try to include in that and is the U.S. in particular challenged because the driving [ph] percentages is so high in absolute terms or relative to other markets?","Steve Easterbrook","The gap clearly plays a role but it\u2019s not the reason for the broader softening, it\u2019s not the sole reason. So, I think it is an element. But when you are lower average check business like we are, I don\u2019t think that magnifies out the same as if we were a mid scale dining or fine end dining. So, yes it\u2019s probably in the mix but it\u2019s certainly doesn\u2019t explain. I think there are broader macroeconomic issues of consumer confidence and just uncertainty of wage increases, the slight squeeze on discretionary spend with gas prices aging back up and healthcare costs going back up. So, I think those are sort of things that we see affecting customers and basically the spare cash they have in their pocket.","Regarding Experience of the Future, I mean one of the great learns we\u2019ve had and particularly with launching so aggressively in Australia over year and a half ago which the main food element was something we described as create your taste and that was an in-store only premium food offering. Now, it worked great but we wanted to find a way that we could take that to our entire customer base. So, with Aussie team we worked on solutions now, what we can now bring. So, we believe there would be food elements customizing premium quality food that we can deliver through both the drive through and in-store. And I think that\u2019s one of the benefits we have of getting those early adopter, in our case going aggressive, learn, bring it back over and localize it and launch it. And so we believe we have a good solution for that. ","Chris Stent","Last question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Just a couple of follow-ups, if I may, firstly on G&A, I think that Kevin made the comment regarding that you guys have recently -- you brought in some third party consultants that were helping you to thoroughly evaluate the organizational structure. I wondered, do you think there might be some opportunity beyond the previously announced $500 million with some of that work that\u2019s recently coming in? And then secondly, if I may, there have been a lot of conversations on and off regarding your capital budget. What is the direction of CapEx for the business, new units and existing units over 2017 and 2018, if there is an initial direction we can get?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, thanks John. Let\u2019s start with the G&A. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve been spending some time certainly as an organization looking through, I\u2019ll say everything, our organization structure, our layers, the way we\u2019ve designed structures et cetera. And for now, what we\u2019ve agreed to is that we\u2019re going and reducing our G&A by just $500 million net. That still allows us to continue investing where we believe we need to, to continue to grow the business. So, we\u2019re very conscious of making sure that we\u2019ve got the right investment levels to be able to strategically still invest in the business. Might there be some opportunity beyond the 500, I guess, I\u2019d say we\u2019re not going to stop looking or stop having the discipline in the organization to continue managing the business appropriately. But there has been a lot of change in the organization in the near-term. And our belief is that for us right now, this is the right level for us to focus on in the near-term. I wouldn\u2019t say that that means we stop and then never kind of manage the business effectively going forward but for us right now the commitment is for the 500.","Regarding capital, right now, as you know we\u2019re right around $2 billion. What you may see in the near-term is as we convert some of these countries to development of licensees where we free up some of that capital, some of that maybe redeployed to the U.S. to spend on this Experience of the Future investment that Steve was talking about. So, you could see some reallocation of that capital in the next few years that would effectively keep our capital envelope relatively similar to what it is today. And then once that\u2019s complete, it\u2019s likely to go down after that. But in the near-term, we may reallocate some of the capital that we\u2019ve freed up to spending to accelerate that U.S. Experience of the Future investment.","Chris Stent","We\u2019re at the top of the hour, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Chris and again thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize our focus on giving people more reasons to visit McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019re committed to creating customer noticeable change across our business especially in the areas of food, experience and value and it\u2019s making a difference. Customer perceptions of McDonald\u2019s are improving and so is our performance. And moving in the right direction, we know there is much more work to do as begin to transition from our turnaround plan to mindset focused on strengthening the business to drive sustainable growth over the long-term. I am encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made and I\u2019m excited about the opportunities ahead as we begin to reinsert McDonald\u2019s as the global leader of the IEO industry. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call.

Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.","Mike Cieplak","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","With me on the call this morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Good morning.","We're pleased to be speaking to you today from our corporate headquarters in downtown Chicago, where we recently celebrated our one year anniversary in this contemporary urban facility.","Returning to Chicago was a deliberate move to get closer to our customers and the trend shaping business and society today. Our new facility was designed to be a modern and inspiring environment, a catalyst for our evolving culture.","Our move is also a metaphor for the momentum we're seeing across our business. Momentum has been building since we first launched our turnaround plan. As we've recently passed the four-year mark, I thought, it would be important to spend a few minutes reflecting on our journey.","Back in May 2015, I announced our initial steps to reset and rebuild our business, including our three-fold priorities of driving operational growth, returning excitement to our brands, and unlocking financial value.","At the time, we were keenly aware that the pace of change inside McDonald's is being eclipsed by the pace of change outside our business. We knew, we had to evolve with our changing market and consumer dynamics, and we knew incremental progress wasn't going to cut it. Returning to a growth company was going to require big, bold steps and greater personal accountability.","We knew success would be determined by the fast beating the slow, by choosing progress over perfection, and moving with a sense of urgency. So, we set out on the journey to become faster, smarter and more responsive to changing consumer expectations. We restructured to be closer to customers and faster at the point of impact. We refranchised to drive growth and bring greater insights at a local level. We increased accountability and financial discipline and returned cash to shareholders. Most importantly, we returned to operating growth. Indeed, within two years, we established a strong foundation, one that was fit for purpose, and brought the business to a place where we could begin accelerating growth again.","That led to the launch of our Velocity Growth Plan in March of 2017. The plan is rooted in building on the fundamentals that have served our Company so well for over 60 years. It's about running better restaurants, offering a compelling menu of delicious and affordable food, and complementing that with hospitality and convenience for our guests.","We know that when we create delicious, feel good moments for customers, every visit every day, customers recognize our efforts and reward us with repeat visits. We also know that we must continuously complement that work with big and powerful moves that keep us relevant and inviting for new generations of guests.","We deployed three accelerators to help us do just that, our Experience of the Future or EOTF; digital and delivery. With these efforts, we have focused on actions that have the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time. That's the path to becoming a better McDonald's.","Four years in, we did the hard work to put the Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators firmly in place, and we are energized by the broad-based strength in our results.","For the quarter, global comparable sales increased 6.5%, which marks four full years of quarterly comp sales growth. This was complemented by positive global comp guest counts.","During the quarter, we made strong gains in running great restaurants. We still have work to do, because speed of service is so important to our customers, seconds matter and impact decisions they make on repeat visits.","We're leveraging the power of the system, franchisees, suppliers and employees to reduce menu complexity, improve operational procedures, deploy new drive-thru crew competitions and incentives, adopt best practices for staffing, and leverage new technologies to make it easier for our teams to take responsibility for performance. And we're encouraged by the results we're seeing.","We set market level targets early this year and have dropped service times across many markets globally. They're providing a better experience for our customers, and with that seeing record high customer satisfaction scores this summer.","Here in the U.S., the plan we built with our franchisees is ambitious. Collectively, we recognized the need for change, and knew it\u2019d be hard work. We spent 2018, deploying major initiatives, including a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization, and the restructuring of U.S. field operations.","At the beginning of this year, we said 2019 would be a year to execute on running better restaurants and optimize the initiatives we deployed last year. In restaurant visits with franchisees around the country, I'm seeing the results of focused execution against the plan. Importantly, average franchisee restaurant cash flow has grown eight consecutive months through June, fully overcoming the decline we saw in 2018.","Across our International Operated Markets or IOM, we\u2019re seeing continued success. Consistent execution against the Velocity Growth Plan is a winning formula.","I had the pleasure to visit Italy during the quarter and witnessed firsthand a rigorous focus on operational innovations and improvements. Italy now has posted 10 consecutive quarters of comp sales and guest count growth with double-digit comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter.","In fact, Italy has outperformed the local Informal Eating Out or IEO category for nearly two years now. I saw similar energy and focus when I went from Italy to Poland, which also posted strong comp sales and guest count growth for the quarter. This high-performing market was an early adopter of EOTF and digital. In Warsaw, I saw the positive impact our guest experience leaders have on hospitality, as they greeted customers with a special warmth that made guests feel welcome.","Italy and Poland are great examples of markets where we start a best practice and replicate it at scale across other markets. Whether around EOTF rollout, hospitality, operations, or digital, ideas originate in one market and rapidly move to another, creating an environment where all boats rise.","Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper dive into our comp sales trends by market and performance drivers.","Kevin Ozan","Our top-line momentum remains strong. As Steve mentioned, global comp sales increased 6.5% for the quarter with each operating segment contributing meaningfully to our growth. In the U.S., comp sales were up 5.7%, our highest comp sales increase since the launch of all day breakfast back in the fourth quarter of 2015. And once again, we also grew comp sales across all dayparts.","Performance drivers for the quarter included proven value and deals such as our national 2 for $5 Mix & Match promotion, featuring our core menu items, as well as other locally relevant offers.","Our renewed focus on our iconic core menu, resonates well with our customers. Since switching the fresh beef for our Quarter Pound burgers just over a year ago, our sales results and positive customer response confirm it was the right strategic move.","In the first half of 2019, we sold over 55 million more Quarter Pound burgers compared to last year. A combination of both deal offers and line extensions, featuring bacon and DeLuxe builds on our classic Quarter Pounder with cheese helped to boost sales. Similar to last quarter, the sales benefit from our modernized EOTF restaurants contributed to our overall U.S. comp performance, which we expect to continue for the remainder of 2019.","By taking learnings from completed projects, we've successfully reduced construction downtime, and we're also recovering sales quicker, after reopening.","During the quarter, we converted an additional 600 restaurants to EOTF for a total of 1,000 projects completed in the first half of this year. We still expect to complete a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year.","Strong average check growth from both product mix and pricing continues to fuel our top-line in the U.S. We're seeing success with offerings that increase average check, traffic and cash flow, such as our current worldwide favorites, LTO. However, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains a top priority in the street fight for market share.","Turning outside the U.S. Strong balanced results continued across the International Operated segment with comp sales up 6.6% for the quarter. Each of the markets within the segment grew comp sales, and nearly all of the markets also grew comp guest counts. Strong results in the UK, France and Germany were key contributors to the segment\u2019s growth.","The UK marked its 53rd consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and increased market share versus our competition across all dayparts. Maximizing delivery was a key success factor for the market, along with menu innovation, such as the bacon roll breakfast sandwich and the Taste of America burgers LTO.","France has been successful with both its premium and core burger offerings, balanced with a compelling value platform, helping the market to again achieve record high market share. France now has nine consecutive quarters of both comp sales and guest count growth.","And Germany is maximizing contributions from EOTF, our core menu and strong value messages, all of which resonate with their customers. Germany also gained market share versus competitors, and customer satisfaction scores are up.","In the International Developmental Licensed segment, comp sales increased 7.9% with sales and guest count growth across each geographic region within the segment. Results across our three largest markets drove the strong sales performance with double-digit growth in Brazil, strong comps in Japan and positive performance in China. Accelerated new restaurant growth by our strategic partners, primarily in China, led the segment to grow system-wide sales by 10% for the quarter in constant currencies.","Now, I'll turn it back to Steve to further discuss the growth accelerators driving our global business.","Steve Easterbrook","Over the past four years, we've seen unprecedented changes in the global consumer landscape. With this proliferation of change, consumers today expect more from us. Quality, service and convenience are more important than ever. And of course, delicious food served by welcoming people is absolutely essential.","Accelerators of our Velocity Growth Plan are all about giving our global customers more control over how they order, how they pay, and how they serve their food.","In the U.S., we've made significant progress in modernizing our restaurants through our Experience of the Future initiative. We have now modernized over 8,500 U.S. restaurants. Today, customers are much more like to visit EOTF restaurants than they were just a year ago.","At the end of May, I was honored to join our team in New York for the opening of our new Time Square restaurant. Our three-storey restaurant is a major brand statement on how we're providing a better customer experience through d\u00e9cor, enhanced customer service and seamless order and pay technologies.","Our major IOM markets have had Experience of the Future for some time and we\u2019re continuing to unlock this potential. For example, in Australia and our major European markets, over 40% of in-store customers now use kiosks when dining with us, taking control of how they order, customize their food and select how to be served. From New York to Sydney and most places in between, our restaurants are not just ready for the future, they are meeting customers on their terms today.","Delivery is another area where we're taking bold action to meet customers\u2019 expectations for high quality food on their terms with increasing demands for convenience and speed. We've made significant progress on delivery the past two years and have room to grow in a largely untapped market with great upside. Driving customer awareness and trial about the McDelivery remains a top priority.","Globally, we expect delivery to be a $4 billion business in 2019 for McDonald's and franchise restaurants. Across our major markets, we've maintained double-digit delivery sales growth in restaurants offering the service for more than 12 months.","In the UK and Spain, delivery now accounts for greater than 10% of sales in restaurants that offer delivery. In the U.S. McDelivery with Uber Eats is now available in more than 9,000 restaurants, which is more than half of all McDonald's U.S. restaurants.","They're also continuing to add new partners that allow us to scale and deploy delivery to meet untapped customer demand. We recently announced a partnership in the U.S. with DoorDash to expand the availability and accessibility for customers to receive our delicious food wherever they are. We will quickly scale with DoorDash across the U.S. to provide customers with a choice of delivery partners.","In Canada, we've seen incremental strength in delivery with our second national partner, SkipTheDishes. We offer delivery in 850 restaurants in Canada, many of which offer delivery from both partners. Multiple delivery partners now are also the norm in Italy, Spain and Russia, where we're learning from our partners whilst driving increased delivery orders.","We're also taking bold action on digital. Since closing the Dynamic Yield acquisition in April, we launched the decision logic technology on digital menu boards in drive-thrus across multiple regions in the U.S. Customers have responded to the point-of-sale suggestive selling by adding french fries, drinks, Chicken McNuggets and other favorites to their orders. We're already seeing an increase in average check by improving our ability to offer customers what they are likely to want with suggestions based on time of day, weather, and items already in customers\u2019 orders.","We introduced Dynamic Yield technology in Australia this month, and we'll increase the number of drive-thrus in the U.S., using the technology from about 700 today to over 8,000 in the next two weeks. By year-end, we plan to integrate the technology in nearly 100% of our drive-thrus in both markets. This is another example of using technology to create more engaging experiences for our guests.","The technology infrastructure we\u2019ve built over the past three years to support our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators is fundamental to our transformation. It's a reflection of what our customers demand from us, and it's not static. Digital capabilities change by the day and impact what customers ultimately expect from us. The technological ecosystem we're building will enable us to meet these rising expectations, positioning us for new opportunities to elevate and transform the customer experience.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for a look into the financial results for the quarter.","Kevin Ozan","Adjusted earnings per share of $2.05 grew 7% in constant currencies for the quarter when excluding impairment and other strategic charges from both the current and prior years. Our results have benefited from strong operating performance for the quarter. Revenue grew 3% in constant currencies as our comp sales growth more than offset the impact of refranchising activity.","Adjusted operating margin for the first half of the year was 43.2%, an increase of 30 basis points versus last year. As a result of our franchising efforts over the past few years, the largest component of operating income is our franchise margin dollars. With growth of 9% in constant currencies for the quarter, franchise margin dollars now represent nearly 85% of total restaurant margin dollars. Our consolidated franchise margin percent declined 100 basis points as our strong sales performance was impacted by higher EOTF related depreciation in the U.S., as well as 70 basis points from the lease accounting presentation change that I discussed last quarter. As a reminder, this presentation change has no effect on our franchise margin dollars, but the impact to our franchise margin percent will be ongoing.","Turning to our company-operated restaurants. Consolidated margins grew 20 basis points to 18.1% for the quarter. IOM segment company-operated margins were flat versus prior year, as our strong sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor and other costs, such as delivery commissions.","U.S. company-operated margins grew 40 basis points to 16.3%, reflecting strong sales performance and refranchising, partially offset by continued commodity and labor pressures, along with higher EOTF-related depreciation.","Second quarter pricing for both the U.S. and the big five markets in the IOM segment, was up about 2.5%, while commodity costs were up a similar amount across these markets. In the U.S., we expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat in the back half of the year and still expect our grocery basket to be up 2% to 3% for the full year. For the big five markets in the IOM segment, we expect a full year commodity cost increase to be up roughly 2.5%.","G&A was 2.1% of system-wide sales for the quarter and flat to prior year in constant currencies. We still expect G&A for the full year to remain relatively flat in constant currencies versus last year, as we continue to invest in digital and technology capabilities.","Our effective tax rate was 24.5% for the quarter, and we continue to expect a full year tax rate between 24% and 26%.","Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our second quarter results by $0.07 per share, given the strength of the U.S. dollar. At current exchange rates, we expect the foreign currency impact to lessen to $0.02 to $0.04 for Q3 with further easing into Q4. Our estimated full year headwind remains at $0.18 to $0.20. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.","Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","I've begun my remarks this morning by talking about momentum. The momentum we're building is apparent to our customers who seek the convenience and value of McDonald's great tasting food. It\u2019s apparent to our people; it\u2019s apparent to industry observers who are watching our transformation. ","Getting to these results wasn't easy. And we need to continue to work hard to sustain performance as we face macroeconomic and industry uncertainties around the world. While we remain confident in our strategies, customers are rewarding us for the investments we're making to offer them great tasting food, a modern and hospitable environment, and unparalleled convenience.","We all want to be associated with companies, organizations and brands that engage and inspire us, brands that are inclusive, fun, relevant and successful, brands that strive to improve communities and societies at large. That's where we're headed as we continue to unlock the potential of the Velocity Growth Plan and these accelerators. And it is why you'll see us continue to focus on our innovation and technology pipelines. This is our version of success.","We're building a better McDonald\u2019s for a culture of innovation focused on a better customer experience, a culture that strives to make the jobs of restaurant employees easier, and a culture that is focused on sustaining long-term growth. This is our mindset as we push ourselves to execute our Velocity Growth Plan and accelerators with the strong sense of urgency, passion, and commitment.","With that, we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mike Cieplak","Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thanks. Steven, can you give a little more context to the mix growth in U.S. that seems to be accelerating? Certainly outperformance outside the lower ticket breakfast occasion that's continued, as well as lapping $1 $2 $3 from last year helps. But, I think investors are wondering about the endurance, the customers\u2019 ability to continue to pay up, absent any growth in traffic. Relatively, the most tangible driver may be Dynamic Yield as we look forward. In the 700 stores that have added the initiative so far, have you experienced the consistent lift to sales, particularly on mix, once the drive-thru adds the initiative, or have the lifts of sales been more varied? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, Andrew. As you say, clearly, this is a check-driven sales comp growth in the U.S. What I think is encouraging for us and gives us confidence that we build more sustaining platforms. It's the balance of how that check is built. So, we're about two-thirds improved product mix and one-third improved price. So, I think that's a fairly healthy balance.","When you kind of drill into it, I mean, there's a number of elements that play in it, so helping with this. So, if we just look at some of the menu activity and promotional activity through the quarter for instance, there was a good local co-op initiative, which -- menu development co-ops initiative, particularly for the Easter period on the Filet-O-Fish promotion, which gave us an incremental lift. We've been pleased with the way the Worldwide Favorite promotion has worked, and that's beating or maybe this one exceeding our targets and is giving us incremental business.","As we continue to innovate around the kind of the heart of the group platform, the Quarter Pounder cheese with different options around lettuce and tomato, that also works along with -- we actually realized lift on the Happy Meal business, particularly now we've reestablished the relationship with Disney. So, I think, there's a number of elements through just the menu and marketing piece that have given us -- building on platforms that has taken us a while to invest in or operationally embrace, but is now beginning to deliver more consistent results.","Also we\u2019re seeing, as we convert the EOTF restaurants here, we're getting an incremental sales lift from that, some of which will come through growing and increasing use of the self order kiosks where we generate higher average checks as we mentioned before.","Alongside delivery -- don't forget delivery, remember, very much -- as that becomes a large part of our business, we\u2019re still seeing about twice the average check on the typical delivery order as well. So, there's a number of contributors. It's not a one single contribution, or if you look through right across the business, I think it\u2019s the culmination. A lot of the initiatives that we've been investing in the last two or three years are beginning to come together, which is giving us encouragement.","On Dynamic Yield, we've been really pleased. I'm going to say sort of three months in, couldn't be more pleased with the integration of Dynamic Yield, both as a company and as a culture, but also, frankly, getting the capabilities into our restaurants. So, we've been running 700 restaurants now for the best part of two and a half months. We're seeing consistent trends across different dayparts, across different days of week, across those 700. And that's certainly encouraged us with the support of our owner\/operators, of course, to quite significantly accelerate the rollout. We know the technology works, we can plug it into our existing outdoor digital menu boards. So, we're going to go from about 800 now to 8,000 by this time, in two weeks\u2019 time, which is fantastic. And we would expect to see -- we have no reason to believe that the kind of lifts we are beginning to see, and I'm not going to go into those details, but kind of lifts we're seeing at the moment, we expect to continue across obviously the accelerated rollout.","What\u2019s also been really encouraging to us on that front, it\u2019s subject to Dynamic Yield. We've taken it into our first international market and have gone very, very quickly from that 20 restaurants to 150 in Australia. The reason that's important is because -- and I don't want to get too much into it, but the content management system, the kind of the brain, which holds all the data, which Dynamic Yield product works after that produce work, we can show on the digital menu boards. Internationally, they have one typical content management system, and the U.S. has another. And we've been able to prove very, very quickly that the technology works on both platforms, which really indicates this is ready for a global expansion. So, we'll be careful that we don't get over our skis on it. But, the pulse of the market is strong. The excitement of the owner\/operators is great. And the most probably rewarding or one of the most rewarding elements, one of the business results is it just makes the managers and crew life easier in the restaurant as well. And order-taking process is a little quicker because we don't have to manually suggest to sell, the technology does it for you.","So, that is a long answer. But plenty of -- wide variety of initiatives, are helping support that. And not least by the way, just the fact that we\u2019re actually running the restaurants better. The focus we put on the drive-thrus, which I spoke about the last quarter, we\u2019re seeing drive-thru times dropping almost all of our major international markets, and notably here in the U.S. as well. So I'm going talk maybe more about that later.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. And Steve, I guess, while we're on the subject of speed of service, I just wanted to ask, I guess at the opening remarks, you talked about having a philosophy of not focusing on incremental change but focusing on more step changes in your overall strategy. So, I'm just wondering, if there's something on drive-thru speed that can accelerate the progress you're seeing? It seems like it's been fairly shallow so far, but perhaps I'm mistaken on that. And then maybe one clarification at the end, I just wanted to understand the traffic growth or traffic decline in the U.S. and Q2. Did that change from what you saw in Q1 or did it remain around the same level? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Well, let me take the drive-thru one. Once a year, we get our leaders from around the world together, so probably 60, 70 strong, including the managing directors of our top 20 markets. And we got together at the start of March. And whilst clearly it's been a really strong performance across the last 3 to 4 years, there are some areas where we know we need to do better. And we kind of had a white of the eyes conversation at the start of March. And we collectively agreed that we were going to renew some emphasis on the drive-thru service times. They've been going the wrong way with most of our markets for 3 or 4 years for reasons we can understand, as we\u2019ve added more to our business, but we knew that wasn\u2019t a sustaining trend. ","So, when you talk about progress in the drive-thru, I mean, frankly, it will improve. We want to get incremental improvement week-to-week-to-week. So, each time a customer comes back, say a week or two later, they can notice a few seconds difference. There's been a ton of things we've done. We've had some centrally led initiatives but also some market dynamic. All the stuff from many some of the menu simplification moves that you would have read about, particularly here in the U.S. where we streamline the late night menu, removing of the signature crafted, which was slowing down service times, and giving some of the local co-ops a chance to roll back some of the all day breakfast rollout from the second phase.","So, those things just helped smooth the operation in the kitchens. But, we\u2019re also introducing -- increasingly introducing technology, and diagnostic tools. Our managers and crew can see in real time in the drive-thru lanes. They can basically decompose the various elements of a drive-thru visit for a customer into its constituent seconds. So, how long are we taking to take the orders? How long are we taking to take the payment? How long it takes us to gather the food and present it? How many cars are we asking to pull forward and bring the food later? And just with that attention, we\u2019re beginning to see notable changes. So, it clearly takes off really by start of this quarter.","Just to give you a slight sense of what we're seeing already. In June, for example, in the U.S., we saw a 15-second reduction year-on-year in service times in the drive-thru, which I would say is more than incremental. I mean, that's notable. And clearly, that's rewarding for customers, it's a smoother journey. It also helps us with throughput as well. So, there's certainly a lot more to do. But, I'm really encouraged. And in certain other international markets surpassing double that type of production with the focus we\u2019re putting on. So there's more to come.","Kevin, you may want to talk a little bit to traffic decline?","Kevin Ozan","David, regarding guest counts in the U.S. in the second quarter. I think, there wasn\u2019t a meaningful change in the underlying guest count trend in the U.S.. The actual number for the second quarter was, I'll say, less negative than the first quarter. But, there were some specific things in the second quarter, some of which Steve mentioned earlier, things like the calendar shift with Eastern timing this year versus last year that a little bit benefited the second quarter; as Steve talked about, the Filet-O-Fish. We had about 70% of our co-ops that offered a Filet-O-Fish deal in Q2. That helped drive sales and guest count. And then Worldwide Favorites obviously was an LTO. That helped the second quarter too. So, while the actual number was less negative in the second quarter, I'd say there really hasn't been a meaningful change in the underlying trends.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Just following on that. One clarification, if you could just provide some color on the breakfast side of the business in the U.S. I got the impression last quarter that you were keen to see the breakfast had turned more favorable. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether there was any accelerating momentum in the quarter, where it stands, the percentage of sales and maybe how breakfast compares to the to the rest of the day?","And then, I just wanted to ask one other thing. Should we expect, Kevin, an update on the return of cash targets as we now finish out \u201819 and we're going to get another three-year bucket as we look out through the next few years or how should we think about the outlook for that going forward? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, Jeff. I'll take the first one. We did see a better trading performance in the breakfast daypart in quarter two, the combination of local activity with a local comp support, plus we did get to see some strong results out of the McCaf\u00e9 initiatives and the donut sticks that would be launched in the first quarter as well. So, on the daypart, we grew sales. It was still the slowest growing daypart amongst the day, but we're back to a solid sales growth. There\u2019s still guest count decline as I think we mentioned before, as there's been plenty of other entrants who are competing in the breakfast market, and we don't have it all our own way, the way perhaps we used to, back in the day. So, it remains competitive. We\u2019ve got sales growth. We're encouraged by that, but we know we\u2019ve got more work to do.","Kevin Ozan","And regarding returning of cash target. So, as you know, this year, we\u2019ll complete our three-years $25 billion target. We're on track to do that. So, we'll finish that this year. Later in the year, then, we'll provide an update as far as what that means going forward, perhaps beginning in 2020.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Can you just update us maybe on the U.S. franchisee relationships? In particular, I think you slowed down the EOTF rollout in concession to them. But now, you're talking about profits, for eight months rising? Is there a greater enthusiasm to embrace this maybe and pull forward some of the things you talked about in \u201821 and \u201822 and get it done faster? Can you also talk about maybe where they stand or where you stand on delivery? I think there was some friction around commissions and sort of the economics of that. Have you resolved some of those issues? And I think there were some adjustments you made -- plan to make in the back half, just what those adjustments to royalty or rent relief associated with that. Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks, John. As I\u2019ve said before, 2018 was a really hard work year. I mean, both the other operators, and the company invested a lot of time, a lot of effort, a lot of money in really kick starting the bigger, bolder vision, as the plan they built. And that does create tensions at a point in time, and that's natural. We worked our way through them. I would say that by easing off -- the speed of the EOTF -- those owner\/operators who wanted a bit of breathing room, were able to select that and push one or two projects out which gave them a lot more confidence and comfort. That said, the results we\u2019re getting from the EOTF rollout are really strong, and they are similar -- very similar to what we've seen elsewhere in the world. So, you\u2019ll find, the majority of owner\/operators are sticking with the original plan, the accelerated plan, really to complete their businesses by the end of 2020.","It will be optional for owner\/operators to pull their projects forward if they want to in 2021 and 2022. They're welcome to. We'll be ready for it. I think what it has also given us is -- I mean, we're a wonderful learning organization as a system. We're always driving curious to get better. And if we look at the performance of EOTF, as an example, because you mentioned it, the downtime of the projects, we're about 2 to 4 days better this year than we were in 2018, which clearly helps get the business back on track. The time to recover the sales as in when you reopen, getting yourselves back up to the levels, that recovery time is quicker. And also, the dip during the closure is a little less this year than it was last year. So, I think our execution around these 2,000 projects this year is sharper, but probably those 3 elements, which again builds confidence in the owner\/operators that this is going to be a stronger business outcome for them.","With delivery, yes, we\u2019re clearly keen to roll this out. The owner\/operators know this is a great business opportunity. We have, around the world, with our owner\/operators in each of our markets to find an arrangement with them as to how we can best take some of the heat out of the commission costs they face in order to make it encouraging. We want them to make money out of it and we, as a company, will make money as a result.","So, I think we're in a far better place. I think probably the two indicators just here in the U.S. that will demonstrate the confidence the owner\/operators have is that once we settled on this new rent arrangement with them, I think, it was within about a week, they voted on a national marketing campaign with Uber Eats to put marketing dollars behind delivery. And the eagerness with which they've embraced the second and third-party operator being DoorDash. I mentioned in my opening comments, we\u2019ve got around 200 restaurants in Houston on DoorDash at the moment. And that's just really making sure we integrate the technology and get the operation right. By the end of August, we\u2019re going to have probably two ways of around 4,000-plus restaurants. So, we\u2019ll be up at about 9,000 on DoorDash by the end of August, again, just showing you the speed we're going, and hence the owner\/operator commitment behind it. And we've got already about 9,000 with our kind of our key strategic partners as Uber Eats. There's no perfect crossover. There\u2019s going be about an additional 1,200 restaurants that have either one or other depending on coverage. That means, there is about 8,000, which we\u2019ll have two third-party operators. And yes, we've seen around the world that gives us good incremental delivery business.","Customers are typically, not solely, but typically are loyal to one third-party operator app. So, we know what we're seeing from Canada when we added SkipTheDishes to the Uber Eats platform. We\u2019ve also seen elsewhere around the world, such as in Italy where we\u2019ve got three, where we\u2019ve got Glovo, Deliveroo and Uber Eats. So, we\u2019ve got good experience of work in multiple delivery partners and we're confident the incrementally will come with it, and then, as a result, the cash flow to the operators. But ultimately, the mood of the operators, I think are feeling much more confident. By May of this year, their cash flow growth eclipsed the decline that they saw in 2018. So, as you can imagine, that gives people a great sense of satisfaction. June continued that. So, we now have 8 months in a row of cash flow growth. And they're confident and committed to maintaining that such trend forward, because they\u2019ve committed a lot to this plan, they committed a lot to our business and we want them to build business growth and success.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","Thanks for the question. Just maybe going back to the drive-thru times, can you quantify how much those were up? And then, I guess, the question is, how much have you recaptured with the 15-second, and what percentage of what you have seen in increased in the last few years? And then, how much opportunity do you think there is going forward? And what's the key strategy to address as that as there are changes you have to make on the product front or menu front to kind of capture more time savings? Thank you very much.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. I wouldn\u2019t get into all the details of drive-thru service. They do differ by country as well, obviously, depending on how busy the drive-thrus are. I mean, we've got certain markets in Europe where drive-thru is only about 40% of the business of a drive-thru restaurant whereas here in the U.S., it can be upwards of 70% to 75%. So, that creates a totally different service time dynamic. I would say, across the major markets. As we sat down in March, we wanted to set ourselves abundantly to be about 30 seconds better, which we knew would be notable, and not to be notable to the customer and also then business enhancing as this eases up throughput, particularly in those peak service times. Obviously, that's the most critical time to do it.","There's a number of different initiatives to it. I mean, some of it is just getting the focus, I mean, understandably with the aggressive rollout of Experience of the Future. There was a heightened focus in store, front counter dining area, we\u2019re just rebalancing that. So it's just the focus on the drive-thru, people positioning, making sure we\u2019re starting right training and the basics. But, there are certain things for example, on menu, and I think we've got a far more forensic ability through our global operations team and our innovation center now to analyze the complexity of our menus by market and identify those slower-moving items that really are not contributing much to incremental margin and certainly not selling in many volumes, but great barriers to service.","So, those diagnostic tools and forensic tools we have now is providing the information into each of the markets, they can make smart menu decisions. But it's not just about the menus around technology as well, and actually just making it fun. I mean, we've had a number of service competitions around all the markets. And particularly now we're getting these tools to the restaurants, to the managers. When I first saw this, the drive-thrus timer tools in Canada probably 12 to 18 months ago and then saw them rolled out in Europe probably about 12 months ago. There is a majority in the U.S. drive-thrus now. Probably what captured my attention among anything else was the enthusiasm the managers and the crew had to that kind of local competition, how are you doing most of the drive-thrus in your area, drive-thrus in your owner\/operator group, or the drive-thrus that have similar volume to you. So, we can use these tools in many ways to A, identify where the barriers are but actually just make it fun, incentivize and getting enthusiasm in management and crew. So, more to come. I'm encouraged with where we\u2019re at. We\u2019ve some markets which are actually 30, 40 seconds quicker now just three or four months in. So, they've got a bigger opportunity than some but they're making good headway. And the U.S., I'm proud of where the U.S. is at. I know they're focused on getting better than the 50. ","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS. ","Dennis Geiger","Thanks for the questions. I wanted just to ask a bit more about the U.S. guest counts. Maybe if you could just highlight a bit more where you're seeing progress and where the biggest opportunities are to continue to show that improvement? And then I guess within that context, Steve, I think you've talked in the past about a growth strategy to retain customers, regain customers and convert casual customers. Any update there you could give, specifically on the converting the casual customer, and if that's still how you're thinking about getting that discount up in the U.S.? Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Dennis, it's Kevin. I'll take a stab at that and Steve can chime in. As far as progress or opportunity, I think, as we've talked about, certainly one of our biggest opportunities continues to be at breakfast. As Steve talked about, there's been a lot of new entrants into that space. So, there's not many players that are growing, comp guest count at breakfast, or really in most of the dayparts. But new entrants have kind of caused a scattering, I'll say, of the existing guest counts among just more units.","As far as retain, regain convert, the convert strategy for us was always around kind of opportunities in either other dayparts or other areas that we didn't have our fair share, if you will. So areas like coffee and snacking and areas that are potential further growth opportunities, but we're not as strong in some of those areas. It wasn't necessarily taking some of our existing customers and just having them come more frequently. So, there still are opportunities in some of those areas, again, like coffee and like snacking.","I think, the way, we think about it is, there's an opportunity, and this is what kind of one of the purposes of both EOTF and our digital is to take our existing relationship with customers, and expand that relationship through digital means, whether that's through apps, further loyalty program at some point. But, the whole customer relationship where we can get to know and personalize offers easier and better for existing customers. That's one of our big opportunities.","The U.S. guest counts will continue to be a, we call it a street fight just because it's a very competitive environment here in the U.S. But, I think, there is more of a focus on what do we need to do in the various dayparts. Again, breakfast probably being the biggest opportunity for us to regain some of those guest counts that we lost. And it really is about, we call it losing guest count, but it's not losing customers, it's losing customer visits. So, it's customers that may not be visiting us as often as they were historically. And if we can regain some of those additional visits, especially a breakfast time, which is, as you know, a very habitual ritual. And so, if we can get those customers coming again at breakfast, it would be a huge benefit.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to support Kevin's comments, particularly around the, if you like, the technology ecosystem we're building here. For us to have a personalized relationship with our customers, which I think will be valuable to us and also make it valuable to them, we've got to find ways for them to identify themselves, when they enter the drive-through, without slowing the drive-through process down, identify themselves at the self order kiosk. And again, even though this is less pressure on time there, you don't want it to slow them down. Or for example, if they're having home delivery, and when we get some route delivery through the McDonald\u2019s app and we're working with our partner of Uber Eats, we're going to be getting the ability to route those orders through the McDonald\u2019s app. Once we can start a link, a drive-through transactions, to in-store transactions to home delivery, we started to build a really good picture of our customers and eventually person-by-person. I think that will be incredibly valuable for us to make ourselves more relevant and more interesting to those customers. And from customer perspective, just make the experience smoother and more enjoyable.","So, you'd expect to hear more, there are certainly some initiatives we\u2019ve been working on the markets right now on those. Nothing to say at scale yet, but I can assure you the culture of innovation that we've got going here is playing out. We've got a number of initiatives in number of our markets, we're learning very, very quickly how best to identify customers or customers to choose by themselves is a better way of saying it, at drive-thru and the in-store, we believe we've got the home delivery piece already initiated. I'm really excited about what they could offer to business.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Jon Tower with Wells Fargo.","Jon Tower","Great, thanks. I just wanted to talk quickly on the unit growth. I think today, you bumped up your expectations for 2019 to 800 stores net. And over the past two years, you've seen a nice jump in absolute net numbers. So, can you discuss whether or not you expect this type of net openings to persist in the future? What's fueling this growth or franchisees in new markets, seeing better returns than in the past? Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Yes. Thanks, John, for the question. Couple of things. First, related to the I'll call it change, slight change in guidance in the outlook section of the release. Really, what's driving that net additions number of about 50 higher than it was last quarter is less closings. So, our gross openings number for this year will be similar to what we thought it was going to be, but the closings that we originally anticipated, beginning the year a little bit lower. And about half of those are in our Developmental Licensed markets and about half of them are in the International Operated markets, half of the change in closing that is. ","As far as how we think about unit growth, there's still a lot of potential, even in our mature markets. So, markets like Canada, France, Italy, Spain, have a lot of opportunity to continue growing new units, and the U.S. even long-term we believe.","Now, what's helpful in the way we've changed our business model is what you actually see is right now substantially, the large portion of openings are in our Developmental Licensed markets, China and the other DL markets, which use their capital. So, it\u2019s a pretty efficient way for us to grow. So, you should expect to see continued growth in new units, again, both in the DL markets by our partners, as well as in our more mature markets that we own, like the ones I just spoke about.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to add on to that. I just want to give a shout out to some of the mid-size operated markets. Recently I've been in Italy, Poland, Netherlands, I mean, these markets are doing double-digit sales comps on top of double-digit sales comps. And hence, that\u2019s creating clearly significant increase in volumes and throughput of restaurants and putting some capacity pressure on. So, I\u2019d tell you, desire in the market is to sort of pick up the openings a little bit. I'm heading out to Russia in about two months time to spend some time there with the team. And again with a strong growth at both guest counts and sales they are seeing, I know they have an ambition for growth. And if you remember, we previously called that segment the high growth segment, and that was because we expected them to grow units at a greater pace than the perhaps the more mature market. So, we're keeping a real close eye on it. And the stronger we grow the business, then the stronger the confidence level is to grow the units as well. So, more to come by the end of the year.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Can you guys talk a little bit more about your store level margins in the United States? It's the first time, they've expanded in five quarters, and certainly were much healthier level than all of us analysts were forecasting. I know you said refranchising with the positive impact, Kevin, but I think probably a similar impact, as you've seen in recent quarters. So, are the franchisees seeing a similar margin trend change this quarter? And if so, what drove that? And then just following up on the EOTF. Can you tell us what the net impact you believe EOTF was on comps this quarter and how you expect that to change into the second half? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Let me start with the store level margins. And I guess, I'll talk about company operated margins, because obviously, we have -- those are our restaurants. So, I can see a lot of detail related to those. I think, one of the big differences is -- certainly comps in the second quarter were higher than they were, let's say in the first quarter. And obviously higher comps definitely help that. But the other thing I'd say is there's a little bit more stability in the restaurants in 2019 than 2018. Steve talked earlier about kind of the hard work and all the things that we threw at the restaurant in 2018, including EOTF, a lot of projects, fresh beef, the restructure we did in the field, all those changes that kind of impacted the restaurants. And so, kind of as we've now kind of I\u2019ll say stabilize the business a little bit, and just have less overall initiative deployment, as well as slowing the pace or getting near the end of kind of our refranchising, the restaurants are now able to just focus on running the restaurants as efficiently as possible. So, we saw kind of more efficiency in labor productivity in the second quarter than we've seen in the -- than we saw in the first quarter and last year.","On the franchisees side, we've talked about their cash flow is up. So, their unit level economics have been doing well, similarly. So, I think that's probably the biggest change as far as what we're seeing in margin versus last year, certainly.","Related to EOTF, I'd say the benefit in the second quarter was a little higher than it was in the first quarter, and we would expect that to be relatively similar for the remaining quarters of this year. As we said, we completed about a 1,000 projects this year, but as you -- so far this year of our 2,000 that will complete in total. But that's coming off of finishing about 4,500 last year. So, we have a big base of projects that are now complete that we're seeing the benefit of, in addition to kind of improvement in how we're doing those projects, as Steve talked about less downtime, quicker recovery, et cetera. So, we expect those EOTF benefits to continue. And obviously, as we have completed more projects, that certainly helps future results.","Mike Cieplak","As we near the top of the hour, we'll take one final question from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","I just have two quick follow-ups, if I may. The first was on the EOTF and traffic in the U.S. I had been in the impression that last year, part of the issue was during the store closures you lost some traffic. And I would have thought maybe you'd have gotten that back this year. But, it sounds sort of like, you haven't gotten the traffic back so much as the customers that are still going to McDonald\u2019s are just spending more and EOTF is supporting that. I just wanted to understand the dynamics there between like -- and lapping the closures? And then just on China, are you seeing any cannibalization? We've noticed across the board a lot of restaurants taking up unit growth in China and seeing their comp decelerate accordingly. Is that something that you have to contemplate, or are you still so underpenetrated, it's not really an issue there.","Kevin Ozan","I can start with EOTF. Related to EOTF. So, last year, as you mentioned, we had restaurants closed, the ones that needed to be -- primarily the ones that had the big projects what we call non-modernized, so the ones where we needed to do a remodel plus the EOTF components. This year, while there's less number of projects being done, there are a higher percentage of those non-mods being done. And so, while we've gotten better at reducing the amount of time that they're closed, we still have some of those closures. Now, that isn't the only issue obviously related to traffic though. Again, to be fair, we were losing traffic before we started the EOTF, and that won't fix all the issues related to traffic. So, the traffic piece is beyond just EOTF. And as we've gotten better and done more of these EOTF projects, we're getting better at completing those. But that in and of itself won't resolve all of the traffic issues.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to pick up on the China question, Sara. We had really strong system-wide sales growth in China for the quarter. Clearly, we've got a rapid pace of expansion of new restaurant openings, but we also grew sales and grew guest count in the quarter as well. So core business is robust. And I would say probably exceeding the opening plans that we've initially expected. I mean, if you look at the five-year period ending 2022, our partners are looking to exceed more than 2,000 openings that are certainly on track at the moment. And having called out recently, there are -- been very confident moving out of the same level of business. I mean, it's incredibly competitive. You've seen the pace at which other people are expanding. But it is a huge market. The emerging middle class, there's a greater affordability of the mass population there is heading towards Western QSR type of average checks and affordability. So, it's certainly a market we're excited about, we\u2019re very confident about the long-term future there, and really pleased with the way the partners are working out as well. They're doing terrific job. So, it'll be more than 400 openings this year after about 400 plus last year as well. And if they can keep the sales comps going at the same time, then, clearly, that indicates a healthy position for the business.","Mike Cieplak","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us. Have a good day.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations from McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you, Chris and good morning, everyone. We begin 2016 in a much better place than we were 12 months ago. Today, we are more aligned to the system, franchisee cash flows and our major markets are improving and we have a strong commitment to executing our turnaround plan.","Our near term priorities are clear. Our turnaround plan is the first step to fortifying the fundamentals of our business and restarting growth. It\u2019s grounded in running great restaurants, driving operating growth, creating brand excitement and enhancing financial value. These actions ultimately position us to strengthen and grow as a more competitive and more modern business. We\u2019ll build on this foundation as we position McDonald\u2019s for long term growth that would drive shareholder value in 2016 and beyond.","Different markets are in different stages of the turnaround. The U.S; our largest market is currently in the trajectory change phase. While we are pleased with the recent positive momentum in the U.S. it will take at least six more months of posted comparable sales and guest count growth to progress through the sustained and prolonged growth phases of our turnaround.","I am confident in the actions we are taking and attraction is beginning to take hold. Most importantly, customers are noticing a difference. Our customer feedback systems are showing improvements in many important aspects of the customer visit, including food quality, order accuracy, speed and friendliness.","In many ways 2015 was a year of two halves. The first half of the year our performance fell short of expectations as I stepped into my role, my priority was to objectively assess our business, diagnose our opportunities and develop a leaner organizational structure.","The second half of the year was about execution. The new operating structure that went into effect on July 1 sharpened our focus through a great accountability and removed distractions and bureaucracy to speed up decisions and increase our ability to move winning tactics quickly across markets.","As markets adjusted to how they think and operate we began to get traction, ending the year on an upwards trajectory. Comparable sales were up 5% for the full quarter, up 1.5% for the full year. Operating income was up 16% for the quarter and earnings per share increased 26% both in constant currencies. Various current employer items outside our normal operations impacted earnings comparisons. Kevin will share more details. Excluding these items, earnings per share would have been up 10% for the quarter in constant currencies.","Now let\u2019s turn to segment performance. The U.S. remains fundamental to our turnaround given a significant contribution to consolidated results. U.S. comparable sales increased 5.7% for the full quarter marking the best quarter in nearly four years. For the full year, comparable sales grew 50 basis points, an encouraging change in trends after two years of declines.","While we\u2019ve seen recent improvements in comparable guest counts they remain negative for the full year. We need to do even more to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we\u2019ve lost.","Strong partnership with franchisees as we execute our business building initiatives has resulted in growth in restaurant level cash flows for both the quarter and the year. This is just one more indication of the progress we are making.","Our formula for success in the U.S. consistent with many other markets, a focus on operational excellence coupled with relevant menu news, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.","The foundational steps we took to enhance menu quality simplify restaurant operations and offer even more convenience to customers led to a palpable shift in momentum in the third quarter. All Day Breakfast fills on this momentum in the fourth quarter exceeding internal expectations during the launch phase. It\u2019s driving incremental business. Many customers who otherwise would have gone elsewhere are coming to McDonald's to enjoy some of their favorite breakfast items like our Egg McMuffin and Hash Browns at lunch and throughout the rest of the day.","At the same time, existing customers are adding breakfast entrees to their regular orders, boosting sales and average check.","In addition to benefitting top and bottom line growth, all-day breakfast positions us to regain market share we\u2019ve given up in recent years. Infact, since the launch of all-day breakfast we\u2019ve experienced positive weekly comparable sales gaps relative to our QSR sandwich competitors and we ended the quarter with a positive gap for 2.9%.","Another priority in the U.S. is the establishment of a consistent national value offering. We began testing McPick 2 earlier this month. This value offer gives customers the flexibility to bundle their choice of two items at a compelling price points.","Whilst it\u2019s still early, the offer appears to be resonating with customers. We\u2019ll continue to list them, and apply what we are learning as we move towards a more permanent national platform later this year to compliment the ongoing regional efforts.","I\u2019d also be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that the U.S. and several other large markets also benefitted from mild weather in the quarter.","Let\u2019s now turn to the international lead segment, which continues to operate from a position of strength. Full quarter comparable sales increased 4.2% and comparable sales were up 3.4% for the year. Strong full quarter comparable sales marked the U.K.\u2019s 39th consecutive quarter of growth as the market outperformed both the competition and the wider retail sector.","Performance was driven by a number of customer oriented office. Successful promotions featuring premium products like the new Big Flavour Wraps and the Chicken Legends drove growth and average check. The strong focus on our core menu items continued to elevate customer perceptions around quality and steady progress towards our experience of the future continues.","About a quarter of the U.K\u2019s restaurants are being converted, and plans are in place to do more throughout 2016. These restaurants offer modern in-store service platforms, such as self-order kiosks, digital merchandising and customized order pick up ways. We recently tested table service, and based on customers\u2019 favorable reaction; we plan to roll out across nearly all converted restaurants in 2016.","Australia also delivered a strong quarter of comparable sales despite lapping its best quarter in 2014. The market-wide deployment of experience of the future is driving incremental business. Customers were enjoying conveniences such as self-order kiosks and table service and taking advantage of the opportunity to customize their entrees to satisfy individual tastes.","Australia continues to fuel future growth by capitalizing on wins in other markets. Most recently it\u2019s taken a chapter out of the U.S. playbook testing all-day breakfast in 300 restaurants; it plans to go national later this quarter.","Australia\u2019s ability to quickly scale the successful initiative from the U.S. highlights one of the many ways our new segment operating structure is creating a more nimble McDonald's. In Canada, balanced growth across all-day parts drove another quarter with strong comparable sales. Engaging marketing campaigns including monopoly, festive food events, and the successful free copy promotion resonated strongly with customers.","At the same time, the market continues to make progress towards its version of experiencing the future. More than 175 restaurants are being converted with a significant number of additional conversions flattened in 2016.","In Germany and France, full quarter comparable sales were relatively flat. Germany\u2019s successful monopoly promotion featuring premium products along with our focus on add-on items help drive average check in a highly competitive environment. Value remains a critical priority in Germany.","In the coming weeks, we launch an integrated value strategy across our menu to strengthen our appeal to value conscious consumers. In France, the macro environment remains challenging.","The informally eating out market recorded its fifth consecutive year of decline. On top of the lagging economy and dampened consumer purchasing power, the November terrorist attack negatively impacted the entire eating out industry. We have seen this in Paris and in other cities throughout Europe.","Despite these headwinds, our brand remains strong in France. Successful monopoly promotions, along with the introduction of new premium products are increasing average check.","At the same time we are giving customers more options across lower tiers of our menu. The new items added to our Petit Plaisir line and the extension of McFirst into other proteins including fish.","We are working to become even more accessible to customers as we continue to open new restaurants including five new airport sites that were part of a deal we recently closed with Aeroport de Paris.","Turning to the high growth segment, full quarter comparable sales increased 3% and the comparable sales grew up 1.8% for the year. China\u2019s full quarter comparable sales increased 4%. Successful execution of key initiatives around value, convenience and breakfast are driving market share increases in a flat IEO environment.","Despite recent external challenges, we remain confident in the potential of this important market, and in the strategies we have in place to expand the brand even further. Infact, we plan to open more than 250 restaurants in China in 2016, the highest of any of our markets.","In Russia, strong comparable sales in the fourth quarter reflected ongoing recovery of brand trust. However, results may volatile moving forward giving continuing macro economic uncertainties and decreased consumer purchasing power.","One additional market I\u2019d like to highlight is Japan, where comparable sales increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter. Results were partly driven by comparisons to last year\u2019s supplier issue, even so this marked Japan\u2019s best quarterly performance in nearly four years. Same is diligently executing its revitalizing plan as they work to strengthen the brands appeal to customers.","Our consolidated performance reflects the meaningful progress we have made to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. Although some of our larger markets face challenging headwinds as we enter 2016, we expect continued positive topline momentum across all segments. We are focused on what we can control and committed to elevating every aspect what the customer experience. This is about running great restaurants and our entire system is rallying around this essential imperative every day.","The steps we\u2019ve taken have driven notable improvements in many larger markets but there\u2019s more work to done. 2016 will be about continuing to execute our turnaround plans, we\u2019ll concentrate on fortifying the fundamentals of our business as we deliver what people want and expect from McDonald's today while establishing the foundation for future growth.","Thanks everyone. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Steve and hello, everyone. As Steve mentioned the strategic actions we took in 2015 were critical to restoring momentum in our business and charting our path forward. Fourth quarter played a key role in both areas.","Today, I\u2019d like to discuss the drivers of our fourth quarter results, review our outlook for 2016, and provide an update on the progress we\u2019ve made on financial decisions announced in November.","Let\u2019s start with the look at fourth quarter results. As Steve indicated, we delivered solid comparable sales and operating income growth for the quarter. The increase in fourth quarter operating income reflects the benefit of positive comparable sales across all segments, a testament to the early impact of our turnaround efforts.","Fourth quarter results also reflected various current and prior year items outside of our normal operations. Relative to the prior year, these items included comparison against results which were negatively impacted by the China supplier issue and an increase in our tax reserves.","In the current year, these items included a gain of $135 million from the sale of a U.S. restaurant property and asset impairment charges of about $70 million in conjunction with our global refranchising efforts. Excluding the impact of these current and prior year items, fourth quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.13 or 10% in constant currencies.","Topline performance continues to have the biggest impact on our margins, and its one of the best indicators of the strength of our underlying business. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 50 basis points to 82%, driven primarily by the solid comparable sales in the U.S. and international lead markets.","Global company operated margin dollars increased 8% in constant currencies just $612 million for the quarter. While the company operated margin percent increased to 80 basis points to 15.2%. Comparison against challenging prior year results in the high growth and foundational segments accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter.","Partly offsetting these margin gains were higher incremental labor costs in the U.S. reflecting the ongoing impact from our decision earlier in the year to increase crew wages and benefits. These costs along with minimum wage increase have mandated by several states during the year, negatively impacted fourth quarter U.S. margins by about 350 basis points consistent with our expectations.","Solid comparable sales growth and favorable commodity cost helped minimize the impact of this labor pressure. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs decreased about 1% primarily due to lower beef cost. Looking ahead, U.S. Company operated margins for the first half of 2016 will continue to be impacted by labor pressures of a similar magnitude in both first and second quarters.","To offset some of this inflationary pressure, our U.S. fourth quarter pricing year-over-year was up over 2% placing our full year pricing below food away from home inflation of around 2.5%. 2016 food away from home inflation is projected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%.","Commodity costs for the international lead markets segment were up about 1% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 3%.","Looking ahead to full year 2016, commodity costs for the international lead segment are expected to be relatively flat, while U.S. commodities are expected to decline 1% to 2%.","G&A for the fourth quarter totaled $675 million, up 7% in constant currencies due to higher incentive-based compensation versus the prior year. Excluding incentive based compensation, G&A for the quarter decreased to as expected.","For the full year of 2016, G&A is expected to decrease about 1% to 2% in constant currencies. We expect G&A increases in the second and third quarters due to our worldwide convention in April and the summer Olympics in August.","Foreign currencies negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.11 and the full year by $0.50. At current exchange rates, there will be less pressure in 2016 with an expected negative impact on first quarter of $0.04 to $0.06 and full year of $0.18 to $0.20. As always, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.","Now I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2015 and our financial decisions announced in November around G&A, refranchising and our capital structure. Starting with our G&A spend.","In November, we disclose our net annual G&A savings target of $500 million from our G&A base of $2.6 billion at the beginning of 2015. This target excludes the impact of foreign currency changes. We expect to realize $150 million in savings by the end of 2016 with about half of these savings already achieved in 2015. We anticipate completing the vast majority of the remaining $350 million in savings by the end of 2017.","Developing our ownership strategy is also a fundamental component of our turnaround efforts and the catalyst for our decision to refranchise about 4000 restaurants by the end of 2018. While our refranchising targets implies approximately 1000 restaurants per year, we expect variability around this average within a given year as we work to balance the necessary time needed to select the best franchisees with our desire to execute our refranchising plans in an expedient manner.","During 2015 we refranchised about 470 restaurants and we are currently making progress towards completing the sale of two international markets to developmental licensees that will include the refranchising of over 400 restaurants.","As part of our evaluation of ownership strategies around the world, we have been reviewing our ownership levels in all markets. In conjunction with this effort, we are exploring the sale of a portion of our ownership in McDonald's Japan if we identify a strategic investor who could help advance Japan\u2019s turnaround efforts and unlock our growth potential with a view of enhancing value for all stakeholders.","We are in the early stages of the process and taking a thoughtful approach. We have an experienced and talented management team and a strong group of franchisees, all of whom are committed to enhancing our brand and supporting our turnaround in Japan with the Japanese consumer in mind.","Right now, we\u2019re focus on exploring the viability of finding the appropriate strategic investor. We are confident that whatever may transpire with our ownership McDonald\u2019s Corporation and McDonald\u2019s Japan will continue to have a franchise or franchisee relationship intended to promote McDonald\u2019s brand and business in Japan.","We remain confident in the McDonald\u2019s Japan business for the long term and their commitment to revitalizing the brand in Japan. In connection with executing against our refranchising and G&A targets. During 2016 we may incur incremental strategic charges associated with asset dispositions and restructuring.","In November we also committed to optimizing our capital structure. One month later we added $6 billion of debt to our balance with an average tenure of over 15 years and an average coupon of 3.8%.","We will likely have further debt additions during 2016 as we expect to return a total of about $30 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2016. For the three years ended 2015 we return $15.8 billion to shareholders leaving about $14 billion in combined dividends and share repurchase to be completed in 2016.","Collectively our refranchising efforts, G&A management and capital structure optimization will contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders.","In addition to moving forward on the financial decisions, we\u2019re maintaining our balanced and measured approach of investing in our business to drive future growth. For 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $2 billion split fairly evenly between opening about a 1,000 new restaurants and reinvesting in existing restaurants.","The majority of our new store capital is earmarked for the international lead and high growth markets, while roughly half of our investment capital will be devoted to U.S. restaurants.","As we begin the New Year, we\u2019re encouraged by recent results. However our financial performance in the coming year is not likely to be linear. As we move through 2016 we expect some variability in our quarterly results due to uneven prior year comparisons and some headwinds that exist, including macroeconomic issues in some of our high growth market and challenging quest counts in the U.S., Germany and France. Generating sustained positive guest traffic in these markets and around the world remains the top priority for 2016.","We also anticipate limited pricing power in several of our markets, as a relatively benign commodity outlook and low inflation could impact our ability to increase menu board prices.","In closing, we begin 2016 in a stronger position. Positive top and bottom line momentum across all segments and greater alignment with franchisees around our near-term path forward. We are committed to executing our turnaround plan, which starts with the diligent execution of operating great restaurants on a daily basis.","At the same time, we remained confident in our ability to execute against our financial decisions and evolve to a leaner, more heavily franchise business that generates long term value for our shareholders.","Thanks. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris, to begin our Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session ","A - Chris Stent","Thanks, Kevin. We will now the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To get as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We\u2019ll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Andrew Charles at Cowen & Company.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thanks. Mike, or if you're on the line, Steve as well, could you talk about the decision to run the January and February value platform at $2, as it seemed most quick-service sandwich operators are running promos in the $4 to $6 range prior to the introduction? As well as the margin profile of what McPick 2 look to looks like as well?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. There is no Mike here at the moment, so Steve here. So, I\u2019ll try on for this one for you, Andrew. Yes. So, we launched on 4th of January, we know that around 25% of our customers are value conscious, and that\u2019s value at a number of price points, but certainly at the entry level. And we like the construct of McPick 2. It\u2019s very early days. There is no like regular trading, information that we can particular share right now, but we know that the choice and the flexibility that we offer with two items at that compelling price point is attractive.","As you say others have chosen a different price point to go in and bundled more items into it. We think the choosing two out of four items we have in that menu gives that, that right balance between its simple, its easy for the customer that gives them the choice and flexibility and through the quarter of handful weeks we\u2019re certainly read the consumer response to it, we analyze the business results of it and can continue to work on developing the right value platform for us on an ongoing basis. ","The lead item on it is the double cheeseburger. That sold well but also the mozzarella sticks are going down really, really well and it\u2019s a great add-on item. So it\u2019s an incremental profit driver if you like both within the McPick 2 but also it\u2019s not an ultimately same.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thank you very much. You think about the outperformance that you saw against the industry in the fourth quarter of almost 300 basis points. Do you see this trend is a path in the fourth quarter maybe driven by the euphoria of all expected to settle in it a more moderate outperformance trend? Or do you think -- see this as something in collaboration with all your initiatives that something that\u2019s somewhat sustainable against you peers?","Steve Easterbrook","Well, certainly the idea of outperforming is something we want to maintain. We entered the quarter with good momentum in our business, clearly that was accelerated through the fourth quarter. And as we\u2019ve said, all-day breakfast was a primarily driver of that, but not the sole driver, so it exceeded our launch expectations, the period of time for it had exceeded our launch expectation, it was also little longer that we had projected, but we do expected to settle down. But and that\u2019s why we\u2019re working on a number of other initiatives in the business to follow that up, so this is not \u2013 we don\u2019t want this to be a single initiative turnaround plan, so the continued investment in food quality that could be the development of this value platform. And as we continue to reinvest in the fabric of our restaurant, we\u2019re confident the in-store experience will continue to improve. ","The operation improvements we\u2019re seeing to the drive-through old records in particular, we see its paying dividends, early days after launching a number of initiatives around people that beginning to see our start turnover decrease quite notable as well which we believe helps us deliver a better days experience. So, there\u2019s a number of dimensions to it, all-day breakfast is understandable a more of the headline grab up, it will settle down a little from its launch space, but we believe the building is other platforms of growth on top of that will keep us competitive in the marketplace in taking share.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short","Hi. Just following on that question, I was just curious in terms of the layers of momentum, you didn\u2019t even really given an update on the app. And then I also wondering if you could give a little update on the U.S. like guest experience in the future I think you were at 130 units in November? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, Karen. Its still early days for us, but I mean for us its \u2013 what we can offer in the future is exciting. What we\u2019re actually delivering now is really just a start, so we only really launch the app here in the U.S. at the end of the third quarter last year. But within three months we had over 7 million downloads which I think just start signal, the magnitude that we can build to as we develop office and functionality way beyond the basic. At the moment its largely offer base we\u2019re seeing those downloads being activated by customers and redeeming the offers in the restaurants. So, we believe its driving behavior. We\u2019re able to follow consumer behavior easy so we can read the data from it. But certainly as we build the capability of the app we think it\u2019s going to increase the compelling and the growth engine.","I would say that. For the first time, here at McDonald\u2019s we have build in a trading increase, a sale, an incremental sale expectations based on our digital platform. So little modest in 2016, but we\u2019re actually contributing to the business growth and being a platform this is going to deliver for many years to come as we can kind of understand our consumer behavior and be more rewarding to them.","With regards to the second piece, experience the future. We have around five markets up and running, as you say, with about a 130 restaurants. We\u2019re certainly looking to expand not necessarily those markets, but into new markets at a larger scale. And the U.S. will again pick some lead regions. So this is where the regional strength of the U.S. really comes to the fall. We got 23 regions here in the U.S. we\u2019ll be picking two or three of those to really look to accelerate that version here in the U.S. they experience the future through 2016 and into 2017. But there would be adopting a slightly different approach in those three regions, so it can actually learn in the market here what truly resonates the customers, what the business results are and the future potential.","So, and also given on this structure now we\u2019re learning so rapidly from the way that Australian has build their business kind of the building there as U.K. France and particular theirs, but we are rich in inside which is helping each other makes smarter decisions and shorten the time line, so we\u2019re certainly share more in a moment, the moment the majority of our growth we\u2019re building into the U.S. performance through 2016 is through continuing to deliver against the basics of our turnaround plan.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning. My question is on the U.S. comps momentum you saw in the fourth quarter which was very impressive, I was wondering Steve, if you help to sort of dissect what some of the drivers were in particular if you could help to quantify what you think to live from all-day breakfast might have been during the quarter and also the weather impact and then that\u2019s question number and then as a follow-up perhaps if you could talk about some of the structural improvements you\u2019re seeing what driver-through simplification if you\u2019re starting to see some progress and to be a service there? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Thanks, David. We don\u2019t want to give specifics on the respect drivers. But the pace that I want to make sure we don\u2019t lose it, but we were building momentum heading into the quarter and heading into the launch of all-day breakfast and I won\u2019t necessarily do a full laundry list of the work that team have done, but certainly around the fundamentals delivering a better high quality food experience day and day out. And you know, you heard me talk about the Devils is in the detail always around toasting of the buns and searing of the beef, and when you ally that with investing in the types of quality investment that customers care about structures; one of the antibiotics move we made in the poultry supply chain or the announcement that we on our journey is going to cage-free eggs. That just creates a buzz and customers know that you care about the same things that they care about and they just respond with their business. All-day breakfast was clearly the primary driver of the quarter. We knew it would be -- we focus the restaurants both operationally, marketing and merchandizing on that.","As I say through the launch base, we help contribute materially for the quarter, absolutely no doubt. We hit peaks. We exceeded the self contribution that we had projected and as I say it lasted longer through than a typical launch period does. But inevitably a settle down as we introduce other initiatives in the restaurants through 2016. the weather was no simple but not material, but I just though it was approximately and transparent to reference it because it did give us a positive contribution not just in the U.S. but in many of our major markets around the world that did provide a helpful tailwinds but I thought it would fair to recognize and just acknowledge.","In terms of the drive-though in particular, certainly the streamlines menu boards have made life easier for our customers and made life easier for managers and crew in the restaurants .So that experience has simplified and help speed things up. Alongside, the greatest barrier to the overall service experience in the drive-through we\u2019ve identified this order accuracy, so the team the operational teams have been working really on initiative \u2013 again, I won\u2019t go into the details we could ask \u2013 it just the way that we, the order experience to the customer where we can just confirm twice over that we capture the order right and then we\u2019re presenting exactly the right order to the customers before they drive off.","And we\u2019re finding that as noticeably improved well accuracy which in turns improve speed and clearly customer satisfaction, so we got plenty more to do. We\u2019re working through and continue to challenge the menu and if there is further simplification areas there, but simplification goes way beyond that. There\u2019s has been through packaging, through merchandizing through marketing where we can help the restaurants teams by taking work load of them, taking focus on the fundamentals of what they want for serving customers.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. In the last turnaround, but one of the early 2000s, clearly there\u2019s a focus or refocus on service execution you\u2019re just touching on some of that, so if you have any numbers on customer satisfaction today or in future quarters I think that will be really helpful to for people to get their head around the sustainability of return that maybe starting with all-day breakfast trial and bringing back those lapsed users.","On the premium platform innovation front, you feel like you\u2019re using this window perhaps being created by all-day breakfast to give yourself a pace of testing that is greater and in fact that you\u2019re building that pipeline for 2017 and beyond and if so, how is that looking and what giving your confidence there? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, David. So, in terms of customer satisfaction obviously we got a number of different ways that we can monitor customer\u2019s satisfaction, and we have one or two different systems around the world. There is not pay consistent measure as we speak. But we move and transition to a new customer satisfaction measure here which we call the Voice, which is actually we\u2019re gather multiple number of a customer feedbacks compared to where we were previously, so I didn\u2019t explain that very well. We\u2019re gathering a lot more consumer feedback than we ever have done, is the better way of saying is, certainly we\u2019re seeing overall satisfaction improving both in drive through and install and we\u2019re certainly seeing order accuracy in the drive through. ","We\u2019re around \u2013 the actually satisfaction on speed in improving, our speed time haven\u2019t improved as much as satisfaction has done, so we want to work operationally to physically speed up as service experience, but the same time customers are reporting a greater satisfaction with the speed, which is very encouraging. So that means the overall experience is working for them. In terms of the premiums, yes, absolutely, as you gather momentum and you start to get these growth drivers that you can layer upon each other, it means you can raised ahead and look a little further in the way you plan and develop the business.","So, on the premium side and by the way each market doesn\u2019t have to work in isolation. So we have a number of initiatives around the whether its Create Your Taste in Australia, a new premium range of signature burgers in the U.K. a similar version of that within France for example, and we have these sophisticated, well executed rollout across those market all of which is helping is inform us that where we had with the experience in the further. What we do now is customization is important. We don\u2019t know quite how much customization customers truly wish, it like a little bit of flexibility, but I don\u2019t need to have complicated, so we\u2019re working on that for example, ","We\u2019re working on the manner in which customers can order those premium burgers, a way from the traditional just through the drive-through or at the front counter and that\u2019s where I self order kiosks and potentially you can say where service comes into play. But again, we\u2019re getting a really good read on progress in some of other mature and lead markets and that certainly helping shape and inform the thinking here in the U.S. So, more to come, are we using the time to work on developing that platform? Absolutely yes, we are.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Greg Badishkanian at Citibank.","Q - Greg Badishkanian","Great. Thanks. Just trying to understand where you\u2019re getting your new customers from which is lifting same-store sales. You had two big introductions, the two for $2 all-day breakfast and do you think you\u2019re gaining \u2013 are you gaining those from burgers operators or while QSR to bought a restaurant category and just define each one, so I think you might be getting customers for each of those two programs?","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, Greg. I think we\u2019ve been pretty clear, but we go through the revitalize stage of this turnaround, the market share that we\u2019re looking to recover and grow is in our more immediate competitive grow. So that kind of QSR segment. And then as we strength and then ultimately want to get back to leadership position that we\u2019re aspire to, I think that growth will come from broader eye, So, at the moment the initial momentum we\u2019re seeing typically around the world is coming from QSR, some of that is recovering share as we lost as well.","So, that\u2019s certainly hardening for us. I would say, potentially one slide difference from that is around all-day breakfast which where we\u2019re capturing customers with really what is a different occasion there. So -- and that is new to us and McDonald\u2019s. I think the customers where the incremental business, an incremental visits were getting off probably from broader IEO segment, but typically our focus on this initial stage turnaround is around winner nearing market and recovering what we\u2019ve lost to getting into a period of outperformance.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. Just related -- somewhat related maybe actually unrelated, but one is on the pricing, you talked about being cautious on pricing overall all over in the U.S. I think you said the food away from home inflation was going to run some two plus percent, are you saying that you feel good about pricing in the U.S. given that inflationary level and if they maybe elsewhere and maybe talk about how you think about U.S. pricing specifically.","And just to clarify the SG&A, if you take it down 1% to 2% from 2015 levels its not going to match the 150 million your savings more like 50 billion, so is that because you\u2019re not including the operator conference in the Olympics on that calculation that sort of one off or not factored into that 500 million or how do we think about that?","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, John. Let me start with the pricing, because we think about pricing relatively similarly around the world and that is we look at a whole bunch of factors to influence our pricing that include food inflation, GDP growth, our internal cost inflation et cetera. Similar to how the U.S. will do it. So, for 2015 we said that the U.S. increase their prices a little over 2% compared to food away from home inflation of around 2.5% and that for 2016 food away from home inflation was expected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, so we would continue to think about pricing in a similar way as we\u2019ve been and keep an eye on that food away from home inflation, as well as food at home inflation just to make sure that we\u2019re not getting out of whack with that.","Related to the G&A, the way we look at it is, we saved \u2013 I\u2019ll say a little more then half of that $150 million in 2015, which means that we go into 2016 with our base or run rate of those savings built in. We\u2019ll look at 2016 similarly, so while we may not get all of those actual savings realized in 2016 will have it out of our base by the end of 2016, so that as we go into 2017 we\u2019re going in with the base, that\u2019s $150 million less than where we started at the 2.6 billion and that\u2019s a net number, so that includes the Olympics conventional or the additional cost in there also.","Chris Stent","Net question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thanks. Good morning. Going back to mobile you said 7 million downloads I believe, is that since you launched and how many have redeemed offers and what can you tell us about the profile. And then just a final thought on mobile, I believe if I understood correctly you early said, it\u2019s modestly in the guidance and what is giving you that convection to make that comment. Is this is new customer? Is it a loyal customer that spending more, just want are they doing? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Can you just repeat just that second part of the question, Nicole, about something in the balance?","Chris Stent","Why convictions were including.","Steve Easterbrook","Okay. Okay. Someone\u2019s explained here. Right, it\u2019s a two point of that question. So, there are number of metrics that we will follow through and we follow closely on a weekly basis, daily and weekly basis on the app. One is clearly the downloads. Then you want the registration numbers and then you want to see the activity. So we have 7 million downloads which gives people access to things like restaurant Russian locator, nutritional information and the rest. As I start to share their information get confident with us and clearly then they will start to register and we can then communicate if they no choice of their local restaurant or their preferred restaurant, then we can start to localize the offers to them and then we start to see the behavior.","We are seeing higher registration rates than industry norms from those downloads and we\u2019re also then tracking effectively frequency of usage and we\u2019re trying to encourage that with things like loyalty play such as buy any five McCafes of any size and you one free. So it and you get one free. So it\u2019s a fairly basic loyalty play just to get people familiar with using it and actively using and keeping it on their phones basically. ","The reason we have build a sale build into 2016 is because we have seen the incremental business, We\u2019ve have seen the incremental average check of redemptions, so when people redeem an offer we\u2019re actually seeing higher average check than we had expected to see, so we can see there\u2019s an incremental business driver, plus we got other initiatives that we both scale the number of customer and usage, but also enhance the overall experience as well which will encourage people to return to that more often and clearly hopefully return to McDonald\u2019s more often. ","So we have it really -- we have it week-by-week and month-by-month as a build and we about to clearly update ourselves on whether we hitting those projections, but its \u2013 it will be a helpful contributed to sales in 2016 and will help guide us around the world beyond to actually derive that return on the investments we\u2019re making in this digital strategy as a home.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley","Thank you. Like to ask two related questions on plans, First, with respect to the U.S. turnaround and sustainability of the U.S. turnaround, can you talk about some of the pipeline of ideas or you mentioned a platforms a couple of time, if you could be able to be more specific about how you\u2019re think about product news and innovation to sustained the U.S. comp and then a little bit longer term you\u2019ve referenced in the past that you would be sharing a longer term strategy at the worldwide on a operating conference in April and probably sharing that with the street sometime thereafter, I guess I was curious if that was still the game plan and if you can put any outline or any meet around what we might here?","Steve Easterbrook","Okay, Joe, so confidence as we build through 2016 in the U.S. I mean clearly we\u2019re planning for growth and we have a very robust plan that team has build, so that gives us confidence. We will continue to work the breakfast platform and beverage platform hard. Anyways its important day part for us and the all-day breakfast is the further growth opportunity which we\u2019re going to continue to work hard through 2016, getting the value platform right will be important to us as well we are taking a very serious look at it and learning from it before we than go into a national and permanent launch base but we feel good about where we\u2019re at in the moments.","You can expect to see as also focus more on our call menu. You know we are proud of the menu and we believe there is \u2013 these are iconic and real popular assets that we believe that we could \u2013 we can probably do a better job with it. We can bring to life and we\u2019ll continue to invest in the ingredients and the food quality and create some fun around that. You can expect to see. For to create fun around the brand you will also expect to return to one or two be promotional mechanics we have. We got opportunities throughout the year to just bring it some variety and some fun around promotional activity, shorter term promotional activity just to help provide that balance for the menu.","So I think -- and then with the digital platform layering on top of that, we believe we\u2019re building these building a platform that will continue to grow through 2016, but will also take this into 2017 and beyond. As we develop and better articulate here in the U.S. our Experience the Future that is something we know the system is excited about, we know its creating a lot of energy momentum elsewhere on the world and getting that right, and the business model right and actually getting the right elements of that for the customer here in the U.S. is going to important to us and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re going learn in 2016 [ph] because we believe that\u2019s going to contribute to 2017 and beyond. ","It sounds the longer terms strategy, I guess what we will want to see is we\u2019ve had two quarters of growth in this turnaround, so we would certainly be looking to see another quarter or two before we ourselves start to moving the turnaround plan into a longer term growth plan. What I can\u2019t tell you is that we have a small and senior team looking at developing what that growth plan looks like, the elements of it, the brand positioning of it and the vision behind it, but it\u2019s a small chain that\u2019s working discretely on it because at the moment the entire organization globally is focused on a turnaround. So, whether it\u2019s later in the second quarter or sometime in the third quarter, I would say by around the middle of the year when we get confident that it\u2019s the right time to transition from turn around it\u2019s a growth who share that internally and soon after externally.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Looking at the remodel CapEx going into U.S. stores, can you give us a sense of where the majority of those dollars are going? Is it more going to sort of cleaning up longer tailed stores that maybe haven\u2019t been reinvested in recently or more specific initiatives around kiosks or digital menu boards or something like that?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, Karen. For 2016, we said that about half of the reinvestment around the world will be reinvested in the U.S. That consists of several buckets if you will. It\u2019s probably four to five hundred reimages in 2016, about 90 rebuilds where we kind of tear down the restaurant and put up a new one.","It also would include capacity enhancements, things like putting in side by side drive through as well as our normal maintenance CapEx. It also would include digital menu boards in substantially all the restaurants in the U.S. So it consists of several of those components that would kind of comprise the total reinvestment in the U.S.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","Great, thank you. As the U.S. same-store sales recovery continues to build momentum, how should we be thinking about the pace of a potential restaurant level margin recovery, just a little color on that?","You guys have obviously given us some color on not only cost of goods sold for 2016, some of the incremental labor pressure that you introduced maybe by through last year, but is there anything preventing you from returning to the high teens of the U.S. restaurant level margins over the next couple of years again big caveat, I understand but assuming you guys can continue to deliver some topline momentum, can we see these high teens restaurant level margins again in the U.S.?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks Jeff. You know as you know when we talk about pretty often margins for us are topline gain. I mentioned that we\u2019ll have some pressure first and second quarter in 2016 as we kind of round out the additional labor cost that we have from the decision we made to increase wages for our restaurant crew. But with benign commodity cost, relatively reasonable inflation and hopefully from pricing capability, it will come down to what kind of comps we are able to achieve to determine whether we can grow margins.","I think what fourth quarter should have shown everyone is even with those labor pressures when we have good comps, you know again depending on where commodities are we are able to offset a lot of those pressures. So it really does come down to continuing to grow comps.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. Just a follow-on, on that question. Just wondering how you actually think about the interplay of commodity and labor especially as you look at the offerings going forward. I mean right now obviously with the commodity down, labor up, but just wondering is pricing easier this way or would you prefer do it the reverse?","I think, I think you mentioned from a food stand point where the food away from home is still 2.5% to 3.5% and you are going to be less than that. But food at home seems like its well below that entirely. So I\u2019m just wondering, how you think about those two buckets being that they are similar in size, and you know the concern you might have on even pricing at that 2% plus level. Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Yes, it\u2019s a good point in that I don\u2019t want to oversimplify how we look at pricing. We have to look at to your point beyond just food away from home as one piece of information. Food at home exactly as you mentioned is clearly below food away from home right now. And so, we look at food inflation in total because we need to make sure that kind of home is the competitor and people could be leaving us if you will to eat more at home.","But we have to look at all costs, both food and labor to determine pricing and it also comes into play of what our competitors are doing, the demographics of where we are, so there is a lot of things that go into determining pricing. I don\u2019t know if I can pick one or another as far as what I\u2019d rather have labor or food be high cost if you will.","Steve Easterbrook","Just one point I would add to that Jeff is whilst we will clearly build an assumption into our plans because that\u2019s how we set our plans, we don\u2019t make a single pricing decision just once a year we make decisions across the year. So we can always guage the consumer, consumer confidence where our costs are going and where the competitive environment is and do our best clearly to make the right decision. So it\u2019s -- we have multiple opportunities across the year to reassess and make sure that we are certainly seizing the opportunity but without being -- taking it too far.","Chris Stent","We have time for one more question and it will be from Jason West of Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Yes, thanks guys. Just on the market share number, can you give the two components of that you know the McDonald's number and the equivalent calculation and then the industry number that you saw to get to the 29 and then see just big picture on that sort of same store sales, trajectory. You know we\u2019ve been dealing with challenging markets around the world, it feels like for several years now and you guys are starting to see momentum despite that but if feels like the volatility and the challenges only can be get worse each year, so how does that affect you guys going forward, do you think we\u2019re still kind of an environment we\u2019ve been in or have things you know externally maybe gotten a bit worse? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Like in terms of the market share takes then we would take across the pretty much the 14 week period, but our growth would be at 5.7% in the QSR sandwich segment ex-McDonald's would be 2.8 giving us the differential of 2.9. So, overall growth in the market we were outperforming that clearly.","In terms of around the world, we want to be careful that we don\u2019t sound too anxious and create concern around the headwinds and what have you, because there is so much of our ability to grow is in our own hands. And you know we are really focussing on what we can control. I mean, we have noticed and we have a history of being successful in many many countries around the world through strong economic times as well as challenging economics times as long as we do the right thing about the customer.","So overall, we are confident heading into this year. We\u2019ve been through the plan in detail of our largest nine or ten markets, and I\u2019m confident they will deliver the growth to a level that we are satisfied and we are challenging ourselves hard on it. I also want to be pragmatic.","In France in the moment for example, it\u2019s tough, IEOs decreased for five years in a row. So if you are going to grow the business, you really have to take a significant amount of share in the declining market for that to translate into topline growth. And to do that you don\u2019t want to free yourself out of your longer term strategy and the brand building they have done.","So, I think there are some realities and it is right for us just to be a little cautious about, but if I take a look at the collective across the U.S., across the lead markets and the high growth markets, you know we are building plans and certainly on a consolidated basis with an expectation of growing.","So -- but as you will know from the markets even the start of this year, volatility just creates a scrappier environment and a little bit of nervousness whether its across investor community and sometimes in certain markets across customers. So we need to be mindful or sensitive to that, you know China is a good example where you know that kind of volatility in the market place just create a little bit of anxiety. So that\u2019s why we want to reinforce our confidence in that market in growing our core business as well as incremental units and new store of growth.","So we're mindful. We stay close. But we remain quietly confident.","Chris Stent","We\u2019re at the top of the hour, so I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve with a few closing comments.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, Chris. And again thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. 2015 was a year of change. We are running McDonald's differently and building on our unique advantages as we strive to become a modern and progressive burger company. Our fourth quarter results reflect the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made. And whilst there is more work to be done, we are on the right path. We are focussed on our customers and delivering what matters most to them. Hot fresh food, fast friendly service, in a contemporary environment, all are the value of McDonald's. I am confident in our ability to sustain a positive momentum as we continue to execute our turnaround plans into 2016, and I\u2019m excited about our longer term opportunities to strengthen our business and reassert McDonald's as the global leader we know we are.","Thanks, and everyone have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator instructions.]","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, vice president of investor relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin","Thank you, and hello, everybody. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer Don Thompson and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast, and podcast.","And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available at our website www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Good morning everyone, and thank you, Kathy. In July, we talked about three lenses through which we\u2019re framing our performance. We talked about the past, the present, and the future. Today, I want to talk about the present and the future.","We\u2019re focused on the actions that we are taking to drive current performance in an environment that is pressuring growth, and we\u2019ll discuss how those actions will position us to deliver results in the near and the longer terms.","Today, our business continues to grow, as demonstrated by third quarter performance. While global comparable sales of 0.9% were not as high as we\u2019d like, operating income grew 6% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.52, a 7% increase in constant currencies.","Even though our comp sales lap eases in the fourth quarter, macroeconomic and competitive conditions are not expected to change dramatically. As a result, we expect October sales to be relatively flat.","Around the world, we are accelerating those initiatives that we believe will have the greatest impact on our customers within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and broaden consumers\u2019 access to our brand. We\u2019re also thoughtfully adapting local market plans to remain relevant and appealing at a time when consumers are uncertain and the industry is stagnant.","We continue to intensify our focus on the most critical tenets of the customer experience: the strength in our performance, menu quality and choice, customer service, affordability, and consumer engagement. I\u2019d like to briefly discuss each one of these.","Regarding menu quality and choice, we must ensure that the true quality of our ingredients and food recipes are better known to all consumers, and that customers have choices across our menu to meet their taste desires and\/or nutritional expectations. This includes featuring relevant and appealing new food and beverage news.","Next, customer service. Simply stated, we must exceed our customers\u2019 expectations for fast, accurate, and friendly service at each and every one of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world. And furthermore, those restaurants must be clean, well-maintained, and contemporary.","The third point is affordability. We need to offer compelling value options across all price tiers of our menu. And lastly, deepening [unintelligible]. This means creating stronger awareness and excitement around our menu and around our restaurants while further revealing the ways in which we\u2019re a good neighbor in communities around the world.","We know that meeting customers\u2019 expectations in all of these areas is critically important to a great experience at McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019ll talk more about these tenets, including specific examples of actions we\u2019re taking around the world to elevate the McDonald\u2019s experience at next month\u2019s investor meeting on November 14.","So let\u2019s take a look at the business across the globe, starting with the U.S. U.S. comparable sales were up 0.7% for the quarter, and operating income increased 5%. Our current sales performance was driven by a focus on bringing new and familiar taste to customers, exciting promotions, and an ongoing emphasis on affordability across our menu.","We accelerated the timing of our Monopoly promotion in an effort to further increase awareness and encourage trial of recent new product introductions like Quarter Pounder line sandwiches and the new McWraps. Monopoly also reminds customers about our core menu classics. It drives traffic and builds average check while also engaging customers in a fun and familiar game experience that\u2019s only available at McDonald\u2019s.","We also introduced Mighty Wings in the third quarter as a limited time offer. This [bold] (ph) new flavor addition to our U.S. menu originated in China and Hong Kong and has encouraged trade up to increase average check. While overall performance of Monopoly and Mighty Wings met our internal targets, it was not strong enough to offset current guest count trends.","Our promotions and new products are complemented by our consistent value approach to offer affordable variety and choice across the menu. The Dollar Menu remains core to our high-low strategy, with products like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger and the popular McChicken continuing to generate strong demand at the $1 price point.","As we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of the Dollar Menu, we\u2019re leveraging the equity we\u2019ve built to ensure we continue to satisfy our customers\u2019 expectations for affordability. The new Dollar Menu and More platform is designed to provide every day predictable value beyond the $1 price point and will be supported with the weight of our national advertising. The sandwich lineup, which ranges from $1 to $2 adds new flavors and tastes to complement our existing favorites and provides additional pricing flexibility for the McDouble.","In addition to the launch of Dollar Menu and More, we\u2019re balancing proven favorites with new tastes that add further excitement and variety to our menu. The return of the popular McRib sandwich and the Southwest Premium McWrap are examples of this flavorful balance that will be seen in restaurants within the United States.","Now let\u2019s turn to Europe, where comparable sales were up 20 basis points for the quarter and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. These results reflect strong performance in the U.K. and Russia and solid performance in France. Negative trends in Germany continue amidst the highly competitive environment.","The U.K.\u2019s business momentum remained strong, and we continued to grow market share. This growth has been supported by our expanded beverage lineup and an ongoing breakfast focus. This month, we\u2019re launching Mocha in the U.K. and using this opportunity to introduce the McCafe brand across our entire range of espresso-based coffees. Following the successful launch of McCafe iced smoothies and frappes over the summer, this represents a significant step in our journey to become a beverage destination in the U.K.","Russia delivered positive performance in the third quarter despite the lower inflationary environment that continues to limit our ability to take price. Successful food offers such as Tastes of the Season and the Ciabatta Beef Burger helped boost results for the quarter.","France also delivered positive results for the quarter, marking its first positive quarter of comparable sales since the third quarter of 2012. The market continues to grow share in a contracting and [unintelligible] industry. A core menu focus, supported by strong marketing execution and an ongoing emphasis on affordability helped to drive our performance.","The Big Tasty re-hit in September generated strong demand and the Classic Return campaign, which launched in August, proved to be successful drivers of France\u2019s performance during the quarter. Additionally, Petit Plaisirs and Casse Croute continue to do well by providing attractive offers at affordable price points. While we\u2019re pleased with these results, we\u2019re cautious about recent performance, especially given the volatility in France\u2019s economy.","Germany\u2019s performance remains weak, as negative comparable sales and traffic trends continued through the third quarter. Competitive activity remains aggressive, and the decline in IEO category persists as the industry grapples with price-sensitive consumers. Today, affordability and specifically price value is key in Germany. We continue to evolve the balance between our base value and premium offers across the menu to address the near term needs of the marketplace.","Now let\u2019s move over to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 1.4% for the quarter, and operating income decreased 4% in constant currencies. Performance across our big three markets remains challenging. This reflects tough macroeconomic conditions along with the performance of recent new products and promotions that were unable to overcome our current negative guest count momentum.","Across APMEA, we remain focused on driving performance through consistent price value offers, accelerating growth at key day parts, particularly breakfast and overnight, and by leveraging brand extensions to enhance the service and convenience of the McDonald\u2019s experience.","Australia continues to balance new product news and strong promotional activity to appeal to customers in a highly competitive environment. Looking ahead, Australia is targeting opportunities in chicken and the family business to broaden customer appeal.","Japan\u2019s negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. We\u2019re committed to making improvements to our value platform in the near term in an effort to appeal to consumers who remain extremely price sensitive in this deflationary environment. At the same time, we\u2019re introducing new products and promotions to create excitement and attract customers into our restaurants.","In China, comparable sales were down 3.2% for the quarter. As a key emerging market, China has significant long term opportunities across all three of our growth priorities. We\u2019re also evolving our value platform to give it a greater reach across day parts and meal occasions. At the same time, we\u2019re using limited time offers and promotions to create energy around new menu news, and we\u2019re leveraging brand extensions like kiosks and McCafes to reach our customers when, where, and how they want the McDonald\u2019s experience the most.","Around the world, we remain focused on our customers. It\u2019s our top priority to deliver an experience that meets their evolving tastes and lifestyles. We recognize the opportunities that exist to profitably grow our business for the immediate and the longer term.","We remain committed to making disciplined investments to fuel future growth and further differentiate Brand McDonald\u2019s. Our efforts to broaden accessibility through new restaurants and to modernize the customer experience by reinvesting in existing restaurants, including reimaging, technology, and convenience initiatives, remains a top priority.","Consistent with our longstanding priorities regarding the use of cash, after investing in our business, we\u2019re committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, first through dividends and then share repurchases. In fact, we recently announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share, bringing the annual dividend to $3.24.","Combined with our share repurchases, we expect our total cash return to shareholders for 2013 to be between $4.5 billion and $5 billion. In times like these, our ability to stay focused on those factors within our control is absolutely critical. As important is our ability to look within, to understand what\u2019s working, what needs to change, and why and we must execute.","Our decentralized local markets have the ability to test their plans and quickly course correct based on customer reactions. This is even more important in this environment because it allows us to identify the right tactics that resonate with consumers and that will drive our performance in the near and longer terms.","Our culture is built on the premise of always putting the customer first, making them feel good about visiting McDonald\u2019s today and into the future. Our ability to deliver on that promise through our actions will enable us to deliver long term value for our system and for our shareholders.","Thanks again, everyone. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Pete.","Peter Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Our performance in third quarter speaks to the resiliency of our business model and our ongoing commitment to invest strategically and grow our business over the long term through a balanced approach of adding new units and increasing sales at existing restaurants.","Despite modest comparable sales growth, McDonald\u2019s was able to achieve solid growth in revenues and income. While the growth has not been as high as recent years, we are confident in our ability to deliver significant shareholder value over time.","Through the first nine months, revenues increased 2% and our combined operating margin increased 10 basis points to 31.2%, primarily due to higher franchise margin dollars and lower G&A expenses.","With 81% of our nearly 35,000 restaurants franchised, our profitability is primarily driven by franchise margins. In the third quarter, franchise margins reached about $2 billion, an increase of 4%, or nearly $70 million in constant currencies, with each area of the world contributing to this growth. The franchise margin percentage for the quarter declined 40 basis points to 83% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy costs.","Global company operated margins totaled $919 million for the quarter, and were relatively flat in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 40 basis points to 18.7% as weaker performance in the U.S. and APMEA offset gains in Europe.","In the U.S., third quarter company operated margins declined 140 basis points to 18.4% due to higher operating and commodity costs. Commodity costs increased about 2.5% in the third quarter, with similar pressure expected in the fourth quarter. We have tightened our full year estimates and now project 2013 commodity costs in the U.S. to be up 1.5% to 2%.","We have taken three price increases year to date, with the most recent increase in September totaling about 1%. This brings our total increase to about 2.6%, which is relatively consistent with a year ago. We are at the midpoint of the projected 2% to 3% full year increase for food away from home inflation. Food at home inflation has been running at about a point lower, so we are keeping a close eye on this measure as well as we consider future price moves.","In Europe, third quarter company operated margins increased 70 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to the strength of our two largest McOpCo markets, Russia and the U.K. These two markets contribute nearly half of Europe\u2019s company operated margin dollars.","In addition, France, the third-largest market in terms of McOpCo margin dollars, contributed through positive comparable sales and certain labor efficiencies, most of which we don\u2019t expect to realize in the fourth quarter.","Commodities increased about 1% for the quarter. Europe has also lowered its full year projected increase to 1.5% to 2%. Our price increases varied across the 39 European markets. Excluding Russia, most European markets are averaging year over year price increases around 1.5%.","As we consider future price increases, we remain mindful of the economic uncertainty, cautious consumer sentiment, increased taxation, and lower disposable income. Our global strategy and approach to pricing remains unchanged. We continue to balance our goal of driving traffic and market share gains while effectively managing the impact of rising costs and evolving consumer trends.","Turning to Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 160 basis points to 15.3%, primarily due to higher labor costs across the segment as well as new restaurant openings, mainly in China. For a perspective, China represents approximately 30% of APMEA\u2019s company operated margin dollars.","Our G&A expense in the quarter declined 11% or more than $66 million versus a year ago. This was primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation and lapping the sponsorship of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games last summer. For the full year, we now expect G&A to be down 2% to 3% in constant currencies.","Solid, consistent financial performance from our unique business model generates meaningful amounts of cash flow. We strategically reinvest a significant amount of this cash back into our business to drive future growth and returns. Our restaurant development teams are making good progress against their plans for building new restaurants and reimaging existing locations, taking advantage of improved tools and capabilities.","We have trimmed our 2013 capital expenditure estimate to $3 billion. This is a conscious decision to delay a limited number of new openings into 2014 based on current conditions. We feel this is prudent given the short term pressures and our desire to maximize the quality of our new openings.","We continue to generate strong returns at new restaurants in mature markets with emerging markets like China historically achieving our benchmarks within three to four years. In 2013, we expect to open about 1,500 new restaurants, ending the year at over 35,000. New openings by are of the world include over 225 in the U.S., about 300 in Europe, and more than 750 in APMEA. Approximately one-third of our global openings are in development of license or affiliated markets where we do not invest our capital.","We also continue to modernize our existing restaurant base through reimaging more than 1,600 restaurants this year. Globally, about two-thirds of our interiors and over half of our exteriors reflect the current contemporary look.","Let\u2019s now turn to foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted third quarter results by $0.01. At current exchange rates, including the euro at the $1.35\/$1.36 level, we expect full year EPS to be negatively impacted by about $0.05 to $0.06, which implies a fourth quarter negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02. Please take this as directional only, given the volatility in exchange rates.","Lastly, I\u2019d like to comment on our expectations for the remainder of this year. On the first quarter call in April, I said that we expected company operated margins to be pressured throughout 2013, though the margin decline should be less pronounced than in the first quarter, as sales comparisons ease in upcoming quarters.","Let me give you an update. Though sales comparisons have eased and will continue to do so, our current sales trends are a stronger predictor of future performance than prior year comparisons. As a result, based on what we know today, we expect fourth quarter global comparable sales performance to be in line with recent quarterly trends and restaurant margin percentage declines, both McOpCo and franchised, to be at a level relatively similar to first quarter declines.","We\u2019re wrapping up our planning cycle over the next few weeks, and we look forward to sharing some of our 2014 outlook with you at our November investor meeting next month.","The McDonald\u2019s system remains focused on building our business to generate enduring, profitable growth for our shareholders, franchisees, and suppliers. Our third quarter results speak to the benefit of our geographic diversification and the many levers we have to generate top and bottom line growth.","We are confident in our ability to successfully navigate this environment while preserving our competitive advantages and positioning the brand to participate fully when consumer spending improves.","Thank you. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Kathy Martin","Thanks, Keith, I\u2019ll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question is from Joe Buckley with Bank of America.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I\u2019m going to ask a very near-term question. Looking at the year ago October performance, this comparison looks pretty easy and obviously you\u2019re guiding to a relatively flat number. So I\u2019m curious if things have worsened yet, if perhaps the government shutdown and debt ceiling discussions may have impacted U.S. business or sort of what drove that?","And then kind of a related question, the margins held up fairly well, very, very well. They were actually up in Europe this quarter. So why the greater margin deterioration in the fourth quarter? Is there something unusual going on?","Don Thompson ","I\u2019ll take the first part, and then I\u2019ll ask Pete to speak to your question relative to margins. Regarding October, and it\u2019s really October in the fourth quarter, we expect the fourth quarter to remain challenged based on some of the existing top line pressures that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re seeing flat or declining IEO markets and heightened competitive activity across all the geographies.","And even though the comp sales lapped \u2013 do ease in the fourth quarter, heightened macroeconomic and competitive pressures are not expected to change dramatically as we said. In Europe, we\u2019ve got less pricing power than we had a year ago, and consumer psyche is affected by both the economies and also some of the upcoming austerity measures, VAT pressures, etc.","In the U.S., we continue to experience a bifurcation of the consumer base. McDonald\u2019s core customers skew towards those customers whose disposable income is not rising as much and are spending a little bit less in QSR. And so as we look at those things, as we look at the macroeconomic conditions that persist in APMEA and across APMEA, we believe that this fourth quarter is still going to be relatively challenged as we mentioned.","Regarding the government and the shutdown, you asked a question about that, actually for us at McDonald\u2019s, the impact is limited to a few different areas. One would be communities with large federal employees and those populations where a lot of the consumers there, their purchasing power may be limited based upon the government shutdown if the government employees or impacted by it.","Another is from a supply chain perspective, in port authorities, when things like that happen from an impact perspective, the port authorities are operating at reduced level, so that changes the importation processing times for some of the products that we may have.","And lastly, it\u2019s things like the e-Verify program, Federal e-Verify program, when it\u2019s closed down and the impact it has relative to hiring processes, so you can see that outside of that first one, which really gets into population impact, it\u2019s fairly minimal at this point relative to what\u2019s taking place from a government perspective.","Peter Bensen","And regarding margins, you pointed out exactly the difference between the third quarter and our outlook for the fourth quarter and that was Europe. The two markets that really had the biggest impact on that improvement in the third quarter in Europe were Russia and France. Combined, they basically contributed to 70 basis points of growth. While the U.K. had growth, it was pretty much offset by the other markets.","And France, we had some exceptional labor efficiencies due to their higher sales levels in the quarter that we don\u2019t expect in the fourth quarter. And in Russia, we had a true-up of some of their distribution costs that resulted in a credit that added some improvement to the margins there. Last year, that true-up happened in the fourth quarter, so their margins in the fourth quarter were a little higher last year based on that. So on a comparative basis, we don\u2019t get that benefit.","So at the end of the day, based on the current sales trends and the lack of a couple of these unusual items, we don\u2019t expect there to be that growth in Europe margins in the fourth quarter leading the consolidated margins to be more in line with the declines we saw first quarter.","Kathy Martin ","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley ","My question\u2019s on the U.S. It sounds like you\u2019re saying that the promotions you\u2019ve run the last couple of months have been sort of in line with what you expected, but the underlying business is just so weak, and I just wanted to challenge that.","Can you sort of back up why you think these promotions have been effective, because they seem like they\u2019re not driving incremental traffic to the business? Are you focusing too much on the short term for example whereas remember in prior periods you were winning from a position of strength?","And can you also just talk about the Dollar and More menu? It didn\u2019t seem to work a couple of years ago, because the consumers still thought dollar meant dollar, not more. So why does that work this time do you think?","Don Thompson ","I\u2019ll talk a little bit about both of the areas. Relative to promotions, actually the promotions themselves have been within the range of our expectations. As an example, if I look at Mighty Wings, Mighty Wings resonated with consumers but performed at the lower end of our expectations, and your comment about overall base and base trendlines was very accurate. When you see the overall industry being a bit softer, it does impact our ability for us to drive sales to a higher level.","But when it speaks specifically to the wings, there were a couple of things that, although it performed within our targeted expectation range, again at the lower end, there\u2019s a couple of things we can improve on, one is still affordability. $1 per wing was still not considered to be the most competitive in the current environment. The other thing we saw, and it\u2019s a very slight modification, but the flavor profile was slightly spicy for some consumers.","But having said that, what\u2019s interesting is we sold or expect to sell probably about 35 million pounds of wings. We can address the challenges with spice, or as we look forward, price, you will see wings again in the U.S. business. It has been successful for us. But it is at a time when the overall environment is a bit softer. They create trade-up as most of the products that we\u2019ve introduced have done.","Remember that as we went into this year, one of the things we wanted to do was to make sure that we had an innovative food pipeline, but we did not want to forget core classics, and we have tried to do that. Monopoly helped us again with that. The other thing we wanted to do is make sure we remained affordable. And we\u2019ve been working on this around the globe. And that part I feel we still are operating from a position of strength in most of our markets. Markets where we have challenges, we\u2019re addressing those challenges in those markets.","And so all in all, we\u2019re doing the things that I think we should do to position ourselves to grow this business. As the economy does come back a bit, we know that we\u2019ll benefit from that. But we\u2019re also not going to sit back and just wait. We are doing many things tactically to try to address the current environment, but we\u2019re not missing out on a long-term environment as well.","The other piece I want to mention real quick is the notion of Dollar Menu and More. And we have not tried Dollar Menu and More. One of the things that was attempted a while ago was something that was called an Extra Value Menu. This is very, very different. Dollar Menu and More means that you keep the Dollar Menu price points, and it\u2019s consistent with how we have continued to evolve the Dollar Menu, since its inception back in the early 2000.","Over time, we have changed some of the products on the Dollar Menu as we\u2019ve needed to. We changed from a Big N\u2019 Tasty initially to a Double Cheeseburger, from Double Cheeseburger to McDouble, so we\u2019ve always evolved the dollar menu. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now, that continued evolution.","But what we\u2019ve also found is the need to have a $2 price point for some products that are a slight trade up from just the dollar-based price points that also supports additional margin growth in the restaurants, and it gives customers a value ladder of sorts, so that based upon their discretionary spending, they have multiple offers at McDonald\u2019s.","We also have a $5 price point, which really speaks to things like 20-piece nuggets. And so there\u2019s varying levels of affordability, and we still continue to have our Extra Value Meals and premium-based products that we\u2019ll talk to.","So we\u2019ve definitely not forgotten our core, and the core classics of Big Mac and Quarter Pounders and Fish Filet, and those things you\u2019ll continue to see. We haven\u2019t forgotten the innovative food pipeline, McWraps, Mighty Wings, etc. And for us, we most definitely haven\u2019t forgotten our affordability platform with the Dollar Menu. So all of those things will play well together as we continue to come up with the most compelling menu offerings and compelling calendar for customers moving forward.","Kathy Martin ","Next question\u2019s from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays ","Question on the longer term business model. I\u2019ll preface it by saying beyond 2014, because I do know you have an analyst day coming up, where we\u2019ll get some color on that. But could you just maybe offer us some insight longer term? You mentioned the franchise business, 81% worldwide. Just wondering whether there\u2019s still an opportunity to push that? Obviously you still have huge skin in the game, but with 35,000 units, I\u2019m wondering whether over time the idea might not be to push that to 85% or 90%.","And as a related question, the capex, I know you mentioned you tweaked it down in terms of dollars and modestly in terms of the unit openings, I\u2019m wondering whether that\u2019s at all a sign of future - I know you talk about maybe accelerating the pace of openings and whether this tweak might not be to signal that maybe things are slowing a little bit, or maybe you want to shift to more remodels and less new units. So, how you think about that.","Peter Bensen ","I\u2019ll talk about the capex, and Don will probably have a perspective on the franchising percentages. Really, the change in our capex this year has really been a short term thing. It speaks nothing about our view of the future. As we look at the environment, most of the unit cuts have come from China and some of the emerging markets in APMEA. So virtually all of the dollar variance from our original budget to our revised outlook is coming from APMEA.","Europe will be on their opening budget, U.S. and the other areas of the world will hit. So it\u2019s really in China and some of these emerging markets where we\u2019re looking at where the projects were. In a lot of these countries, we rely in other retail development and housing development and some of the other development activity in the marketplace to create the traffic generators. And if they\u2019re delayed or behind schedule, there\u2019s been years where we would go ahead and open the restaurants anyway, knowing that that demand would be coming.","And this year we\u2019re just taking a little more prudent look at those kind of projects in light of the sales environment, to say, you know what, we\u2019ll hold off and wait for those traffic generators to open or those projects to continue before we\u2019ll open the restaurant. So it\u2019s really just some fine tuning and not an indication of going forward we\u2019re looking to change our capex mix more toward reimaging and backing off of openings. We still think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity to grow to the market potential in several of these countries by opening new units.","Don Thompson ","And relative to franchising, as we move forward, your point is appropriate, we continue to look at opportunities. So today we\u2019re 81% franchised globally, 19% company operated. We continue, particularly across areas we\u2019re growing in such as APMEA, we\u2019ll be continuing to leverage our DLs, to look for new DLs as we\u2019re doing across China. We\u2019re continuing to move forward conventional franchisees and conventional licensing. And so we continue to do that. APMEA will continue to see more franchising across the market.","In addition to that, we\u2019re also looking at the mature markets and existing markets, where there are opportunities for us to effectively franchise as we continue to grow the business. And so yes, we will continue to definitely look at franchising, franchise opportunities. And you\u2019ll see it more particularly across APMEA.","Kathy Martin ","Our next question is from Michael Kelter with Goldman Sachs.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you, it\u2019s [Ivan Holman] sitting in for Michael. I was just wondering, the Dollar Menu itself has represented, historically, 13% to 14% of sales. Can you please give us a little bit of guidance on how you see that evolving in the near term, as well as from a longer term perspective in terms of how you see the business model over the next couple of years? And within that context, how do you think franchisees might be receptive to a change of that percentage, either up or down?","Don Thompson ","Just relative to the Dollar Menu, I think that we will continue to look first at customers, and customer behaviors, and affordability. And what we\u2019ve always done is leverage that data and then as we had discussions with the franchisee body, to look at what\u2019s going to be the most compelling offering for McDonald\u2019s. And again, the Dollar Menu\u2019s only a part of that.","We continue to see and believe that it will continue to represent somewhere in that same percentile, 13% to 15%. As we stretch out the Dollar Menu a little bit more with Dollar Menu or More and provide some additional offers that will be even more appealing to customers, we believe that it will continue to be a compelling offer, and still best-in-class when we look at the overall marketplace.","And so that part will remain the same. Franchisees have been a part of the discussions. They always are as we look at making decisions like this one.","Kathy Martin ","The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird ","Don, I think you mentioned in your initial remarks that you\u2019re focusing or have been focusing on what\u2019s working well around the globe, and what needs to change. So I was particularly interested in maybe the last part of that. What do you think needs to change going forward? And perhaps if you could give us some examples of some maybe bigger picture or more meaningful changes as you look out to next year, or even the following year, just as you\u2019re planning your business.","Don Thompson ","I\u2019ll start at the back end of that and then go into what needs to change. I think as we look at next year, clearly the areas of, we call it the three global opportunities that we have, those things will remain the same. And so we\u2019re still focused on making sure that we have the best menu across the board for customers. We\u2019ll continue to balance that between the core classics and favorites with new products, and we\u2019ll continue to enhance that relative to the nutritional offerings that we have. So that\u2019s been a focal point, and that has been working around the world.","The modernizing customer experience is something we\u2019ve been focused on and that really deals with our reimaging and making sure the restaurants are contemporary. That part has been received well by customers. We continue to do that. The strong portion of that, and Pete mentioned it, is that when you look across Europe, Europe is much further ahead there. So we won\u2019t have to do as many globally, but we\u2019ll leverage what we do need to do to make sure we are a compelling offer to customers around the world.","Technology is going to be a big part of our future, particularly digital engagement with consumers. And so you\u2019ll hear us and see us talk much more about digital engagement with consumers. The other thing that you\u2019ll see change a bit is we are being much stronger relative to communicating about our brand, communicating about our food. Customers want to hear more about transparency. They want to hear about provenance and where the food is from. So those things we\u2019re very proud of at McDonald\u2019s, and we\u2019ll continue.","At the November 14 NIM meeting, we\u2019ll discuss more about some of these opportunities. When it comes to changes, we\u2019ll chat a little bit about that in November as well, but frankly we\u2019ve got a few markets where we have opportunities and we\u2019ve been, again, very transparent about those.","In Japan, we\u2019ve got to get consistent value, and it\u2019s a deflationary environment and a tough market, so we\u2019re focused on that. We\u2019ve had some leadership changes in Japan and we continue to look at the opportunities we have in that marketplace.","Germany is a market that we are also focused on solidifying the balance between premium and the value based offerings. We fluctuated a bit there, possibly too much, and we need to shore that up.","Australia we\u2019re focused in a very competitive environment, on making sure we have that same balance. And in the U.S. we\u2019ve got a great food pipeline now. We\u2019re focused well on the operational base of what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace. And those things, again, you\u2019ll get to hear a little bit more about at the NIM meeting in November, but those are some of the areas and some of the markets that we\u2019re focused more intently on.","Kathy Martin ","Our next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the value menu domestically. Do you feel like you\u2019re winning that value game here in the U.S.? And then is that a segment that can actually drive sales and profits higher? Or do you think more or less that the dollar menu as it is is maybe something that helps you hold those guest counts in place in a tough environment and it takes more the success on those higher end of those more premium items to really return to stronger same-store sales and profit growth?","Don Thompson ","Great question, and the answer is yes. The dollar menu definitely, particularly in times like these, where you see consumers stressed a little more from a discretionary spending perspective, and you see a bit of bifurcation relative to the economic strata in the U.S., it\u2019s very important to have that affordability platform and the dollar menu that we have. So it does keep a base of customers. Keep this in mind, while it only represents 13% of 15% of sales historically, you\u2019ve got about a third of the customers that will leverage that dollar menu in some form or fashion. And so it is a strength part of the base.","Having said that, we also have to have core news, and the core has to be affordable at a value menu price point, and premium based news whether that be McWraps or Might Wings. Those are promotional, those are limited time offers. But those things help not only with margin, but they help with the excitement for customers, so there\u2019s something new and exciting at McDonald\u2019s.","And so we have to be able to balance both of those two ends of the barbell, if you will. And also, I would say we have to fill in what\u2019s in between. That\u2019s the reason for Dollar Menu and More. We\u2019ve talked about $2 price points with sandwiches that have a few additional things to offer than our base value dollar menu offerings do.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.","Matt DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets","Just looking at the franchise margins in the guidance, I appreciate the guidance you give given the volatility we\u2019re seeing in the comps and everything for the current quarter that we\u2019re in now. Can you just sort of give us some sort of what you expect in trends for \u201914, especially with the franchise side of the margins? Is there anything structural that you\u2019re doing as far as relief plans or anything that might continue into \u201914 that you can give us an outlook on now? Or is it just simply comps coming back and the franchise margins improving in step with the comps?","Peter Bensen ","We will get into 2014 in a little more detail in November, but essentially there\u2019s nothing structural that\u2019s changing. As you\u2019ve pointed out, and we continue to mention, it is really a top line game, and our franchise margins are even more sensitive to comp, because a great proportion of the costs in that line are fixed. So when we generate higher comps, we get the significant leverage.","The only thing structural that\u2019s been going on the last couple of years has been our contribution toward reimaging with franchisees, so as we coinvest with them, we continue to get greater amounts of depreciation, but again, with comp sales increases, that should not be a barrier to the margin growth. But as you point out, in this current environment, we\u2019re not getting that top line, so we don\u2019t expect the franchise margin to grow in the fourth quarter.","Kathy Martin ","The next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Mike [Tamis] - Oppenheimer","This is Mike [Tamis] on for Brian. Is there anything in G&A that can be cut if sales trends continue to underperform? And then if there are any quick comments you can give on the China business of why that continues to struggle.","Peter Bensen ","I\u2019ll talk about G&A and Don maybe can give a perspective on China. When we look at our total G&A mix, what we\u2019re doing in this current environment is really looking at what are the discretionary items that we can kind of pull as levers to moderate short term performance. So, travel, meetings, open head count, things like that are things that we look at in environments like this. But at the end of the day, we\u2019re about growing this business for the long term.","And so we\u2019re going to continue to make investments in things like technology, especially digital that Don mentioned. We\u2019re going to continue to make investments in our restaurant development teams and in the tools and processes to continue to grow restaurants. So as we look forward, there\u2019s no dramatic restructuring or anything like that that\u2019s going to happen, and we\u2019re going to continue to invest our G&A in the areas that we think are good for the long term growth of the business.","Don Thompson ","Relative to China, I\u2019ll give a bit of an overall perspective as to what we\u2019re seeing at least and then just a little insight as to McDonald\u2019s business as well. There is and has been, as you all know, a slowing of the economy. The GDP is at its slowest growth level in 23 years, and that\u2019s causing a little bit of a credit crunch across China. Slight decline in consumer confidence that goes along with that as consumer sentiment is very cautious, is the way I would describe it.","GDP is expected to be in the mid-sevens for the rest of the year. Typically anything below an 8% is a bit concerning, but nonetheless we do see, across China, some bright spots and for the long term, definitely see a bright opportunity in China.","Today, IEO is flat to declining. That makes it a little bit more difficult for growth. And the Chinese typically, in tougher economic times, they typically revert to what we would call CQSR, Chinese QSR, noodle shops, etc., than they do Western QSR-based companies.","So these are things and phases we\u2019ve seen before. We\u2019re solidifying our affordability and opportunities to reach the customers with some of the products that we have. Breakfast has performed positively for us in the marketplace. We\u2019ve got a broader strategy around how we engage Millennials and own the night, as we call it, because that\u2019s a big opportunity for us. And again, we continue to look at our menu mix across the board.","One last point, and that is Pete mentioned G&A, and we get asked about it quite a bit. One other thing I would add is I would keep in mind that our compensation - so when we talk about a savings in G&A based upon performance based incentives or performance based compensation, if we are not hitting the expectations we have in sales and operating income, then that compensation is at risk.","And that is a good balance. It\u2019s a good hedge within our overall formulas and the way we operate as McDonald\u2019s. And so we constantly look at our G&A to make sure we\u2019re making prudent investments for the future, and those investments yielding appropriate returns for our shareholders.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks, it\u2019s [Ahmod Gallan] filling in. Can you address some specifics or concerns on how your speed of service and operations scores in the U.S. have trended over the past year given some of the changes in menu? You\u2019ve had the new POS in place for I think almost a couple of years now, and other aspects like scaling up dual drive throughs, but are there any specific opportunities that you\u2019ve identified for further improvement in 2014?","Don Thompson ","There are quite a few things that we continue to look at. Clearly service for us, as I mentioned in my opening comments, is a critical performance factor and an experience factor for customers. When we add something like a dual-lane drive through, on a per-car basis, if you looked at flowthrough speed, we typically will see a couple second increase in a flowthrough kind of a measure, because you now have two lanes and they split off. For an individual customer, they get attended to quicker and the absolute times that we see tend to be overall shorter for the experience. And so the dual lane drive through has helped, and it has helped us with capacity.","When we implement new products, there\u2019s always a softer period upon the launch of the new products, and then there\u2019s a recovery. The more ingredients in a product, yes that will impact service times, but our operating platform of made for you basically enables us to be able to implement those types of products.","So I would tell you at this point the operational focus is strong. There are different measures that come through each and every year relative to customer satisfaction. What we\u2019re focused on is our internal measures of whether or not we\u2019re satisfying the needs of customers from a fast perspective, an accuracy perspective, and then I will tell you the quality of that service and the friendliness of that interaction.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is Sara Senatore with Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","I wanted to step back if I could and just ask you about the demand environment and your results. And I guess if I think back to the recession, \u201908 to \u201909, your comps were better and certainly a lot better than your competitors vis-\u00e0-vis where they are today. And I think it would be hard for us to say that the demand environment was a whole lot better back then than is the case now.","So I was just hoping you could help me just diagnose is the issue your competitors are a lot better? Is the issue that you don\u2019t have quite as much of a sales layer opportunity? Just maybe if you can help me compare and contrast. And then a related question is how are your franchisees doing in this environment? Obviously there\u2019s always some talk in the media about McDonald\u2019s relationships, and I just wanted to get your take on that.","Don Thompson ","Just having been the president in the U.S. when we went through this back in 2008 to 2009, I would tell you things that were similar and some that were different. Clearly there was a, from a consumer discretionary spending perspective, it was a very timid if not restricted environment.","Having said that, though, the competition at that point was not as strong from a pure price perspective. We had just evolved our dollar menu, just as we\u2019re talking about doing now with Dollar Menu and More. We had just completed that evolution. As you all may recall, we went from a Double Cheeseburger to a McDouble, and we talked about snack wraps a little more strongly.","So we were talking about affordability in the same way that we\u2019re doing now, and plan to do even more so in the U.S. business. We had just begun really focusing on the coffee opportunity. I think you\u2019ll hear more about the coffee opportunity, as it still does exist, and you\u2019ll hear more about that at the NIM meeting.","And so those things are fairly consistent in terms of how we approach it. Again, definitely more competition in the marketplace. We\u2019re getting back to that focus on the value, the coffee, and those interim pieces. I would tell you we had a pretty decent product innovation at that point, and I think that what you\u2019ve seen this past year is getting us back on track with that in the U.S. as well.","Relative to the franchisees, I was just recently at our national leadership council meeting as they meet with the U.S. leadership team. And I\u2019ve not seen as strong an alignment in quite a few years. I think everyone understands the environment that we\u2019re facing. They also understand the legislative environment that we\u2019re facing. Those things cause us at McDonald\u2019s to really consolidate our different needs and desires and really focus on the customer.","And so that\u2019s what they were doing, and I left there feeling pretty good about what I was seeing and sensing from the operator leadership group and from our U.S. leadership team, and them all being on the same page. So notwithstanding different reports that will come out, it\u2019s wonderful to live in this world and get a chance to see and visit with the franchisees, not only in the U.S. but around the world.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller - Piper Jaffray","I was hoping you could help us close the gap, or get more color around, your pricing. I understand the comment about limiting pricing power, but you do have a very sophisticated process. So maybe compare and contrast what that process has told you to do historically versus what it\u2019s telling you to do today. And maybe, if it makes sense, could you tell us how it impacted taking the dollar menu to a dollar more?","And then sorry for this part, but if you have it could we get the gap in September of U.S. comp versus QSR?","Peter Bensen ","I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the pricing. So, traditionally, we strive to keep our price increases in line with food away from home. And for the year, food away from home is projected to be up 2% to 3%. And where we sit today, we\u2019re at about a 2.6% increase. So we\u2019re kind of in line with that measure as we look at it.","The other dynamic that we have to keep in mind is what\u2019s going on with food prices at the grocery store. And so the food at home price increases are actually growing about 100 basis points less. So through August, I think was the last data I saw, food at home was only up 1%. So that does create a value perception with the consumer that we do have to keep an eye on.","So those are the two biggest factors that we look at as we\u2019re looking at our pricing, as well as using our model that actually goes back in time and looks at a history of all of the price increases by individual item, by restaurant, and look at what happened to demand at those various price changes to make sure we\u2019re optimizing the menu price changes that we do choose to make.","So that\u2019s how we continue to look at that. And for the month of September, which is really the four weeks ended the 29th, our gap was actually positive 10 basis points to the QSR sandwich. On a year to date basis, that gap is 0.7.","Don Thompson ","Relative to dollar menu products, I want to make sure everyone understands, the dollar menu, there will still be a dollar menu. What we\u2019ve changed is \u201cand more\u201d which means we\u2019re adding products that are $2 level and there will be some $5 level products, and there may be some other fill ins. So I want to make sure no one thinks that we\u2019re abandoning the dollar menu. That is not something that will be part of our affordability strategy, particularly not at a time like this.","And so this is one of the ways that we can maintain the dollar menu in the face of rising commodities and labor pressures, but also get a little bit more margin basis on some of the products at $2 and some of the products at higher price points from there, and the franchisees support this.","I think when you listen to Pete, and he talked about the comp sales gaps in the QSR sandwich industry, clearly we at McDonald\u2019s are still in a very viable and strong position. The challenge for us is still there is softness in the QSR industry. And we have the right things in place, I believe, for the long term to continue to drive shareholder value.","Kathy Martin ","Okay, we have four more folks that we\u2019re going to try to get to, because we\u2019re running out of time. Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo?","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo ","Just did some quick math there on Nicole\u2019s question. It looks like 70 basis points of sequential improvement in share, September versus August. So I guess the question is, what do you attribute that improved share from month to month to?","Peter Bensen ","To clarify, our gap between us and the QSR sandwich competition year to date September is 70 basis points. For the month of September, it was only 10 basis points.","Don Thompson ","And those are our sales gaps. And what we attribute it to is the fact that we did have successful promotions relative to what we\u2019ve done with Mighty Wings. We\u2019ve had some good products with wraps. Those things we have. The challenge, again, that we have is in an industry and an IEO industry that\u2019s been contracting a bit, and also as spending has kind of split, we call it a bifurcation of spending, what we\u2019ve seen is we\u2019ve seen those customers that, to the moderate, middle to low ends, are a little bit more stressed from a discretionary spending perspective. And so that part\u2019s a bit of a wait. At the same time, as you can see from those comp sales gaps, we still have offers that are appealing to consumers.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is R.J. Hottovy with Morningstar.","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar","Appreciate the color on the fourth quarter margins, and your expectations that restaurant margin pressures will be similar to the first quarter, but I expect that the magnitude of the different line items will be different. Could you elaborate on where the different variations from the first quarter might be on the different food, labor, and occupancy line items? Any color here would be appreciated.","Peter Bensen ","At this point, we\u2019re not going to get into that level of detail on our outlook. We really were just trying, in this environment where the general expectation was that we would improve as these comparisons ease, we wanted to give some directional perspective on where we thought the numbers would settle out. Obviously in January we\u2019ll get into a lot of the details on what drove the actual.","The one item I will mention, though, as we move throughout the year, the commodity cost pressure actually is a little bit greater in the fourth quarter relative to the first quarter, and that\u2019s just really more a factor of specifically some of the proteins that were a little more benign earlier in the year, and us having hedges in place, which actually protect our grain costs throughout the year and really don\u2019t allow us to participate in sharp declines when they do happen, yet over time provide us with that predictability and stability.","Kathy Martin ","Next question is from Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies ","It looks like, even with maybe some pushback on the new unit opening front, it\u2019s still going to be a heavy fourth quarter opening schedule versus last year. I know oftentimes it\u2019s back end weighted, but is that factoring into some of the margin discussion as well?","Peter Bensen ","No, it actually isn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t looked market by market, but the fourth quarter new restaurant openings aren\u2019t dramatically different than we see traditionally year after year. And in fact the new store drag, if you will, the new store impact on margins in China and APMEA has actually sequentially gotten a little bit better. So there\u2019s nothing in those opening numbers that is adding to the pressure in the fourth quarter.","Kathy Martin ","And we\u2019re going to take our last question from Mitch Speiser with Buckingham Research. And for those of you who we didn\u2019t get to, please feel free to call IR.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research ","Just one final question on the margin outlook. And I know it\u2019s a global margin outlook. In particular, just in the U.S. you did take some incremental pricing. You did give us some pieces of the cost outlook, but I was just wondering if the weaker margin outlook is due to maybe the chicken wing costs, or just a little bit of increased discounting versus prior quarters, if those are issues in the overall margin outlook as it relates to the U.S.","Peter Bensen ","They\u2019re not really. As I said, in the U.S. the commodities, the chicken, the beef, and actually our new bacon are the three biggest impacts on commodity costs vis-\u00e0-vis the first quarter, partially offset by some of the lower grain costs. So it\u2019s really, as I mentioned in one of the earlier answers, the biggest changed from where we are in the third quarter is really being driven by Europe in terms of the global margin, and that was due to some of the more unusual or one-time kind of items that led to the increase in their third quarter margin.","Kathy Martin ","Okay, we\u2019re out of time, so I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don with the final closing talk.","Don Thompson ","Everyone, once again thanks for joining us this morning. As we wrap up the call today, I just want to reiterate our commitment to balancing thoughtful and strategic decisions for the long term with informed and decisive actions that we must take within our markets to continue to actively adjust the plans to strengthen our connection with customers, and also to position ourselves to grow the business profitably. We\u2019ve balanced both of those things together.","I\u2019m confident in our ability to deliver long term growth for the system and for our shareholders as we continue to optimize our menu, as we look for additional ways to strengthen and modernize the customer experience, and as we broaden accessibility around the world within the framework of our plan to win. Thanks again, and have a great day."],"13878":["McDonald's Corp. (NYSE:MCD) Q1 2017 Earnings Call April 25, 2017 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Stephen J.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Now before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We delivered a strong first quarter, with global comparable sales of 4%, marking our seventh consecutive quarter of positive global comparable sales. Globally, guest counts were up 0.6%, as customers visited McDonald's more in the first quarter of 2017 from the same period of 2016. And our bottom line performance was also strong. Diluted earnings per share increased 19% for the quarter in constant currencies.","At our Investor Day, we talked about how we fortified our foundation and how we're now fit for purpose. Today, we're running better restaurants. We're keenly focused on operations excellence and on the fundamentals of quality, service, cleanliness and value. And it's making a difference for customers.","Our greatest opportunities are at the core of our business. And we're continuing to gain momentum as we build a better McDonald's, one that delights customers with the taste and quality of our food, offers the highest level of convenience and provides great value. And as we shift from revitalizing the business to strengthening and growing it, we're going to talk about the moves we are making within the context of our Velocity Growth Plan. This will enable us to provide more texture on how the long-term plans we shared during our Investor Day in March are driving everything we're doing.","So let's start by going deeper on our performance. And as we do that, we're going to change things up a little. Our leadership team has a great rapport and I'm especially grateful for the partnership of our Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. And with that said, I thought the two of us ought to partner on this call like we do on a daily basis.","So I'm now going to toss it over to him.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. 2017 is off to a good start. We built upon strong prior-year results that benefited from the launch of All Day Breakfast in the U.S. and leap day, which created a 1% hurdle for this year's comparable sale across all segments.","Our top line performance is also starting to reflect the emphasis that we're placing on growing guest counts, which continues to be our top priority. During the quarter, we saw varying degrees of success, with strong sales in guest count contributions from Japan, the UK, and Canada. Guest traffic is beginning to strengthen in other markets such as the U.S. and Germany, though their guest counts remained negative for the quarter.","So before Steve walks through the steps we're taking to continue building momentum, let's take a look at first quarter sales highlights in each of our segments, starting in the U.S. We're in a stronger position in the U.S. today, a cumulative impact of the moves we've made the past couple of years. Comparable sales grew 1.7% for the quarter, fueled by ongoing customer enthusiasm for All Day Breakfast, the Big Mac promotion featuring the Grand Mac and Mac Jr, and our beverage value offerings. We also delivered a positive comp gap of 2.1% versus QSR sandwich competitors.","In the International Lead segment, comparable sales increased 2.8% for the quarter, driven primarily by continued momentum in the UK and Canada's successful launch of All Day Breakfast. In the High Growth segment, comparable sales grew 3.8%, with positive results across all markets for the second consecutive quarter. China's continued momentum was the strongest driver of segment performance.","And the Foundational Markets grew comparable sales 10.7% for the quarter, with solid results across the entire segment. Japan was the biggest contributor, with double-digit comparable sales on top of double-digit performance in the first quarter of 2016.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","So thanks for that, Kevin. Those are the drivers of the of the top line momentum in the quarter. I'd now like to turn to our strategy and the actions we're taking to sustain that momentum for the long-term, which we shared at our March Investor Day. Our Velocity Growth Plan is designed to grow guest counts by retaining customers who visit us today, regaining lapsed customers, and converting casual customers to committed customers, giving each of them more reasons to visit McDonald's more often. At the same time, we're creating the best experience for customers, leveraging our size and scale.","We're prioritizing three velocity accelerators designed to drive growth on top of everything else we're doing, and those three are digital, delivery and Experience of the Future, or as we call it EOTF. Taken together, these actions enable us to bring the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time.","So, today, I want to talk about the steps we're taking to regain customers by focusing on food quality, convenience and value. First, food quality; we know consumers place high value on taste. Serving delicious food is imperative. And as good taste and quality are so closely interrelated, we also continue to build on the moves we've made with cage-free eggs and sustainable beef to improve the quality of our food. Last month, we announced that we will serve fresh quarter pound beef patties prepared when ordered in U.S. restaurants by mid-2018. I had the chance to taste the burgers and talk with customers and franchisees in Dallas and Kevin did the same in Tulsa, and we both left convinced that customers will appreciate the improvement as we bring fresh beef around the U.S.","As we expand our menu to offer premium burgers in markets around the world, we're tapping into our restaurant operations expertise to serve customers quickly and efficiently. We've recently launched Gourmet Creations in Australia, and we'll launch the Signature Crafted platform in U.S. restaurants next week. We're taking significant steps forward on what matters most to customers, and I'm confident it will make a difference for our business and our brands.","Second, convenience; convenience is about making our customers' lives easier by providing a more accessible and personalized experience with a welcoming crew in a modern and inviting environment. In Canada, customers have come to rely on the hospitality provided by our Guest Experience Leaders, who welcome them in the restaurants and offer to guide them through the kiosk ordering process. Customers appreciate ordering at their own pace and customizing their order just the way they like it. And since their introduction in Canada, kiosk usage has more than doubled year-on-year.","In the UK, we're providing greater convenience with increased access to McDonald's. More than 650 restaurants are now open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, which is such a huge benefit to consumers managing shifting work patterns and lives that are getting increasingly hectic and complex. We continue to highlight our extensive hours through the We Are Awake Overnight campaign, showing customers we're available on their schedule.","Our leaner operating structure has improved our ability to spread our best ideas from one market to another. In markets around the world, we continue to see a collective lift from all the actions we are taking to make McDonald's more accessible and easier for customers to visit.","Third, value; when value is customer-focused and locally-relevant, it drives guest counts, period. We're committed to providing great value, whether customers have a couple of bucks in their pockets or a few more than that. In the U.S., the predictability of our national beverage value program with $1 any size coffee was well received by customers.","In Russia, we have seen increased traffic with our recently-launched all for 50 rubles value platform, which is a great value and highly competitive in that marketplace. And in Germany, our Taste of McDonald's campaign provides an everyday affordable mid-tier sandwich that is resonating with price-conscious consumers. We continue to tap into our unmatched scale and unparalleled operations to ensure customers feel good about what they get for what they pay.","As I mentioned earlier, we're not stopping there. The world in which we and our customers live demands new approaches and an evolved mindset. Our three velocity accelerators, digital, delivery and EOTF, will drive incremental, profitable growth. They create more satisfying and lasting relationships with customers, transforms convenience, expands our dayparts and collectively help us become a better McDonald's.","On digital, we are reshaping our interaction with customers, whether they eat in, take out or drive through. We'll bring mobile order and pay to 20,000 restaurants around the world by the end of this year. In the U.S. alone, mobile order and pay will be in 14,000 restaurants by the end of the year. Whilst we're still in the early days in our pilot markets, we're moving aggressively, with multiple mobile order and pay tests already underway. We're already in 400-plus restaurants across the U.S., including Chicago, Monterey, Salinas, Spokane and Washington D.C. And globally, deployment is underway in markets including the UK, Australia and China.","Through delivery, we'll bring the McDonald's experience to more customers, whether it's in their homes, their dorm rooms, to their workplace and beyond. We're encouraged by our pilot results in Florida and are expanding to additional cities in the U.S. this quarter. At the same time, we're accelerating Experience of the Future in the U.S., building on our learnings from markets around the world. As we mentioned in March, EOTF will be in roughly 2,500 U.S. restaurants by the end of 2017, with a goal of converting most of the traditional restaurants in the U.S. system by 2020. Markets like the UK and Canada have reached a critical mass with Experience of the Future and are seeing growth in both guest counts and average check size, meaning sales lifts in the mid-single digits.","And now, Kevin will share how our global growth plans are fueling the financial performance we've outlined for 2017.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","I talked about the strength of our top line results earlier. As Steve mentioned at the beginning of our call, our bottom line performance was also strong. Operating income grew by more than $250 million, or 16% in constant currencies. And earnings per share was up 19% in constant currencies.","Let's dive into the performance drivers for the quarter and their impact on our financials. The increase in first quarter operating income reflects broad-based strength across all segments, a testament to our ongoing strategic initiatives. Over the last two years, we've enhanced the strength and stability of our business as we've evolved to a more heavily-franchised organization, with more restaurants now in the hands of our outstanding local Owner\/Operators. This shift in our ownership structure also has reduced our capital and G&A needs going forward. And we are very focused on growing top line sales and profitable guest counts that directly support our critical revenue stream, as well as Owner\/Operator cash flows.","For first quarter, franchise revenues increased 7% in constant currencies, reflecting strong top line growth as well as the impact of expansion and re-franchising. Franchise margin dollars reached $1.8 billion for the quarter, a 7% increase in constant currencies, and contributed over 40% of the growth in consolidated operating income, led by results in the U.S. and the International Lead segment.","Looking next to our company-operated margins, as we've said before, margins are a top line game. Positive comparable sales in the first quarter were a key contributor to our global company-operated margin growth. These margin results also reflect the benefit of lower depreciation expense of roughly $42 million, primarily in China and Hong Kong. As we indicated in our year-end report, in accordance with accounting rules, these markets were classified as Held for Sale, effective December 31. Accordingly, we stopped recording depreciation beginning January 1. We expect a similar benefit at least through the second quarter.","Looking at the business drivers of our company-operated margins, we continue to glean insight from analytics to improve the effectiveness of our pricing models. Our intent is to optimize growth in guest counts, revenue and restaurant-level cash flows.","At the end of the first quarter, our U.S. menu reflected a 2% price increase, which was below food away from home inflation for the period of 2.4%. Menu price increases for our International Lead markets averaged about 1.5%. As Steve has said, we have made substantial progress resetting our foundation and right-sizing our structure. In Q1, our G&A was down by more than $55 million, 9% in constant currencies, reflecting both the impact of our restructuring and re-franchising, as well as our ongoing spend discipline. We will continue challenging our G&A spend and optimizing our valuable resources to prioritize the funding of initiatives that grow the business","The last item I want to call out for first quarter is foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted earnings per share by $0.02. At current exchange rates, we expect a negative impact of $0.02 to $0.04 in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.07 for the full year. As usual, please take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we progress through the year.","We ultimately measure our financial efficiency by our operating margin, as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of our overall performance. As we move through 2017 and beyond, the execution of our re-franchising initiative will yield significant benefits to our operating margin as we transition to a more streamlined and efficient model.","At the end of first quarter, we successfully completed the re-franchising of our Nordic markets. The regulatory processes to complete the previously-announced re-franchising transactions in Asia are proceeding, with the China, Hong Kong transaction expected to close in the second half of the year. And we recently completed a review of our ownership stake in McDonald's Japan and have made the decision to not proceed with the transaction at this time.","Given our current ownership, McDonald's Japan restaurants are already classified as franchised, so this decision does not impact our current re-franchising target or our intent to evolve to 95% franchised over the longer term. It also does not impact our long-term financial targets that we introduced last month. Most importantly, we're confident that we have the right capabilities and customer-focused plans to grow our business in Japan, and we believe the market is poised to maintain its strong momentum.","While our operating margin grew to nearly 36% for the quarter, items like the completion of the China, Hong Kong transaction and the related depreciation benefit that I mentioned earlier will create some choppiness in our operating margin over the next few quarters. So the near-term trend line for our operating margin won't be linear. Collectively, our re-franchising and G&A efforts, along with diligence in investing our capital to grow sales and income, will deliver increases to our operating margin and contribute to our goal of enhancing long-term financial value for our system and our shareholders.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. I want to build on what you shared by providing some additional context around why we've never been more sure of our ability to seize the potential that we see. My confidence stems from the success we've already achieved and the world-class management team we now have in place to build upon the success. We've talked about our intent to blend individuals with deep McDonald's experience with new executives who have valuable experience outside of McDonald's and bring fresh perspectives and innovative thinking.","With that in mind, we have recently brought on Bob Rupczynski as Global VP of Customer Relationship Management. Bob joins us from Mondel\u0113z International, where he was head of global media and digital. He previously led data-driven marketing strategies at Kraft.","Linda VanGosen as head of U.S. Menu; most recently Linda was at Starbucks, where she was responsible for the overall vision and strategic growth plans for Starbucks Evenings. And Morgan Flatley as U.S. Chief Marketing Officer; she comes to us from PepsiCo, where she was CMO of Global Nutrition and previously returned Gatorade to growth as CMO of that brand. We're continuing to see great talent step into important roles. And I know that, together, we'll be successful in accelerating the growth of the business.","The conversations I've had with franchisees, suppliers and, most importantly, customers have further bolstered my confidence. I visited with franchisees in the Middle East who have embraced the powerful potential Experience of the Future and seeing the impact it makes on the customer experience and their bottom lines. This is also an existing delivery market, so it was great to experience that first-hand. I've met with suppliers, including an Irish farmer participating in a national sustainability program. He's raising high-quality beef with a smaller carbon footprint and at a greater profit.","Our leadership team has talked with nearly 4,000 Owner\/Operators, company employees, suppliers, agency partners and bankers from around the world who have visited the space in Chicago where we announced our long-term growth strategy in March.","In fact, Chris Kempczinski and his team have taken groups in 20 of our 22 U.S. regions through the space, walking through the series of experiences we set up to bring our future to life. They will take groups in the remaining two regions through next week. The feedback from franchisees has been overwhelmingly positive, with over 90% approval for the U.S. plans.","And last, but certainly not least, as to long-time customers, recently in the Bay Area, as they tried and I tried, mobile order and pay for the first time and committed to use it time and again to order more of the delicious McDonald's food and drinks they love.","I have no doubt the moves we are making are the right ones to build a better McDonald's, one that serves more customers more often. We're keen to continue strengthening the foundation that drove our strong first quarter results and, at the same time, pick up velocity and fuel long-term growth by focusing on those actions that bring the biggest benefit to the most customers in the shortest possible time.","So thanks, everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. We will now open the call for analysts and investor questions. Now, the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. Quick question on the non-U.S. business, particularly leadership markets, some of the informal eating out trends in those markets, you mentioned Germany, had some down traffic. But how does it look in markets like the UK? Some consumer companies have talked about weakness since Brexit there. And in some of these markets, what is the outlook that you see in terms of your ability to change trajectory, like in Germany where it seems like you've had an on and off again value message? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Hi, David. That's a good question. I'll do a quick run around all five markets in the Lead markets just to give you a flavor. Certainly, from what we've seen in the UK, our business has not missed a beat since Brexit. Now, that's not to say that as the process works its way through over a couple of years, that may translate to a consumer confidence, but certainly for now, we have not seen the business miss a beat. And, frankly, whilst others are slightly more hesitant, our Owner\/Operators in the company are investing very aggressively in Experience of the Future and getting extremely strong performance, I've got to say, so feel really good about where the UK is at.","France, very different situation; the macroeconomic situation there has been challenging for a while. We've struggled to get like-for-like sales growth. What I would say is green shoots of encouragement and credit to the team there. They have grown guest count in the last couple of quarters. So they're in a bit of a market share fight. The consumer is nervous, given some unfortunate and terrible terrorist activity, and now we're going through the presidential elections there. So there's a little bit of uncertainty there, but we're fighting hard to stand still at the moment, but I feel really good about where the business is at as the tailwinds return.","Australia is a market where we've been very aggressive the last two or three years, with great results. The competition has woken up a little bit, so they're competing a little more, competing a little harder in the near term, so we're having just to adjust a little to that. But we're still getting solid growth. First of all, the alignment between a very aggressive positive-minded Owner\/Operator group and a strong leadership team puts us in good place, but also we've invested really well in our restaurant estate and some of the modern elements of Experience of the Future. So, again, we're in good shape to go, but we're into a little bit more street fighting than we have been over the previous couple of years.","Canada, their momentum just continues. They're doing a great job up there. And, again, very steady consistent planning year-in, year-out, is driving both strong guest count and strong sales growth. They are further down the Experience the Future rollout. So a little like Australia, Canada and the UK, we've got so many valuable learnings from how we built the growth plans there that we can bring back to the U.S. So the U.S. is very beneficial and is very open to that.","And finally, Germany; Germany has always been a real tricky market. I mean, it exports things of high value, but the consumer in Germany is very value-oriented. And you see that across the grocery sector, as well as the broader informal eating out sector. So that whenever you come off value, you feel it immediately. So we've got a much more solid platform that is being developed for every day value, which I know the team are feeling a lot more confident about. We had a slow start to the year, in all honestly, in January. February, March, certainly got stronger. And we feel a lot better entering quarter two there in Germany. We're in good shape. So it's a good question.","That sector is about 40% of our income, and the dollars we earn there are just as valuable as the dollars we earn in the U.S., which is a similar type number. I like to think of them as being our engine room and as well as an innovation hub for us as well. So I'm feeling good about the lead markets, and we're in good shape.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I just have two bookkeeping questions and then a question. So the D&A, you said that it was going to continue at this level for Q2. Is that going to be also sort of for the full year? Should we look at this as a proxy?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Matt, that depreciation benefit keeps occurring until the transaction closes, until that China, Hong Kong transaction closes. So we don't know exactly when it'll close. That's why we say at least through the second quarter. Depending on when it closes, you know, you may see some or all of that benefit in the third quarter also, depending on the actual close date of the China, Hong Kong transaction.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Understood. Okay. And then the gap you said within the U.S. with your QSR peers, that was 2.1%. I'm assuming you are outpacing the peers by 2.1%? Or are you lagging the peers by 2.1%?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","No, we're outpacing the peers by 2.1%. Thanks for clarifying. Sorry if that wasn't clear. Yes, we definitely outpaced in the first quarter the QSR sandwich peers by 2.1%.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Matt. Next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Thanks for the question. With the Experience of the Future, you've talked about the mid-single-digit comp lifts based on the markets that you've already implemented this in. And as the store transforms and you install the kiosk, I guess the question is how quickly do these benefits materialize on the sales side? And when you do look at Canada, you actually mention that kiosk usage doubled year-over-year in the Canadian market. Is that like the dynamic at play here with the EOTF that drives the most incrementality? Is it mostly within the kiosk usage? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Hey, Brian, that's a fantastic question. And I'm trying to do a better job of painting the picture of why we feel so confident and excited about Experience of the Future. And I'll give you a comparison. If we have a new menu item launch or something like an All Day Breakfast, our history will tell us that you end up with a good surge initially the first handful of months, and then it settles down to a steady run rate. And we've seen that with All Day Breakfast and we're happy. With the three accelerators that we've identified, delivery, the digital and the technology side, and Experience of the Future, these start well, but have year upon year upon year upon growth.","And let me give you an example. If we take kiosks \u2013 and that's why I really wanted to call it out in the comments earlier \u2013 first of all, it takes time for consumers' behaviors to change. So we need to get our hospitality programs very well established in a restaurant and customers have got to see a benefit. So initially, is it easier to order? Can it be easier to pay? Can you move away from the stress of the front counter?","But now think one year's time, two year's time, when we've got mobile order pay. You can go in, they can scan their favorites. We'll have a better developed CRM, customer relationship management program with some form of loyalty and reward that comes with that. You'll be able to call up your personal profile on the kiosk. You can redeem points or redeem offers, for example. So to me, the basic functionality already helps customers. They appreciate it. It's a much more modern and less stressful experience. But actually, there is incremental improvement year upon year upon year.","And, again, the best reference we have for this is what we've already got out there in the system. Self-order kiosks, for example, have been in the French market. I remember going there when I was back in the UK seven or eight years ago. They're now seeing way over half of the in-restaurant transactions go through the self-order kiosk. And at peak hours, it's almost all the transactions because people move away from the hustle-bustle front counter. So I think your point is very, very appropriate. And as we build out, this is why all these things are so important collectively.","So as we build out our digital platform, build out the functionality of the mobile app, introduce mobile order and pay, then that interacts with the kiosk, which then interacts with our kitchens. It's actually a pretty complex program that seem to be working through the last couple of years. But to me, out of the traps, it grows transactions. It grows average check, but actually the beauty of this is it will keep on providing a platform of growth. So thanks for the question.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. How should we be thinking about the U.S. menu and the changes and the progression as you look to refine the value messaging? You talked about the rollout of Signature Crafted, and you've also recently discussed innovation. How should we be thinking about that from a modeling standpoint and from just your implementation as you run through net simplification? Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Brett. I won't try to help you think about it from a modeling perspective. I'll leave that to you guys. But the one thing we know, we have to be competitive on value, so Chris Kempczinski and the Owner\/Operators fully embracing that. It doesn't mean you have to win on it, but be competitive certainly at the entry level. So if you've only got a buck or two in your pocket, there's something good for you at McDonald's. So that is always important.","Then we want to reinforce and support the core menu. And don't underestimate the value of the core menu to us. We've got half a dozen multi-billion dollar brands within just the core menu. And most recently, we've seen the success we can have by supporting a Big Mac, having some extensions of that to create some fun. We had some fun with the Big Mac sauce, for example, and that creates familiarity with kind of our traditional menu.","Then as we get better as a business, as the brands resonate increasingly with customers, we can explore more at the premium end and our credibility grows with that. So we feel good about Signature Crafted. This gives a variety of taste, different flavor profiles, more premium ingredients or unusual ingredients, in choosing guacamole, for example. And customers, we know, are willing to pay a premium for that at certain times.","Then you also want to think about what is the role that the local Co-op plays versus national. So, that's another dynamic in the U.S. that's different to any other market around the world. So, we may want to compete with more local flavors and tastes in certain areas of the country. The Southwest will have a different flavor profile for promotional items than the Pacific Northwest, for example, or the Northeast. So that gives you a little bit of opportunity to create variety and just stay interesting to customers at a more local level. So, to me, this is all about balance. Yes, we want to have a strong value program. Yes, we want to play strong in the premium ends, but also our heartland is where us and our Owner\/Operators earn most of their cash flow.","So I'm feeling good that we will have menu innovation, but it won't be reckless. We cannot have too many items too often because that gets to your final point, which is simplification. And one of the things I have really enjoyed \u2013 well, hopefully, it's contributing to, but just witnessing across the U.S. team is they're getting increasingly confident about making fewer, bigger decisions. And that really helps the restaurant managers run restaurants better because there is less complexity. So all these dynamics play with each other, but menu, clearly, fundamentally, is a big part of our future.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, wonder if you can talk about the shift within your U.S. comp of traffic and average ticket over the past couple of quarters. I know you pushed $1 coffee and then the Mac Jr seemed to resonate pretty well among the guests here in the U.S. So I'm curious if you saw that transaction ever pick up quite a bit and if you feel that is something that's sustainable throughout the year?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I'll kick off and then maybe Kevin wants to talk about the pricing piece versus food away from home. I mean the one thing there's been really part of the honest conversations we have around the business, and you would have probably seen that at the Investor Day, was let's acknowledge the level of guest counts or transactions that we've lost because, frankly, we want those back. And an element of that is on the value side, but also an element of that is on the broader experience. We just make ourselves more inviting.","So I would say we have fought harder on the value side the last three to four months. And I know the U.S. team and our Owner\/Operators are embracing some aggressive value programs going forward, as well. And that has helped to narrow the gap between sales and guest counts. We didn't quite squeeze a positive guest count in the U.S. in the quarter. That said, we were up against a 1% hurdle, but, frankly, ultimately, our measure of success is full percentage points of guest count growth. So I'm not really worried about the tenths here and the tenths there, because that will underpin the long-term sustaining growth. So we have a very honest appreciation of what it is that we're looking to achieve here. And competing on value and broadening and enhancing our experience, we know will drive customer behavior.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, the only thing I'd add is, certainly, our intent is to grow both traffic and check. What you would have seen in the first quarter is average check grew partly from price, as I mentioned. We grew price less than food away from home, which is our long-term goal to make sure that we're kind of in that range in order to help drive guest counts. But the other benefit we also had in the first quarter was from a mix perspective. Certainly, things like the Big Mac promotion drove a better product mix than the year before, which helped drive that average check also. Thanks.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Steve, you mentioned that the franchisees are making the rounds through Chicago to take the Experience of the Future tour after we did in early March. And that the overall feedback is very positive, with a 90% approval around the plan. Just curious, though, for the franchisees who need further convincing, what reasons are they citing besides the cost of the program?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, it's a good question, Andrew, because this gets to the core dynamics of what makes us different and we believe differentiates us in a positive way. Our Owner\/Operator, remember, these are 20 year commitments. So the vast majority of Owner\/Operators all have a long-term perspective. And that gives them the confidence and the encouragement to reinvest two to three times around that cycle to keep their business contemporary and in line.","So I guess clearly and totally understandably, whenever you build bold confident plans that require some investment, that comes with an element of nervousness. I get that. And we all do. So, therefore, we try and demonstrate that we have the business case to support it. And also given we've got company-owned restaurants, we have skin in the game and we see that as well.","I guess, to give you an example, there may be someone who is at year 16 or 17 of their term who will be wondering if they put that money in now, will they see that back in the remaining years or will they get that back if they're to sell all their restaurants. So each and every individual has a slightly different perspective on it, but I would say as an overall basis, significant enthusiasm. They love the idea of the U.S. going together on this, because the one thing that makes us powerful is whilst we respect and really cultivate the local Owner\/Operator in their local markets and communities, and that resonates strongly, we know the brand McDonald's is strongest when 14,000 restaurants go together. And I think the confidence and the boldness of the plans that are being drawn up \u2013 yes, a little bit of nervousness, but that's just a normal human reaction. I think the excitement exceeds the nervousness by quite some way. So we feel we're at a really interesting and fun place at the moment.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. The question centers around the U.S. comps and one particular driver, but just on the comp in general, it seems like a lot of investors use the two and three year trends as a gauge to try and forecast. And I know there's a lot of concern going into the fourth quarter and first quarter of lapping the All Day Breakfast. But with the compares now easing, seemingly meaningfully, in coming quarters, just wondering is it not reasonable to assume a nice acceleration in the U.S. comp from that 1.7% level in the first quarter? Is there something we're missing, maybe to temper that enthusiasm just to try and kind of manage expectations as those compares ease?","And separately, I'm just wondering if you can give any color on the delivery as an aside. I know you gave a lot of color on the mobile order and pay with digital and the Experience of the Future, but I don't think we have much in the way of the timing of the ramp of delivery and the potential contribution on that front. Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Jeff. In all honesty, I'm not going to give any forward-looking reassurance. That's not the way we tend to do things. I don't want to break that now. What we have tried to do is give you visibility into our plans. And that's what March 1 was all about, to demonstrate to you why we are confident in the long-term growth of the business. So we're doing a good job on the fundamentals.","Let me give you another piece of texture around the U.S. and what I believe is helping to underpin some of our performance. Along with building exciting plans becomes a greater accountability for all of us who run restaurants, whether it's Owner\/Operators or the company. We have been much more mindful. The U.S. team has been much more mindful about addressing the bottom quartile of performance, of operational performance. We're helping support, encourage and expect them to improve performance, but that has meant that some have left the system and those restaurants have moved into the hands of better Owner\/Operators.","So as you can imagine, that then helps underpin just core baseline momentum as well. So I just wanted to get that piece in there about accountability, day-to-day running great restaurants. And whilst we have great relationships, we're not scared of the honest conversations either. So that's important to stress.","With delivery, we are in an interesting stage. As you know, we featured it at the Investor Day, so that was very mindfully done because it's one of our accelerators. We've had 200-plus restaurants in Florida now for a while, and we're encouraged about the start we've had. I would say similar to the Experience of the Future, it will start slightly lower and grow over time as we get better at it, as awareness grows and we put more marketing muscle behind it and customers begin to respond and change their behaviors.","But that said, also, it would be fair to say we are not in test mode. We're expanding. And we're going to be expanding to a number of U.S. cities this quarter. But we're learning as we go. We're learning on delivery radius, on the in-store dynamic, on how we can capture the order better and prepare an order fresher, et cetera. So we are continuously learning. But, yes, we feel good about the way we're interacting with UberEATS. They've proven to be a good partner for us and, hopefully, we are for them. So we'll be expanding into a number of U.S. cities with UberEATS this quarter and demonstrating why we believe this is a velocity accelerator.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just one quick clarification on the U.S. traffic, I know you mentioned it was negative, but I was wondering if it was negative if you adjust for that leap day drag. And then, my real question is on the initiative to roll out fresh beef in the Quarter Pounder in the U.S. And I understand the consumer proposition, but can you talk a bit about the operational complexity or risk that that might add from a service speed, or however you think about executing that initiative? And then secondly, do you think this is a precursor for rolling out fresh proteins across the menu longer-term?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, I'll take the quick U.S. guest count clarification, and then Steve can talk about the fresh beef. As we mentioned, the U.S. was negative in the first quarter. To your point, if you adjust for the leap day effect from last year, it'd be relatively flat.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","And then on fresh beef, David, so we'd been in the market, particularly in Dallas, for a little over a year before we made the decision. We made the decision maybe three, maybe four weeks ago to say yes and to go with this. So we entered this with a very, I would say, a very open mind. We were excited about the opportunities from a customer perspective, but mindful of the complexity, cost, operational impacts, et cetera. So I would say we've been very well supported by the Owner\/Operator groups, in particularly Tulsa and Dallas. We have worked through a lot of the kinks in this, so we believe this is very little incremental from a cost perspective.","We did initially, in the early restaurants, see service slow down a little in the drive-thru, but we have found ways to get around some of those operational complications and brought that right back down to a negligible impact. There's a different food handling required, clearly, when you're dealing with fresh product than with frozen, but, again, with help from our suppliers, we've made the packaging very simple, the storage very simple, the food handling very simple.","So there was an overriding call \u2013 I was getting letters from the Owner\/Operators pleading for us to go with this. They believe they've overcome any in-restaurant issues that them and their teams had, but they were getting such an encouraging response from customers, because it tastes juicier. It's just hotter and juicier. It's a great-tasting product.","So we feel good that we have vested that time, that one year, well to overcome any of the potential \u2013 and I think this is a good indication of the change of mindset that we have around McDonald's. There's plenty of yes-but conversations about how you could've, nice idea-buts. But we've gone to yes-and. How can we overcome it? And how can we make a difference?","As to whether this signals a future, absolutely no idea. At the moment, we feel good about where we're at with Quarter Pounder. Given the volumes of Quarter Pounders we handle and the fact that that is our biggest patty, therefore, the biggest benefit transfers to the customer because that's where the juiciness and the heat really comes from. We feel good about that. We're going to roll the Quarter Pounder out over the next year or so, and we just look forward to seeing the results.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the food away from home and pricing topic, which is to say, historically, I think when we've seen inflation, McDonald's has actually done better at this, about widening this gap. And I guess I'm trying to anticipate if we look forward and we do see a bit more inflation, could you anticipate having maybe even, relative to the market, maybe again a little bit wider gap than even what you've already seen this quarter, in a good way? And have you thought a little bit about, you know, what the implications might be for traffic versus margin with respect to your franchisees' businesses? So that's my first question. And then, just quick follow-up, could you give the comp for China, please? Thank you.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","All right. Let me start with the pricing. As you mentioned, there are several things we keep an eye on as we think and look at pricing. Food away from home is one of the metrics we look at over the longer term to generally try and be below that metric. But as you know, we also look at food at home. And most recently, there's been a pretty big gap between food at home, food away from home. I think that gap is starting to narrow a little bit from the highs that we saw in 2016. But our philosophy on pricing really is to make sure that we're focused on pricing that will help drive traffic, as well as margins and Operator cash flow. So, you know, the Operators certainly are concerned about increasing profitability, as are we, but we also want to make sure that we're not taking too much pricing that discourages guests from coming in.","We have a lot of models that look at the dynamics of this pricing, both within our menu and against competitors, and I think we're getting better with our analytics at looking at some of those metrics. But historically, as you mentioned, I think we have done fairly well with what I'll call some reasonable inflation, whether that's 1% to 2%. We've certainly shown an ability to adjust our cost base to address inflationary pressures. But I feel pretty good about where we are right now from the pricing standpoint. We were a little bit ahead last year of food away from home, and I think now we have adjusted appropriately.","Regarding China, you know, I guess what I would say is while we're in the midst of this pending transaction with our strategic partners, I think out of respect to them and the process, we won't talk about a specific number. What I would say is our comparable sales were clearly higher than our near-in competitor in China, and I'll leave it at that.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Steve, my question has to do with just complexity around Experience of the Future as we walk through all the different elements of it. It seemed like this is a great consumer proposition, but it's a significantly more complex operation for the employees, meaning they've got to do delivery out to the curb, they've got to take orders from multiple points. What has been your experience early on in rolling that out? Do you have to add additional labor to the restaurants in order to \u2013 or training to the restaurants to get people over that hump of, sort of dealing with these different aspects? And do you have to think about who you recruit and how you recruit employees? It's a tight labor market, but maybe you need a different employee to interact with the consumer, given all the complexities.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Okay. Great question, actually, John. So scripting down to two or three different areas, I think you've kind of hit the areas that are important. So, yes, as we deploy Experience of the Future, there's a comprehensive training program that goes with that. And that's one of the things I think we're typically pretty good at. When we get into rollout mode, with the talent we have in the field, the operations experience, we do roll out these programs pretty well. But, yes, there's absolutely a training element to this.","Additional labor, no, we're not seeing additional labor. What we are seeing is a reallocating of labor positions in the restaurants, and we need less people behind the front counter taking orders. And, you know, part of the significant benefit, both for us and for the customer on this, is we can repurpose them into the dining area.","Now, that doesn't necessarily mean the same people can do both roles. So what we're also seeing \u2013 and we've learned a whole heap from Canada, in particular, Australia, UK more recently \u2013 is there is a new role in McDonald's, and that's kind of the hospitality service person. So we have a dedicated job description for that. We hire specifically for that. Because it does require a different skill set. Those social interactions are different. And clearly, they will end up being busier, not just helping customers in and around the kiosk, but actually as we roll out table service as well. They will actually be delivering to food to customers' tables as well, so not additional labor, but repurposed. Is there training on rollout? Absolutely, yes, because that gives us the best shot of landing this well and making it smooth.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I heard your response to Jeff's earlier question, and I recognized that mobile order and pay has been in test for only something like five to six weeks, but what is the plan for sharing performance updates on these test markets in coming quarters, meaning when this is a little bit more on its feet? At least from my perspective, I do think investors are very focused on this, and I'm curious how much information you guys will provide as we move through 2017.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Actually, that's a fair question, Jeff. At the moment, we haven't thought about sharing. This is early stages, but it is an accelerator for us, and we will want to give you some visibility, both in terms, say, the number of restaurants and the types of customer behaviors. Whether we give a precise number each and every time, I doubt that's where we'd head, but we want to give you an indication of whether this is enough to get excited about, but, you know, we have identified three accelerators. We do see them as changing the momentum of our business.","So these aren't fringe things. These are platforms that we believe will grow and then grow year-on-year. So I think you will be getting more disclosure as we build up some critical mass, and we can start to help you interpret the numbers better and project forward.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Matt McGinley with Evercore.","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, thank you. I have a question. At the March Investor Day, you outlined a plan in the U.S. to regain, retain, and convert customers, and that was built around quality, value, and convenience message that I think you already discussed on this call, but as you look at that inflection in the trend that you have, and I know it may not be very easy to quantify, I'm curious who you think you're actually bringing back, or who you've brought back this year in this inflection trend you've seen in the past few months, or even few quarters.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","If we're just talking about the U.S. specific, and I'm guessing that may be where the question is...","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Yes. Yes, U.S.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I think the regain is really largely around value. I mean, we saw that we were losing customers in the value end of our menu for a period of time. Retaining our stronghold is something that clearly we'll do through core menu and ongoing value, and experience, and convenience. We certainly saw some seepage of guest counts, if you like, at the value end.","And I think the more competitive position we've taken, and our Owner\/Operators have taken and embraced, has helped us recover some of that as well. Early days, very difficult to diagnose precisely, but as we saw the market share gains that Kevin outlined, and the 2.1% outperformance of our QSR peers, we know the combination of core menu, Big Mac extensions, $1 coffee, and then, as we exited the quarter, begun to move to $1 any size drinks. We know that combination resonated well.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","We have time for one more question, and that will be John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was just hoping we could get just a view of the current labor market in the United States as it stands. Obviously, we're seven-plus years into an economic recovery. And this far in, sometimes the restaurant industry begins to see stress in terms of quality and availability and cost of employees, especially as turnover goes up. So how is the system kind of faring with that? Are there any plans, specifically in 2017 and 2018, for you to become even more of an employer of choice for this type of worker than you've been in the past, and just how are you feeling about things overall?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, John, it's a really astute point. I would say compared to three, four, five years ago, the general labor market is tightening a little bit, and, clearly, that is something we are mindful of. It hasn't really taken us by surprise, because we've seen economic cycles before. We know what that means to us.","What you may have seen, for example, and part of our response to this, as well as we modernize our restaurants, as we introduce technology, we've become a more appealing place for people to work. And we believe that people in the service sector are more tempted to a modern McDonald's today than perhaps they would have done to a type of McDonald's of yesterday, but the other piece you may have seen is we've worked hard above the line on employer reputation, on jobs, on training, on skills, on education.","So we talk about here in the U.S., in particular, being America's best first job. And that's something that we believe we can substantiate through opportunity, flexibility, pay and rewards, but also under the archways for opportunity programs you would have heard us talk about where we can help with high school diplomas and get our people into further education, where not only are we a job and not only do we help them pay the bills, but actually we help them progress in life and go to the next stage and build careers, either within or beyond McDonald's.","So I think you're going to see the labor market further tighten. That's an expectation we certainly have. And you will also see us going increasingly hard and even if it's as recently as just this last week, when you've seen about the new uniforms we're rolling out. We're looking at every aspect of the employment proposition here, because we do see it getting tighter. And we just believe the more attractive we can make ourselves, that put us in a better chance of being a winner in this marketplace.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","All right, we're near the top of the hour. So with that, I will turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing remarks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks very much, Mike. And hopefully, we got across we believe today we're fit for purpose and that we're building a better McDonald's. The Velocity Growth Plan is guiding our focus and execution on the opportunities that will improve the experience of our customers. I am fully confident in our ability to harness our unmatched competitive advantages to satisfy customers, drive profitable growth and deliver value to our shareholders. So with that said, thanks to all of you for dialing in and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."],"13884":["McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mike Cieplak - Investor Relations Officer","Steve Easterbrook - President and CEO","Kevin Ozan - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Eric Gonzalez - KeyBanc","Andrew Charles - Cowen","Sara Senatore - Bernstein","David Palmer - RBC","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Greg Francfort - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","David Tarantino - Baird","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Operator","Hello, and welcome to McDonald's Fourth Quarter 2018 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.","Mike Cieplak","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Mike.","We're pleased with our strong performance in 2018. Global comparable sales increased 4.5% for the year reflecting our broad-based momentum across the McDonald's System. This is a year when we brought our customers greater convenience, choice and value as we continued aggressively transforming our business.","Customers rewarded us with more visits again last year, resulting in back-to-back years of global guest count growth for the first time since 2012. This achievement is even more notable at a time when it's all meeting our traffic growth has been muted. Most of our top markets excelled in 2018 and outperformed our competitors.","The U.K. for example, now has 51 consecutive quarters of like-for-like sales growth and it continue to gain share in a shrinking market. Canada grew comparable sales and guest counts for the quarter and the year, extending its 10-year round of success. With 19 consecutive quarters in comparable sales growth, Australia continued their momentum with offerings such as the successful all-day favorites and the benefit of rising delivery sales.","Germany is outperforming competitors as customers enjoy modernized restaurants and the benefits of one of the most effective digital engagement programs in the McDonald's System. The market now has seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth and posted its best annual comparable sales growth percentage in 25 years.","Italy continues to be one of our best-performing markets. The foundation of that success starts with a great leadership team executing a solid growth plan. The market's also seeing positive results from investing in Experience of the Future and maximizing the business impact of other Velocity Growth Plan initiatives such as digital and delivery. McDonald's Italy had a strong 2017 and followed that with an even better year in 2018.","In the U.S., we're in the middle of the ambitious program the market has ever undertaken. The U.S. is executing a significant number of initiatives at the same time. Still in 2018, we grew sales while continuing to invest billions of dollars in our restaurants, making foundational changes in our business and staying focused on our customers.","While we have much ahead of us, we made significant progress with a lot of hard work in 2018. The U.S. is a much more nimble organization today than it was in the start of 2018. We reduced the number of co-ops from nearly 200 to fewer than 60 and half the number of field offices.","The market trend down the number of most famous as it works with from dozens to fewer than 10. The most significant change in the market resulted in giving our customers better tasting food, greater convenience and a better overall experience. One example in the U.S. is last year's national launch of cooked right when you order fresh beef quarter-pound burgers, getting customers hotter and juicier burgers like [indiscernible].","In 2018, the U.S. converted about 4,500 restaurants to Experience of the Future. That meant we reopened more than 10 new restaurants everyday throughout the year, introducing local communities across the country to a dramatically different McDonald's.","This is an aggressive pace with an ambitious agenda at a time when the U.S. market is experiencing intense competitive pressures. Chris Kempczinski and the U.S. leadership team remain engaged in collaborative and constructive dialogue with franchisees.","At the end of 2018, they met face to face with franchisees in all 10 field offices across the country. They discussed key challenges facing the business, including the effort required to execute the plan at the current pace and the optimum balance between local and national decision-making.","Once we made some tactical and timely adjustments to our plan, collectively we remain committed to the growth strategy. It gives McDonald's the best opportunity to win in what is becoming an increasingly competitive market share fight.","I also meet regularly with franchisees throughout the U.S. and earlier this month, I had the chance to visit with several of them in Louisiana and Georgia. I heard first-hand how much they appreciate the flexibility and our continued willingness to work with them in carrying out the plan.","This is the right strategy for our business and we're committed to driving shared success. Using our modernized restaurants is easy to see how the [indiscernible] refreshed decor and overall hospitality make a difference for our customers. We established a solid foundation in the U.S. last year that will serve us well in 2019.","Now Kevin will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Steve.","With a relentless focus on our growth strategy, we continued our strong sales momentum across most of our top markets with global comp sales up 4.4% for the quarter. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of global comp sales increases with each segment once again contributing to the growth. We also grew global guest counts for the quarter.","Our top line performance and broad-based strength is a significant achievement given the muted Informal Eating Out environment in most of our major markets as Steve mentioned earlier. Looking across the segment, the international lead markets continue to outperform the competition with comp sales up 5.2% for the quarter, led by the U.K., Germany and Australia. For the full year, every market in the ILM segment delivered both sales and guest account growth, something these markets haven't achieved since 2011.","High growth segment comp sales were up 4.8% for the quarter with Italy, the Netherlands and Poland delivering double-digit comp sales growth and positive comps across most of the segment. In the foundational markets, comp sales were up 7.1% with Japan once again leading the segment and positive comps across all geographic regions.","Turning to the U.S. Comp sales were up 2.3% for the quarter while comp guest counts remain negative. In 2018, the QSR environment in the U.S. proved challenging with aggressive promotional activity throughout the industry. Despite this, we achieved a positive comp sales GAAP of 100 basis points for the full year versus our QSR sandwich competitors.","In the fourth quarter, U.S. sales continue to benefit from healthy average check increases from favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. Value and DL offerings like the four for $6 classic meal deal, limited time offers like the glazed tenders and triple breakfast stack sandwiches and our fresh beef quarter pound burgers all contributed to a higher average check.","As I discussed on last quarter's earnings call, construction downtime and slower sales recovery related to the aggressive pace of modernization in the U.S. was a headwind in 2018. We've implemented processes to shorten project downtime and accelerate recovery to minimize the impact to the business as we continue our EOTF deployment.","Turning to bottom line results. Earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, an 18% increase in constant currencies after excluding current year impairment charges and tax reform related items in both the current and prior year.","In addition to strong comp sales performance, EPS benefited from a lower than normal 19% effective tax rate for the quarter while foreign currently translation was an offsetting pressure of $0.05 per share.","Franchise margin dollars grew 6% in constant currencies for the quarter, reflecting sales driven performance in conventional refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined by 90 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset primarily by higher depreciation costs related to EOTF modernization in the U.S.","Despite cost pressures around the world like rising labor costs, sales growth and refranchising benefits drove a 20 basis point increase in consolidated company-operated margins.","2018 was the first full year we began operating under our streamlined and more heavily franchised business model and the benefits are reflected in our results. Our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In 2018, free cash flow was $4.2 billion, an increase of 14% over 2017.","Our full year restaurant margin dollars grew by over $100 million in constant currencies. And excluding current year and prior year special items, our 2018 operating margin was 43%, up over 4 percentage points from the prior year. In the U.S., company-operated margins declined 190 basis points for the quarter.","Wage pressures and continued investments in deployment of our key initiatives contributed to both higher labor cost and depreciation expense. Commodity costs were up about 2.5% for both the quarter and full year.","Menu price increases were around 2% for the quarter as we look to strategically balance the need to offset cost pressures with our customers' willingness to pay. For the International lead markets, commodity pressures eased for the quarter up 1% while the full year was up 2%. Menu prices increased about 2% year-over-year.","G&A for the year was down 2% in constant currencies. I'll put our G&A savings into perspective in a few minutes when I review our outlook for 2019.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","For the two full years into executing the Velocity Growth Plan, our strategy remains focused on [indiscernible] guest count momentum and regaining customer visits. We're visibly demonstrating to our customers how we're becoming a better McDonald's with a robust range of initiatives.","With our focus on improving the taste of our delicious food, enhancing convenience, offering compelling value, upholding the trust consumers place in our brands, we are maximizing our opportunity to improve customer perceptions and encourage more visits.","We continuously strive to improve the taste of the iconic sandwiches at the core of our menu and introducing items to even to customers. During the quarter, we have many examples in markets of how success and encouraging visits and sales with menu changes.","In Germany, customers continue to enjoy iconic favorites on the Taste of McDonald's platform such as the McChicken. Canada extended the successful launch of bagels earlier in the year by introducing All Day Breakfast Bagel Sandwiches with fresh cracked eggs.","In Spain, [indiscernible] drives the popular customers seeking a snack and many also enjoyed adding them on to a meal. Last year Canada had a successful promotion introducing bacon on some of our classic sandwiches and this week the U.S. launched a similar campaign to encourage more visits to our restaurants.","We were pleased to see the attention generated with yesterday's bacon events and the U.S. is following up by offering Bacon Big Macs and Quarter Pounders as well as cheesy bacon fries. Time and again we see the importance customers place on getting their food hot and fresh with fast, friendly service. Customers notice a difference when we run great restaurants and we continue to focus on improving the operations of our restaurants to provide customers with great all-round experience.","I'm encouraged by the greater discipline we're demonstrating in many of our markets as I simplify menus, take other actions that reduce complexity and improve our ability to provide exceptional experiences for our customers.","Serving delicious food and offering great service are vital, but not the only requirements for maintaining strong trust to consumers. Public expectations are leading companies like McDonald's have never been higher.","In December we announced that we are partnering with suppliers and beef producers to reduce the overall use of antibiotics in our beef supply chains. This is the latest in a series of announcements throughout 2018 but we detailed both targets by using our scale for good and addressing some of the world's most pressing challenges.","In committing our resources, attention and significant convenient power and influence, we are demonstrating to our customers, employees and other stakeholders that McDonald's is worthy of their trust. 2018 also marked a year of significant progress with each of our Velocity, accelerated delivery, Experience of the Future and digital.","We will take action in 2019 to capture additional growth opportunities within the Velocity strategy. Delivery momentum continues and is now available for over 19,000 restaurants, over half of our global system. It took us almost 20 years to grow our annual delivery business in the Middle East and Asia to $1 billion. Over the past two years, delivery has become a $3 billion business for both McDonald's company and franchise restaurants globally.","Delivery continues to grow rapidly as we expand through additional restaurants and third-party providers as well as benefiting from strong same-store sales momentum. Many of our major markets such as to the U.S., France and in the U.K. achieved delivery sales growth in the high double-digits in restaurants offering a service for more than 12 months and other markets such as Canada, Italy and Russia grew even more.","We\u2019re confident this delivery offers additional growth potential for our business. Even with the momentum we already have established, we know we have an opportunity to let more customers know the McDonald's will bring meals to their homes, offices and college dorm rooms.","Driving awareness begins with encouraging more customers to try delivery. We talked before about the high satisfaction among our delivery customers and their willingness to reorder and we continue to see those trends hold steady throughout 2018. We placed a high priority on identifying the winning ideas developed by individual markets and spreading them elsewhere within the McDonald's system. With delivery, U.K. Canada and Australia are leaders within McDonald's and are developing innovative approaches to help restaurants with high order volumes.","In Australia, awareness more than doubled through a major campaign of promotional delivery within-restaurant signs, engaging social media outreach, PR activity and advertising. And in its own awareness campaign, Uber Eats in Australia featuring McDonald's demonstrating the strength of our partnership.","We also continue to bring learning from China, our most developed delivery market, to help our newer delivery markets, especially related to restaurant operations. As we have said previously, underpinning everything we do with this growth accelerator is our commitment to make delivery easy and convenient for our customers, which will help us maximize the competitive advantage of our business.","Now I'll turn to another one of our Velocity accelerators, Experience of the Future. The refreshed decor, new ordering options and an enhanced focus on providing more enjoyable visits to our restaurants, we're introducing a new hospitality experience to McDonald's customers.","Our guest experience of years have been the key to a better customer experience, which we've seen drive high customer satisfaction and sales and ultimately, strong business results. With about half of our restaurants around the world converted to EOTF, we have many more customers experience modernized restaurants and enhanced hospitality.","We've identified an opportunity to be more consistent in assuring restaurants as proven best practices for engaging with customers in our updated restaurants. We've made significant progress for example in the U.S. in training tens of thousands of additional guest experience leaders to greet our guests with enthusiastic smile, assist the customer with kiosk orders, offering trays of Big Macs and fries to a customer's table.","We're encouraged by the impacts on our business as we continue to enhance hospitality and complete more projects. Restaurants that have introduced Experience of the Future elements continue to perform in line with our expectations with higher sales and customer satisfaction. Customer expectations for the way they interact with brands continue to rise. We have made additional progress in 2018 rolling out digital platforms, making the McDonald's experience simpler and more personalized for our customers.","In the years ahead, we will continue making strides through digital channels to reward customers with good value and relevant offers as well as incorporating fun experiences they appreciate from our brands.","These opportunities are possible because the extensive work we completed in deploying technology throughout the McDonald's system, including self-order kiosks in nearly 17,000 restaurants, digital menu boards in more than 21,000 restaurants and new capabilities from low bottle room pay as available in over 22,000 restaurants.","Now Kevin will discuss our outlook for 2019.","Kevin Ozan","Over the last several years, we fundamentally enhanced the strength and stability of our business. In anticipation of being substantially complete with our refranchising efforts, we established long-term average annual financial targets set to begin this year.","These targets reflect our confidence in our ability over the long term to increase system wide sales 3% to 5%, maintain our operating margin in the mid-40% range, deliver earnings per share growth in the high single-digits and achieve a return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range.","The strength and reliability of our significant and growing cash flow enables us to return about $25 billion to shareholders over the three-year period ending this year, including our 15% dividend increase announced last September.","Over the last two years, we returned over $16 billion toward this target through share repurchases and dividends. Looking into 2019, we anticipate some headwinds this year around labor cost, EOTF-related depreciation in the U.S., commodities and foreign currency translation, which will put some pressure on EPS growth this year. Higher depreciation expense in the U.S. will continue to impact both franchise and company operated margins over the next couple of years.","Franchise-related depreciation expense will increase by about $100 million year-over-year in 2019 and depreciation on company-owned restaurants will also increase about $15 million, both driven by the accelerated pace of EOTF.","We expect commodity increases in the U.S. of 1% to 2% for the year and an increase of about 2% in our key markets outside the U.S. Based on current exchange rates, we also anticipate currency pressures to continue for the first half of this year. At today's rates, we expect currency to negatively impact EPS by $0.08 to $0.10 in the first quarter and $0.13 to $0.15 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.","We continue to exercise strong financial discipline and we expect about a 4% G&A reduction in constant currencies for the year. At current exchange rates, this will result in total G&A of roughly $2.1 billion. Since the beginning of 2015, we will have achieved growth G&A savings of over $600 million. After reinvesting some of this back into areas to drive growth, like technology, we'll be down net of about $500 million from our initial 2015 budget of $2.6 billion.","We've mentioned that most of our major refranchising transactions are complete. We will continue to refranchise some restaurants to conventional licensees across markets such as the U.K. and U.S. but to a much lesser extent. As a result, we expect gains on restaurant sales this year to be about $200 million less than 2018.","Moving on to capital. We ended 2018 with capital expenditures of $2.7 billion. Although this was slightly higher than initially planned for the year, we completed about 4,500 EOTF projects in the U.S., well exceeding our original plan of 4,000 projects.","As we've also noted, inflation in the overall construction industry has also been a pressure on EOTF project costs. We currently expect to spend roughly $2.3 billion of capital in 2019. Nearly $1 billion of that capital will be dedicated to completing approximately 2,000 EOTF projects in the U.S. Our recent adjustments to the U.S. plan now provide in the ability to more evenly balance remaining EOTF projects between 2019 and 2020.","While we have provided an option for franchisees to extend the projects beyond 2020 at a reduced partnering level, most franchisees are choosing to complete their projects over the next couple of years. So we expect to be substantially complete with EOTF by the end of 2020.","New restaurant development continues to be an important component of our growth equation. We plan to open roughly 1,200 new restaurants this year. We will spend approximately $600 million of our capital to open about 300 restaurants in our wholly-owned markets.","Our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining 900 openings, nearly half of which are planned in China. This is a demonstration of how the financial resources and capabilities brought by our expanded network of developmental licensees create opportunities for accelerated expansion.","As we enter 2019, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.","Steve Easterbrook","With our strong performance in 2018, you can see why we're confident in our strategy. We have a lot of growth potential remaining in the core of the Velocity Growth Plan and the accelerators provide a solid foundation driving our business as we begin 2019.","We also recognized there are significant challenges as we enter the New Year. Kevin shared several of the financial headwinds to growth that we are and as you've seen consumer uncertainty is growing from France to China to the U.K. and elsewhere across the Globe and as well as the tightening economies and shifting political environments. Still we remain optimistic.","The investments we already made in modernizing thousands of our restaurants have placed us in a strong position. This will continue, we will continue to prioritize investments in our restaurants and our business so we can keep advancing as a leading global brand in our dynamic consumer landscape. In the fiber market share, some will succeed and others won't. We intend to keep positioning McDonald's on the winning side.","And now I hand it over to Mike, who can lead Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mike Cieplak","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.","Eric Gonzalez","I have a few questions related to your capital spending plans. Based on your '19 guidance, it seems like you're expecting then roughly the same amount in the U.S. business this year versus last year, yet you're expecting to complete roughly half the number of EOTF projects. So I guess the question is, has the EOTF project cost materially increased or there other areas of spending that you're not previously - that you haven't previously considered? And also, how should we think about capital spending plans for the out years in 2020 and 2021 given some of the projects being delayed and considering McDonald's co-investment rate will decline to 40%? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks, Eric. And yes, we're trying to stay warm but it's a little difficult these days. All right, so let me talk about capital both for 2018 and 2019. In 2018, we spent roughly $1.4 billion of our capital on EOTF projects in the U.S.","In 2019, that number will be less than $1 billion. So it's going down by, I'll call it roughly $0.5 billion, the amount that we're spending on EOTF in the U.S. The other dynamic that's occurring though is there's a little bit different mix in the types of projects that are occurring in 2019 versus 2018 on a couple of fronts. One is our company-operated restaurants.","So we did about 200 company-operated restaurants in 2018, but that was only 4% of the total projects for that year. We'll do a similar number of company-operated projects to finish those off in 2019, so about 200 again, but that will be 10% of the total projects for 2019. So that helps skew to a little bit higher average cost.","The other dynamic that's happening is in 2018, as we've talked about, some of the projects are what we call non mods these are the ones that hadn't been modernized and need the full modernization of the restaurant in addition to EOTF elements.","Those were about a third of the projects in 2018, while what we call modern or restaurants that have already been modernized were about two-thirds. Those are lower cost than the non-mods obviously.","In 2019, that split have roughly half and half. So that also brings up down that average cost from 2018. So our average cost per project is a little bit higher in 2019 than 2018 because of those couple of dynamics.","Regarding capital going forward, so we said we expect 2019 to be roughly $2.3 billion. 2020, you should expect to be relatively similar to 2019, maybe a little bit lower. And then beginning in 2021, that number should drop dramatically, probably $0.5 billion or so because as we mentioned, we should be substantially complete with EOTF projects in the U.S. by the end of 2020. So hopefully that gives you some more information related to the capital.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Kevin, two questions, Kevin, you caught up the U.S. comps outpace the benchmark about 100 bps for the year. If my math is right, it sounds like you guys were flat against the benchmark in 4Q. So curious what incrementally changed primarily in the in the year as the value environment was fierce throughout 2018?","And I guess specifically, did the 50 bps headwind you saw from remodel construction in the first nine months accelerate in 4Q with a greater than expected number of projects? And then separately, this one is for Kevin or Steve, CapEx - can you talk about how you arrived at the guidance for 2,000 U.S. remodels in '19? Just given the fluid nature of discussions with operators and the topic, is the guidance based on some form of buying commitment or is the guidance based on a best case estimate, if you will?","Kevin Ozan","So let me start and then I'll turn it to Steve to talk about kind of how we're going about process wise in the U.S. Related to the comp GAAP, you're right. It was relatively flat in the fourth quarter to get up to that 100 basis points for the year. I guess I would just say you saw the industry throughout the year certainly was competitive both from a price and value perspective. So I think we're pleased in that environment that we achieved 100 basis points GAAP for the year. But to your point it was relatively flat in the fourth quarter.","Regarding the headwind, I'll say that EOTF costs, the fourth quarter was roughly 0.5 point. So that's kind of in line with where we had been in third quarter, roughly 0.5 point for the year, I think we expect as we progress into 2019 that will start dissipating so that by mid-year or so that should turn to be a positive impact. So again, partly because of the lower number of projects in 2019 and partly because of all the projects we did in 2018.","Steve Easterbrook","The second part of the question, Andrew, are we confident in those numbers? I mean, we have through the course of the 10 field office visits that Chris Kempczinski and the leadership team conducted, clearly we're keen to offer operators the chance to what we've described level load their commitments depending on how many projects they had left and just their own sort of cash flow management obviously.","So we were really encouraged and shock but we still believe and know that the majority of those of the operators have come forward and they want to rate either retain the existing schedule or maybe level load across '19 and '20 but really want to take advantage of the partner that we have in place. And I think it reflects the confidence they're beginning to see. I mean, once you start to look at the impact of the EOTF, as you start to look at the ample digital menu board, then you start to introduce delivery alongside the self-order kiosks being half hospitality that combined suite of initiatives really is generating much stronger lift.","If you look at the - those are completed, now we've got about 8,000 restaurants complete here in the U.S., we've got fact-based data to share with the operators which I think just continues to build that confidence. So I think the operators appreciated the chance of flexibility but the vast majority will complete within the next two years.","Kevin Ozan","Just one last thing I'd add. Just - our 2,000 estimate right now is based on conversations with the operators. So we did - that could change a little bit as we get down to formally planning the exact timing over the next couple of months. There haven't been signed letters or anything like that yet, but based on the conversations we've had, that's where those numbers are coming from.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","A question and then just a quick follow-up on a comment Steve made in the prepared remarks, I just want to clarify. The question is again on EOTF interested at that most of the franchisees are sticking with the original schedule. But I guess to the extent that for the immediate impact has been somewhat mixed or is less visible to those on the outside. Have you contemplated or had anyone contemplated perhaps not co-investing as heavily and just allowing EOTF to roll out on its own with maybe returning more cash to shareholders?","I mean it sounds like it's sort of a done deal at this point. But it\u2019s been asked by sometimes even hard to effectively tack those in ROI given relatively flattish market share and some of that went listing. And then just my question - my clarification was, can you characterize the market share price has increased in the competitive and I was just wondering if that meant you're seeing - what you're seeing in terms of promotional activity [indiscernible] are you seeing any kind of trade up or down?","Kevin Ozan","I'll start with the first part and then I'll let Steve come back and talk about market share stuff. Thanks for the question Sara. You know, related to EOTF and our kind of commitment and investment in that, we've seen it be really successful around the world consistently. It generally increases customer satisfaction, we've certainly seen sales increases around the world and we are seeing that same dynamic in the restaurants in the U.S. that we've converted.","So we're committed to investing. We believe that our ability and willingness to invest in our restaurants at a relatively quick pace help some kind of separate us a little bit from others in the industry. And so we believe it's an advantage for us to be able to use our financial strength and be able to invest at the right pace and the right time in the U.S. business. So that's why we're continuing to do that.","Steve Easterbrook","And Sara, on the market share, I think it's probably both IEO and the sort of the broader Informal Eating Out and then the most specific to us the QSR market share is incredibly muted. I mean if there's any growth at all, it's going to be more likely in the QSR and largely a lot of that is down to new units additions.","So I guess what that means is any traffic gain units get will be at the expense of someone else. All those people particularly in eating out a little less often and we can respond to those sorts of trends with home delivery, for example. But frankly, we're not expecting any tailwinds from broader growth in either IEO or QSR. Now, if you want to choose to play in one of those, must about being QSR so I feel good about that.","And there's a lot of discussion that we have with our markets. It\u2019s absolute sales growth is always attractive. That top line growth like-for-like sales is clearly always encouraging in a positive trend. But no matter what your markets and conditions are, as long as you're gaining share, you're going to end up in a better competitive position in the long term. So we look at market share very closely and we have a pretty aggressive mindset to it. We don't expect, as I said, just to reiterate, we're not expecting any tailwinds, so our share gains will be someone else's pain.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer","Just looking ahead to 2019 and looking back to 2018. Traffic obviously slowed down last year particularly earlier in the year. When you look at the foundations you've created and the important changes that you're making heading into this year what are the most important ones when it comes to accelerating traffic in the U.S. in particular? And then with regard to the delivery business I would imagine you'll start in-app ordering at some point and with some advertising support behind that. Is the consumer data available only for in-app orders and not through orders through Uber Eats?","Kevin Ozan","Let me take both of those. So I think the market where we really want to drive traffic momentum which will help the overall global figure is clearly the U.S. So I think we have a pretty clear perspective on where the - happening and we just need to get a greater focus on addressing those.","So to be very specific we continue to look traffic at a greater level than we want at breakfast. We're doing well with average check growth but we really want the customer comes back and more often. So there are a number of initiatives that we are going to be deploying some of these real nuts and bolts stuff just looking at our staffing levels across those key - day mass. Clearly menu innovations always play a part.","We believe the shift back into local breakfast value from a national value on the Breakfast Day part will help us fight against the local competition I guess the local consumer taste better. We believe we are on still - McCafe and the McCafe brand both through coffee and premium coffee.","And also we do believe that more personalized digital engagement can also help drive our breakfast business but that's through having customers enjoy the experience and convenience of order and pay and also more personalized and tailored offers in the app.","So that's just an example of the focus we have on breakfast particularly across the U.S. and that was hearing when I was in the field offices down in Louisiana and Georgia earlier in the year. Also we're continuing to fine-tune the value in deal promotions.","I mean you're familiar with the four for $6. We have two for $5. And of course the $1 $2 $3 menus as entry-level platform in that deal combinations. We're going to continue working on product availability or product offers within those combinations and they can get more competitive as we view that up.","Then finally, the one which again I'm excited about and its nuts and bolts McDonald's restaurant operations type discussion is a renewed focus on the drive-thru operation and then just making sure that we really submitted the model that we're seeing.","So I think there's a number of areas where we believe the guest count traffic are growing and some - all of that is within our control. So that feels good. With regard to the in-app, now we can get several consumer data by third-party operators.","But clearly integrating into our app will give us a fuller data set. So we can clearly data privacy is foremost in our mind. So we always respect that. But we are getting some useful information now but we're more optimistic as we get in there probably in the third quarter of this year integrated more into our app and actually then secure all that information that data set on customers and be more useful to them.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","In some of the markets that have had Experience of the Future longer in the U.S. Are there any metrics you can share specifically TF usage? And then are you seeing any signs of greater app adoption or app usage in those areas when you sort of have the kiosks for customers into that digital ecosystem?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. So our most advanced advantage probably for example that really started adopting self-order kiosks earlier than anyone else and let me have some fast follower being Australia, Canada Italy, Netherlands for example. What we're intending to see is significant year-on-year usage percentages but in store customers.","So I guess what I'm trying to say greater percentage of customers that go into our restaurants are using the kiosk and they get more confident with it, they get more familiar with it. They enjoy just the time they're able to spend on it and ultimately going in groups and then group order for example.","So we are seeing some restaurants with as high as 80%, 90% of in-store guests using the kiosks. And particularly now as we had the enhanced hospitality with that they can just order pay on credit go straight to their table and we'll bring the order out. So it really has transformed the experience. So we're actually seeing not just our own data we're seeing customer satisfaction measure dramatically increase.","So we're using these learnings to actually help markets that's still in the process of rolling our EOTF for the U.S. and so some other emerging markets because the data is powerful the data is proving on the business case and that's why we're going to continue supporting it as we go.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Two questions, one just on the U.S. franchise system, seems like they're getting increased visibility with the formation of their kind of women association and I guess we're seeing more reports talking about some frustration with things like delivery and investment the EOTF which you guys have talked about in the past.","And I guess as all QSR peer seemingly having a - always have a small portion of franchisees out of this quarter. So I'm just wondering Steve maybe whether your concern that this concerns at McDonald's are more on escalating kiosks like it damage the system or maybe you can tell us what you think the biggest concerns on push-backs are.","And my follow-up is just for Kevin. I just want to clarify what you said about 2019 EPS. I know you said it will be pressured but I wasn't sure whether that was benchmark and against where consensus is or versus your high single-digit kind of long-term outlook or how we should think about the reference to it being pressured. Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes I'll take the first one and around the U.S. - our owner-operator sentiments and our commitment to this bigger bolder vision plan. So again let's just keep in context just quite how ambitious the plan that the operators and our leadership team build together and that was always going to be hard work. In 2018 it was a year of hard work. It was a year when we as a company and the owner\/operators individually become to write more significant checks as they were committing to the plan.","So the dialogue always going to happen. The dialogue always does. Sometimes it's in a low level sometimes it just bubbles up a little. I think the good news is we're talking and our teams and the Owner\/Operator leadership are talking with one another to see how we can help maintain the confidence in the plan - maintain the commitment to the plan if there's any adjustments or amendments that we need that we can make those as we roll.","So I wouldn\u2019t life be great if everyone was happy of course I am fundamentally concerned and it will derail from the shared ambition we have no I\u2019m not at all. And I think just the fact that the dialogue continues means that we\u2019re going to get to a good place and one where we\u2019ll turn out of work feeling excited about the opportunity that we\u2019re facing because more time we can be consumer facing and getting in our restaurants and activate in the plan - because of customer experience and the business results. Again I could hear that first hand from my market as it's this year but in the pattern erosion across Atlantis so the door is always open on that.","Kevin Ozan","And then Jeff regarding where I mentioned there will be some pressure on EPS growth this year. I'm not comparing versus consensus I\u2019m just talking about our internal targets. As I mentioned here just on one time things like games we will be ratcheting down between 2018 and 2019.","So that impacts that EPS growth rate until one-time of a change if you will but we've always known we\u2019ve always talked about our refranchising starting to roll off related to depreciation that I mentioned is obviously pressure on margins if you will in 2019 related depreciation.","Now that won't impact cash flow or anything like that but it\u2019s obviously has an impact on just bigger EPS growth rate so that\u2019s all I was just trying to say.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Two as well please one Steve you mentioned consumer confidence and other sort of cautionary notes about 2019 was that directed at maybe the year has been little softer after softer start than you thought or is that just sort of standard there's always things in the world to worry about. And then specifically on EOTF I suspect slowing the pace of the conversions probably help sales in 2019 maybe you can comment if there is a change or less burden on sales relative to that.","And you also mentioned that your level loading I think at the end of 2019 it will be 10,000 converted in the U.S. and so there is another 4000 to go is that 2000 and then the rest just don't have to get done or how do you think about level loading if you got more to do still then to balance of 2000.","Steve Easterbrook","I think Kevin will take the second one. Now I was not looking to signal any short-term as of in those comments. I was just thought it was responsible just acknowledge as you enter 2019 as you look around just a global macro picture it just appears a little less certain entering the last couple of years. I mean evidence with all of us anyway I thought it was worthy of note but no I don\u2019t want that to be read into any form of indication of how the year started.","And then regarding two things one kind of the ETOF impact as you call it yes, by doing a little less projects in 2019 it actually will be a benefit more of a benefit to sale then if we had done 4000 projects in 2019. So that\u2019s when I mentioned where the ETOF impact if you look at all the pieces should start off turning positive by midyear versus the direct that has been really all of this year.","Regarding the number of restaurants or accounts if you will of the EOTF projects, right now through 2018 we\u2019re little over 7500 restaurants complete if you will. If you then think about roughly 2000 being done in 2019 and roughly 2000 being done in 2020. And then likely another 1000 or so remaining that would happen in 2021 and 2022 that gets us to roughly most of the estate because at the same time there are some that we are either relocating or we have rebuild.","And so you get another 1000 or so just of restaurants if they are relocate to rebuild over all of those years that gets you to roughly 13,500 or so of our 14 plus thousand estate that substantially all of them. They'll be a few restaurants that we don't get to won\u2019t be a lift.","Kevin Ozan","I just want to hook, I want to go back to Karen's question regarding the app usage trajectory because I don\u2019t think I address that. I want to finish into the broader perspective because you\u2019re asking around self order kiosks basically but it first. All of our technology initiatives whether it\u2019s the global mobile app will be done from mobile order pay introduction of self order kiosks, the use of outdoor digital menu boards.","So as we build the kind of customer relationship management, we\u2019ve now trading this very, very proper ecosystem as we start to connect these technologies together. We'll offer our customer better experience, better value more personalization and we will get to understand our customers and their behaviors so much better.","So I wanted to acknowledge your point that as we start to get identified customers - once we start to unlock that as self order kiosks or as they put into a drive through lane been our ability to smooth their experience make it more convenient, recognize them individually and also learn of them is incredibly powerful.","So these are a lot of foundation investments we're making to create what I think will be an incredibly powerful ecosystem for one of the better word that some is going to provide a lot of knowledge a lot of data for us and a much better experience for our customers.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","I just had one clarification to the earlier CapEx comments and then a question. I think to respond Eric\u2019s question you were referring to 2021 CapEx and the 1.5 billion to 2 billion range but I think previously you\u2019ve said sort of low one to through run rate is 2021 not a long-term number?","Kevin Ozan","So 2019 and 2020 will be roughly the 2.3 billion - I just mentioned we\u2019ll have about a 1000 projects left still for 2021 and 2022. So it won\u2019t get all the way down to the longer term run rate if you will it will be substantially less than 2019 and 2020 but not quite get all the way down to normal ongoing run rates.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","On the U.S. I had a question I think Steve you referenced a couple times sort of operational improvements and be the service and I know I have asked about this many times over the past few years. But just wondering if you could maybe share specific action steps you're taking to improve either service that drive-thru in the U.S. I know you referenced some technology benefits but is there going to be a greater push on add in 2019. And if so how are you going to achieve progress there? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","No, thanks David I mean this is the stuff we kind of really get into. So let me just give you a couple of examples of what we will be doing differently that what we believe will help reduce complexity and as a result improve speed. Introduction of technology we've got some new we just call them zoom boards, but these are little digital screens at the drive through present a window.","So as where we toss out the food we can really start to provide real time service times within the restaurant and where the little bottlenecks can be whether it\u2019s a delivering process, the payment or whether we are maybe we don\u2019t have the food ready but have also lot of parking one of the parking base for example. But any formation real time setting others a positive competitive nature up against the local drive through restaurants so maybe all the other driver-throughs within overall greater group for example.","We seen this operating really successfully in Canada, operating really successfully in Australia and it just provides the competitive spirit also that kind of bottleneck identification. If you\u2019re running that shift you can see why the payment process, we're not handing the cash as quickly as possibly could do why is the ordering process taking slightly longer at the drive-thru? Maybe it's a training issue. Maybe it's a technology issue.","So it just enables those issue identification so much greater that you can address them quicker and keep things moving, so kind of real nuts and bolts stuff we get into but allowing technology to help make our restaurant managers and crews' lives easier.","And totally different one is, we've got to build a much more sophisticated tool for assessing menu complexity where we can understand the volume of certain menu items we sell, the difficulty that it is for us to prepare the average normal production time, the type of gross margin contribution.","It makes our owner\/operators and today it is helping us to better identify where and how we can simplify the menu with the minimum customer systems that have viewers are actually driving customer satisfaction and speed but also protects or enhance gross margins as well.","So it's a much more sophisticated tool that we can run live product next dated through and really start to give much more fact-based information to our teams in the field so they can make these decisions with a much higher level of confidence. So that's just a couple of examples.","But it's across all 10 field offices all 10 of them are have drive-thru service and with Chris mentioned international team have drive-thru focus in service as a key initiative.","Mike Cieplak","We have time for one more question from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Just a few very quick ones and first is actually the follow-up on drive-thru service times. Have you seen those peak? I mean in other words are they continuing to get worse or they're stabilizing? And if they're not stabilizing when might you see those stabilize? That's the first question.","And then secondly what is your experience of delivery to the McDonald's stores in the United States had the longest not just as a percentage of sales basis but are they happy with incrementality and sales? Are they happy with profitability? Are there any changes that you could potentially see in that program to extend franchisees profitability of delivery?","And then the third question if I can is a technical one. Notes receivable and accounts receivable, how are you kind of been bumping up actually for some time. I think there's around $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter. So there anything around EOTF related to that maybe in terms of what you're doing with franchisees and might you expect those accounts to be drawn back down a bit on the source of cash for you in the relatively near-term.","Steve Easterbrook","So I'll happily take the technical one over the [indiscernible] both too. Drive-thru service times have increased year-on-year for about the last five years. We collectively called that to a halt. So we expect to actually reduce service times across 2019 we're starting immediately the activities in quarter one of this year and actually in restaurants currently. So those are collected result service times have to a paint we will not except them for getting any longer and therefore we are looking to address those. So hopefully that response to that question.","On delivery we're seeing just great growth in year-on-year for those that have been offering delivery for more than 12 months. So part of the measurement system we have here is not only just we had new restaurants but only where we want to grow the organic business. If you like - we're now into the lapping like-for-like on delivery, incrementality still remains encouraging in that kind of 70 percentage range, average check still remains around 2 times the normal average in-store.","We note in the day part analysis as well that helps support our belief and covers any incrementally because it's peaking at day parts that we will ordinarily be a single sort of business piece.","So we believe we're well set up to do more. I think the pieces that we're collectively still trying to back him out is how do we drive the awareness because we know as soon as customers try it, they stick with it and jointly stick with it.","So awareness here in the U.S. typically we would want to have a critical mass of our restaurants here 70% plus before we were 17 with national awareness. We're marketing campaign or a broader social media campaign. I will say the local co-ops are getting off for it as of when the critical mass of the restaurants in that total now starts both - as we start to expand with Uber Eats and elsewhere around the world with uBer and on a third-partly operators getting the awareness is one of the key priorities we have. So we feel good about that.","And now I will hand over to Kevin on the front end question.","Kevin Ozan","Yes related to accounts receivable, so really most of that - most of the increase certainly is related to U.S. EOTF projects. The way it works is we generally manage those projects and so wealth project manage all of it and we'll collect from the operators.","And so you are seeing that those balances are up because they've been focused on getting the projects done. Mechanically we need to go through some closing of job in collecting the money from the operators. It is an uncollectible money, it's a timing issue of when we'll actually just receive the - go through the logistics of closing our projects and collecting the money from the franchisees. So yes it should be - it will be at cash inflow as we continue on.","I would expect that receivable number to go down now that there will be some pressure off of the number of projects as you think about 2018 everyone was just driving hard toward getting all the projects done. Now we can get some of the kind of other stuff associated with that done like collecting the money. So that's exactly right.","Mike Cieplak","Okay. Thank you Steve and Kevin and thank everyone for joining our call today. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes McDonald's Corporation Investor conference call."],"13807":["McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Q4 2013 Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2014 11:00 AM ET","","Executives","Kathy Martin - Vice President, Investor Relations","Don Thompson - President and Chief Executive Officer","Pete Bensen - Chief Financial Officer","Tim Fenton - Chief Operating Officer","","Analysts","","Brian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","David Tarantino - Baird","David Palmer - RBC Capital","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Howard Penney - Hedgeye","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Alex Chan \u2013 Jefferies","Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens","","","Operator","Hello and welcome to McDonald\u2019s January 23, 2014 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","","Kathy Martin","Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen; and Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton who is joining us for Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.","Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don.","","Don Thompson","Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. As we embark on a New Year, our systems focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to deliver great tasting and high-quality food and beverages at the speed and at the convenience that only McDonald\u2019s can provide. We have high expectations for ourselves and we have added high expectations for our brand. And we will not waver in our commitment to delivering an exceptional experience for the 70 million customers who visit us every day.","Given the challenging year that we had in 2013, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to adapting to keep pace with changing markets. We remain committed to investing to meet future demand. And we remain committed to addressing performance opportunities in the current environment. As we shared at the November Investor Meeting, our primary focus is on resetting and strengthening the relationship that we have with our customers. They are the driving force behind our mission and we continue to place them front and center in all that we do. We continue to execute against our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and to broaden accessibility, because these are the areas where we have the most significant opportunities to differentiate our sales.","Our near-term opportunities revolve around optimizing current initiatives for greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach and better restaurant execution. In addition, we prioritized our near-term efforts on improvements in key opportunity markets. These include Germany and Japan, which are experiencing sustained negative trends and the U.S. and Australia which are significant contributors to consolidate a performance. Specifically, the leadership teams in these markets are developing more locally relevant solutions based on stronger consumer insights and more recent market learning\u2019s. This would help us to make the appropriate adjustments to regain momentum as we more clearly align with our customer\u2019s needs.","Now, let\u2019s turn to 2013 global results. In constant currencies, operating income was up 1% for the quarter and 3% for the year. Earnings per share growth increased 2% for the quarter and was up 4% for the full year in constant currencies. For the full year global systemized sales grew 3% in constant currencies and global comparable sales grew up 20 basis points. Comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter. Guest tracking was down across major segments reflecting initiatives that didn\u2019t resonate as strongly with consumers amid a sluggish IEO industry.","2013 was a difficult year and we\u2019re keenly aware of our short term challenges. Due to economic predictions are mixed but most assumed some limited global improvement in 2014. However we don\u2019t expect significant changes in market dynamics given modest growth projects for the IEO industry. Looking to January global comparable sales are expected to be relatively flat.","Now let\u2019s shift to the markets, U.S. comparable sales decreased 140 basis points for the fourth quarter and 20 basis points for the entire year. Operating income was up 1% for both periods. Our U.S. 2013 results fell short of our expectations. We introduced a number of significant new products and limited time offers at a quick pace to challenge more effective restaurant and marketing execution.","Our 2014 menu and marketing strategies better balance affordability with core products, new choices and limited time offers. For example the recent evolution to Dollar Menu and More intended to drive customer visits by offering greater value and variety while improving restaurant profitability and in today results are in line with initial expectations.","We have also adjusted the sequencing of product introductions making it easier for restaurant teams to execute especially when it comes to training and staffing. So customers can truly enjoy an even better experience. Now these adjustments are complimented by a consistent focus on core equities like breakfast where a unique competitive advantage exist for McDonald\u2019s.","We\u2019re enhancing the breakfast experience by creating more of a coffee culture through high quality McCafe products they pair very well with delicious foods both existing and new. And additional change is underway focusing in our brand strategies as we work to better resonate with our customers. In constant with other changes that we have made in the marketing organization yesterday we announced that Deborah Wahl will be joining our U.S. business as Chief Marketing Officer.","We look forward to the fresh perspective that Deborah will bring as she leads the team as we refine our marketing strategies and our execution plans.","Now let\u2019s move to Europe where comparable sales were up 1% for the quarter and flat for the year. In constant currencies operating income was flat for the quarter and up 4% for the year. Despite persistently low consumer confidence across the zone the UK, Russia and France generated positive comparable sales for the quarter partially offset by negative comparable sales in Germany and Southern Europe. The UK and Russia continued to grow promotions like Russia\u2019s American Classics generated excitement and the introduction of appealing menu platforms including blended ice in the UK created additional reasons for our customers to visit McDonald\u2019s.","The UK also remains committed to daypart expansion. Efforts centered on extended hours, breakfast and the family business are driving momentum throughout the day. In France December marked five consecutive months of positive comparable sales. Strong promotional activity and an ongoing emphasis on relevant value offers like Casse Croute help fuel our momentum.","Given uncertainty around consumer reaction to recent VAT increases and current economic indicators that do not reflect improvements in market dynamics. We remain cautiously optimistic about France.","Let\u2019s turn to Germany where we see significant opportunities for improvement with new Company leadership in place and fresh perspectives among our franchisee leadership team. The markets goal is to stabilize this trend and begin rebuilding brand relevance. Driven by deeper insights we\u2019re refining our plans to focus on fewer yet better tactics than more closely aligned with local customer needs. For example October\u2019s launch of the McBaguette, a two item value bundle that mirrors the very successful cash Casse Croute in France. However with a German influence exceeded expectations because it's a high quality product at a price point where we previously had a gap to consumer expectation.","Let\u2019s now shift to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMEA, where comparable sales were down 2.4% for the quarter and down 1.9% for the full year. In constant currencies, operating income was relatively flat for both the fourth quarter and the year. Japan comprises roughly a third of APMEA\u2019s comparable sales though the market contributed less than 15% to the segment\u2019s operating income. Amid a highly competitive environment, Japan continued to experience significant comparable sales in guest count declines. Along with new leadership in this market, Japan is taking the steps necessary to strengthen the McDonald\u2019s brand connection with consumers. This includes repositioning its affordability strategy in concept with additional emphasis on hospitality and more relevant menu news for both the new and core foods and beverages.","In Australia, comparable sales were relatively flat for the quarter. The appeal of new McWraps and Salads did help to build average check. Looking ahead, the market plans \u2013 the market plans are anchored around being even more relevant with local consumers. We are emphasizing value across all price tiers and we are launching more premium products to create excitement across the menu.","In China, comparable sales decreased 40 basis points for the quarter, a sequential improvement over the last nine months and were down 3.6% for the full year. Our enhanced all day value platform is generating improvement and will continue to expand convenience initiatives, including dessert kiosk and delivery. And we will work to grow the family business across the market. Given the opportunities inherent in a growing more prosperous middle class, we also continue to grow through expansion in China. We opened 275 restaurants last year. Around the world, our holistic approach, which begins with the customer experience, is guiding our actions. And as our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our first priority is making disciplined investments in the opportunities that will grow the business over the long-term.","In 2013, we opened more than 1400 new restaurants and reinvested in our base of existing restaurants, including our re-imaging efforts. After capital expenditures, we expect to return all of our free cash flow over the long-term to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Last September, our Board of Directors announced a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.81 per share in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2013, we returned a total of $4.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And in 2014, we expect to return approximately $5 billion.","In closing, I remain confident in McDonald\u2019s future and more specifically our ability to strengthen our relationships with our customers. My confidence is grounded in the fact that we are targeting the opportunities that exist within our three global growth priorities to optimize the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s. Our plans are supported by a comprehensive execution approach, which leverages all three legs of the system to satisfy customer expectations and drive improved business performance.","The alignment of franchisee, supplier partners and employees is strong and critical to our success and our strong local market structures enable us to more deeply understand and better execute those initiatives, which are most important to our customers in their local markets. These distinct competitive advantages are the reason we are well positioned to deliver enduring profitable growth today and for the long-term.","Thanks again everyone and I will now turn it over to Pete.","","Pete Bensen","Thanks Don and hello everyone. Though McDonald\u2019s grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share in 2013, our financial performance did not meet our high expectations. However, I am confident in the underlying strength of our system, our business model and competitive advantages to deliver strong performance over the long-term. We entered the year with a renewed energy around engaging more deeply with our customers. We placed the customer at the center of everything we do and we have the resources and infrastructure to meet our goal of becoming our customer\u2019s favorite place and way to eat and drink.","So how will we do this and what will be different in 2014? We are leveraging consumer insights to better understand how we can deliver on evolving consumer needs. This includes enhancing our value based messaging and reengaging with customers in more compelling ways from our marketing and promotions to the order points that are restaurants. We have identified areas where we can improve and are prioritizing the initiatives that are most impactful to our customers and we continue to move forward with investments that will drive long term growth than returns.","Turning to 2013 performance, so revenues grew modestly at 2%, we prudently managed our expenses and maintained full year combined operating margin of 31.2%. Our operating margin continues to compare quite favorably to other large global consumer companies and restaurant businesses. Our profitability is driven by restaurant margins. Franchising remains core to our business model with 81% of our global restaurant operated by local business men and women. Franchise margins account for about 70% of total restaurant margins. In constant currencies, consolidated franchise margins increased 2% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and 3% to $7.6 billion for the full year. Our franchise business model is resilient ultimately dependent upon topline growth to maintain or expand margins over time. As a result of relatively flat comparable sales and higher occupancy cost the consolidated franchise margin percent declined 90 basis points for the quarter to 82% and declined 60 basis points for the full year to 82.4%.","Consolidated company operating margins declined 60 basis points to 17.2% for the quarter and fell 70 basis points to 17.5% for the year. Higher operating cost in both periods amid weak comparable sales contributed to the margin declines.","We\u2019re diligently managing restaurant expenses but we expect cost increases to continue pressuring margins in 2014. Looking at segment performance in the U.S. negative comparable sales in fourth quarter combined with 2% higher commodity cost and increased labor costs resulted in a 50 basis point decline in company operated margins to 19%.","For the full year margins declined 110 basis points to 18.4% primarily due to higher labor, commodity and other expenses coupled with weak comparable sales.","From a pricing standpoint we ended the year with a 3.1% increase in the U.S. This is a result of several smaller menu board increases taken through 2013 and an effective 50 basis point increase in November due to the introduction of the Dollar Menu and More.","The food away from home inflation index ended the year up 2.1% which was at the low end of the expected 2% to 3% range. For comparison the food at home inflation index was significantly lower at 0.4% well below the expected range of 1% to 2%.","Overtime we seek to price in-line with food away from home. As we look to 2014 both food away from home and food at home inflation is currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% although updated forecast are due in the coming days. We will continue to monitor these two indices closely. Balancing our desire to drive traffic to our restaurants with strategically managing margins and cash flow. On the expense side we expect 2014 U.S. commodity cost increases of 1% to 2% with more pressure in the first half of the year.","Turning to Europe, in fourth quarter this segment increased company operated margins 30 basis points to 19.4% as positive comparable sales performance offset 1% higher commodity cost and increased occupancy expenses. For the full year margins increased 10 basis points to 19.2%. Europe\u2019s company operated margins benefited from strong performance in France as well as Russia and the UK. Combined these markets contribute over 60% of Europe\u2019s company operated margin dollars. At year-end Europe\u2019s price increase excluding Russia was about 1.5%. We remain very deliberate with our pricing given cautious consumer sentiment, VAT increases in markets like France and ongoing austerity measures, all of which pressure disposable income.","Europe\u2019s 2014 commodity costs are also expected to increase about 1% to 2% with more pressure in the second half of the year. In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, our three largest markets experienced negative comparable sales in both fourth quarter and the full year with Japan having the most significant impact. Though the challenges differ across markets, we believe that emphasizing McDonald\u2019s key advantages of value, convenience and service will be critical to long-term growth in this segment. We tailor these advantages in different ways within each local market from providing affordable entry points through dessert kiosks in China, to enhancing everyday value platforms in China and Australia, to expanding our web ordering and delivery service in Japan.","Markets across APMEA have some of our best customer service scores and we are encouraged by our continued progress. Quite simply, we want more customers to visit McDonald\u2019s more often. We will continue to innovate and invest across the diversified portfolio of markets within this promising area of the world. Relative to profitability, APMEA\u2019s company-operated margins declined 180 basis points for the quarter to 12.6% and declined 170 basis points to 14.2% for the full year as higher labor, occupancy and other costs pressured margins.","New store openings in China continued to negatively impact APMEA\u2019s margins in both periods as well. Consolidated G&A was flat in fourth quarter and down about 3% for the full year in constant currencies. The full year decrease was driven primarily by lower incentive-based compensation. As discussed at the November Investor Meeting, we expect 2014 G&A to increase above $200 million or 8% in constant currencies reflecting the impact of below target 2013 incentive pay, expenses associated with our worldwide Owner Operator Convention in April and sponsorship of the upcoming Winter Olympic Games in Sochi and cost to support restaurant growth, capacity enhancements and digital initiatives.","Our full year 2014 effective tax rate guidance is 31% to 33%, although we do expect volatility between quarters given our global business. As a reminder, first quarter 2013 results reflected a one-time tax benefit of nearly $50 million related to the retroactive impact of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. This contributed $0.05 to EPS in first quarter last year, which we will be lapping this quarter. McDonald\u2019s resilient business model continues to generate significant cash from operations. As Don mentioned, our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business. We are the global market leader and we intend to continue leveraging this competitive advantage. We will accomplish this through a balanced measured approach to investing in new and existing restaurants to drive future growth than returns.","Looking to 2014, over half of our $2.9 billion to $3 billion of capital expenditures will be used to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants. We will grow to the opportunity in both established and emerging markets further enhancing our diversified portfolio. The breakdown for openings in our geographic segments is as follows: 250 in the U.S., 320 in Europe and 830 in APMEA, including about 300 new restaurants in China. We also continue to modernize our brand through re-imaging. We updated 1,529 locations in 2013, a little shy of our projection of over 1,600. This shortfall was spread fairly evenly across the segments. As we continued \u2013 as we make continued progress and some markets reach completion, our passive re-imaging is naturally slowing. This is reflected in 2014 plans that call for over 1,000 total re-images. This reduction is also the result of planned kitchen investments in the U.S. that are being prioritized in 2014. These new high density kitchen prep tables are designed to deliver enhanced service capabilities and menu choice to our customers. Lastly let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by $0.01 and the full year by $0.05.","At current exchange rates we expect first quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.02 to $0.03 with a full year negative impact of $0.05 to $0.06. As always take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout 2014.","We begin 2014 energized by our opportunities yet mindful of the challenges in front of us. We\u2019re the global leader in a $1.2 trillion highly fragmented industry. We\u2019re one of the strongest brands in the world with significant competitive advantages. Together with our outstanding owner\/operators and suppliers whom we believe are the best in the business. We proudly serve 70 million customers every day and we aligned to drive enduring profitable growth for the McDonald system and our shareholders in the years to come.","Thanks now I will turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A session.","","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Kathy Martin","Thanks Pete. I\u2019m going to now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). Again we will try to give as many people possible the opportunity to ask questions. So if you can try to limit yourself to one we will get back to you for a follow-up as time allows.","Our first question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","","Brian Bittner \u2013 Oppenheimer","Kind of big picture thoughts question here. I just think about over a decade you know for the last decade up until 2012 you guys really average the same store sales increase around that 5% range and you know overtime and Don you\u2019re at the heart of this but you guys had such compelling bottoms up drivers in the business and just we\u2019re executing against much lower sales per unit than you set at today. But as you said year-to-date seems the bottoms of drivers have just faded a bit from what they used to drive and the bottom-line I guess comps have hit this sluggish cycle and the question here is there anything that you see from a new platform perspective or new business layer perspective that you can go after to get back to those mid-single digit comps across the system or do you really sit here and look at your businesses today and think about it much more is being relied on the macro and much less about specific things that you can do to drive it.","","Don Thompson","We really believe Brian the strategic areas that we need to focus on to grow this business into the future. Those are somewhat consistent and we still have opportunities and those being around our menu and the menu being relevant really enhancing the customer experience and you guys know quite a bit about the execution focus and getting back to a stronger customer relationship this year as well as accessibility and affordability. Those areas are the right strategies; this affordability aspect is a very, very key component of our growth as we move forward. So we think we\u2019re in the right area with those strategies. The key is going to really be to reestablished the trust of customers.","When we look across the broader range that is one of the consistent things that we see and that means basic execution at a restaurant level market engagement at a much stronger level and also to make sure that our menu is relevant. There are some other aspects of that that we have talked about being digital engagement, we have really not played in that arena in a strong way and clearly you all know based upon them and some of our conversations that our intent is to be much stronger with regard to our digital outreach and digital engagement focus.","So we\u2019re focused really, you mentioned macro-economics. We\u2019re focused on those things within our control to drive our performance. This is going to be a market share battle and a market share battle gain in order for us to move the business but we believe we have the right strategies and the right focus at local levels in the markets to achieve the goals that we have. One of the things we have all discussed is that we got to really get back to a much stronger focus on what we call 5P execution. When we talked about the plan of win, people, product, place, price, promotion. Those five areas we have got to make sure that we\u2019re maxing out our execution strategies for whatever initiative that we implement in any market around the world. That\u2019s going to help us create that relevance again with our customer.","So those focal points along with the priority focused on the key markets that we know we have challenges in and an even stronger fashion which Tim and teams are doing. I believe will get us the growth that we need not only for the current year but as we move forward Brian.","","Kathy Martin","All right our next question is from Matt DiFrisco, Buckingham Research.","","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","My question is with respect to margins. I think you alluded when you talked about APMEA specifically about China having a little bit of a drag obviously because it\u2019s a company-owned mix where it\u2019s a franchise mix, but I wonder if you could comment on China, the company-owned margins, is there de-leverage there as well, I would assume with the slower comp? And then if you could sort of tie that in also how we should think, Pete, of the direction of the comp, I am sorry, the margin in the U.S. when you rollout and we start to see the kitchen equipment being put in there? Absent a comp lift, would we be seeing also a margin benefit from that initiative of new equipment coming into the stores?","","Pete Bensen","Alright, Matt, I will give it a shot. China as you mentioned, we saw both. Our comparable stores did have a decline in margin as well as the impact of the new restaurants coming online although that impact of the new restaurants was less than it was a year ago. And as I think the excess you listened or we are at our investor conference, you heard Dave Hoffmann talk about some of the initiatives they have underway with their go-to-market strategy to look at bringing cost out of that development, the new development there, which will further lessen the impact of the new openings on the margins going forward there. So that piece of it is moving in the right direction, but as you mentioned, China as well as all the markets around the world, margins are a top line game. And to the extent that we aren\u2019t driving the comp sales that we need there, the margins will continue to be a little bit pressured.","In the U.S., specifically U.S. around the kitchen equipment, but more broadly, one of the positives, if you will, out of the fourth quarter was we saw some margin benefit from the dollar menu and more pricing aspect. So we did see a little bit of positive impact to the chef there. As we rolled this new kitchen equipment out, it\u2019s going to have a couple of different impacts. One obviously some of what we have talked a lot is design to improve our throughput, improve our order accuracy, offer more choice and variety to the consumer. So from that standpoint, obviously that\u2019s a \u2013 should be a positive for the business. It\u2019s on the negative side of that so to speak. It will be additional investment. It will have additional depreciation associated with that some additional training. So in and of itself it\u2019s not a one single piece that\u2019s going to make or break the margins next year. We will continue to see commodity pressure. We had about 14 states raise minimum wage here effective January 1 with others making noise about doing the same thing, commodities, healthcare costs. So costs will continue to be a challenge for us in 2014 as we think about the margins.","","Operator","And our next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. And more broadly Don or Pete, we are in a tough operating environment than you have been in a while, your advantage versus the peers seems to have shrunk and these are all things we have known for a while, maybe sales get better because you continue to push out these initiatives, but it may also be that we are just in a lower sales environment. So if that is a backdrop, what are the other things that you consider in looking at how to enhance the performance. So for example, many of your peers over the last several years have gone through more significant refranchising rounds. Is there an opportunity there? We have talked in the past while looking at your balance sheet, it doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s something you are inclined to do, but maybe willingness to revisit that. Looking at even corporate cost cutting, are there opportunities there to create a leaner organization given this leaner \u2013 these leaner economic times or leaner performance times. Any thoughts there will be helpful?","","Don Thompson","Yes, John thanks much for the question. Let\u2019s go back to how we view and look at performance and some of the data and what we actually see. If we look in the U.S. particularly, one of the things that we see today is a bit of a bifurcation on a consumer base. So some of the fast casuals are performing a bit better and customers are skewing that way a little bit more as a result of a bit more discretionary income and that economic class of individuals. So we also know that those customers that tend to come to us are fairing quite as well in the current economy in the U.S. Having said that, what we have to do John in the near term is focus on the value base, focus on some of the things that we know are going to be critical in terms of the execution of our menu. I am going to ask Tim in a moment to kind of speak a little bit to the key markets, because I don\u2019t want to just pass over that too briefly. There are a lot of opportunities we feel we have in the key markets. So Tim will give an update there. Relative to looking at things like refranchising, opportunities. We\u2019re constantly looking at that John and yes we do have a longer term plan relative to where we refranchise and opportunities there along with optimizing the portfolio in our major markets. G&A wise we are continuously looking at that and clearly as a pay for performance culture we don\u2019t perform as Pete mentioned the incentive based compensation in that part of G&A comes down. There are other areas that we reduce G&A and it's because we\u2019re continuing to focus on some strategic changes to our structures and our efficiency and effectiveness.","So we\u2019re going to continue to look at those areas but I will tell you we have to be customer relevant. The way to drive the business is going to be through the top line growth which means the execution in the restaurant it means the product focus that we have and it means the way that we\u2019re addressing customers and engaging them. So with that Tim if you wouldn\u2019t mind speak a little bit to some of the key markets that you see and opportunities.","","Tim Fenton","Key markets that we\u2019re looking at, obviously the U.S., Germany, Japan and relatively new leadership in the U.S., Germany and Japan as well and each team is focused on making those adjustments necessary to regain the momentum. Specifically in the U.S., energizing consumer messaging and market execution. We stumbled a little bit last year with too many new products, too fast and create a lot of complexity. As we mentioned in November reestablishing our breakfast with a lot of emphasis on beverage and coffee. We know that coffee drives the visits at our breakfast time and I guess one of the biggest things that we\u2019re looking at and U.S. is focusing on peak hour execution. That goes hand in hand with the enhancements of our prep table. It gives us more capacity in those peak hours and of course menu choice.","In Germany, we\u2019re going to focus on fewer but better tactics built around deeper insights behind what really addresses Germany\u2019s needs. We are responding to the caf\u00e9 and bakery, it really kind of impacted McDonald\u2019s affordability and relevance by introducing such products as the McBaguette fulfill that price point gap.","And of course strengthening our value program and focus more on core and continuing to push breakfast even though it is a low base it is growing for us there. Japan taking steps that we frame what the brand represents to our customers and repositioning the markets affordability strategy. We can\u2019t go head to head with the 45000 convenient stores on price alone we realize that. So we really have to put emphasis on our hospitality a new menu news, both new and core.","","Kathy Martin","All right our next question is from Joe Buckley, Merrill Lynch.","","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I know you mentioned the Dollar Menu and More was meeting your internal expectation so far but could you talk about the extra-value menu experience in 2012 versus the early Dollar\u2019s are more experienced in the latter part of 2013 and how are they comparing contrast? Yeah I know you had to back away from the extra-value menu and just kind of curious the reaction to Dollar Menu and More why you\u2019re encouraged by it and what do you think that\u2019s staying power and can it kind of move the customer traffic needle as you suggest was the goal.","","Tim Fenton","First of all if you look back at 2012 we had extra-value menu, we had extra-value meals plus we had Dollar Menu. Rather confusing not only to our customers but actually kind of confusing to us. With the Dollar Menu and More it's meeting our expectations during the test. It was designed to really stretch out our products of variety and give us flexibility in pricing. It's simpler, it's easier. It's only been in stores for a couple of months and the couple of months was through the holiday period. We\u2019re seeing slight gains in guest counts and of course as Pete mentioned earlier it's margin friendly. So far so far so good, and it was a good transition and evolution for where we had to go with our value menus and dollar menu.","","Don Thompson","Hey Joe if I might you know one thing and I have mentioned this in the comments to get back to a stronger relationship with customers. to be very honest extra-value menu while a very solid attempt was based in mining out additional profitability, the consumer part of that from a consumer benefit was not as strong as Dollar Menu and More. Dollar Menu and More is customer focused, customer based builds out to core equity and yields that value the customers in that way. Extra-value menu was really a reformulation of certain products adding some others just to build profitability. So this is what we mean by getting closer and getting back to a strong relationship with the customers.","","Operator","Alright. Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.","","David Tarantino - Baird","Hi, good morning. Don and Pete, actually I have a follow-up to maybe that last comment where you talked a lot about using consumer insights to drive the business more so than you have done in the past? And I think Pete mentioned in his remarks that you have identified some areas where you need to improve? And I know you have alluded to a lot of it so far, but maybe it would be helpful if you could give some specific examples especially in the U.S., where it looks like the relative performance has been pretty soft in the recent months? What have you learned from consumers where McDonald\u2019s brand is currently missing the mark and maybe how does that translate to the tactics you are going to use going forward?","","Pete Bensen","I will tell you what, David, what I would do is I talk to a part of this and I want Tim to talk a little bit to the operations piece of it, because that\u2019s a big part too. So again and I know it\u2019s going to sound like Don, you continue to mention the same thing, but I am going to go back to customer relevance. In the U.S., one of the challenges we have is we have lost some of our customer relevance and we have lost it across several parts of the day. So relative to the breakfast part which Tim just mentioned, this notion on coffee is not just about coffee, it\u2019s about our breakfast business. Coffee too is a big part of the lead for breakfast, but we have great tasting food. If we lose relevance in coffee, then we are going to lose the transaction which yields food purchase. And so we have got to make sure that the food is relevant and that the awareness around McDonald\u2019s as a kitchen and a restaurant that cooks and prepares fresh high-quality food is strong and pronounced in our marketing and our messaging. So we have got to get back to that on food. We have got to get back to an energy and excitement in our marketing balance in the execution of it. And that\u2019s something that all of us have noted, Jeff Stratton and the team in the U.S. have noted. And you have seen some of the changes, which again Tim can update you on relative to even personnel changes in the U.S. So that\u2019s one of the specifics in the U.S. that I could speak to. We talked about value, but Tim maybe on this operations front, because that\u2019s another big one.","","Tim Fenton","One of the things we did last year David, we overcomplicated the restaurants. If you remember, we introduced McWraps, we introduced Egg White Delight, we introduced Quarter Pounder Toppers and really didn\u2019t give the restaurants an opportunity to breathe. We instituted a gatekeeper really with the intent of doing fewer products, but better execution. We mentioned a little bit earlier the capacity on the prep table that allows us really to have more capacity during our peak hours, where we haven\u2019t been able to particularly in some of our drive-through restaurants service quickly and fulfill the capacity that we wanted, so fewer products, better. One other thing and you talk about insights and I want to mention Jeremy, historically, we lost some share based on our insights to non-traditional competitors, caf\u00e9s and bakeries. At the same time, when we were pulling off some of our value offerings, bakery stepped up with value offerings and some of our trade went to non-traditional QSRs, as I said, bakeries and caf\u00e9s. We have learned about that. We are designing our strategy to how we can go back to mitigate that, but that\u2019s a deeper understanding of consumer insights market by market by market.","","Operator","Next question is from David Palmer, RBC Capital.","","David Palmer - RBC Capital","Thanks. In the past, McDonald\u2019s would have operations upgrades like Made for You or the beverage station and that will allow your marketing machine to get cranking over several years oftentimes driving the sales layer. I am trying to figure out if some of these changes that you are doing with the prep tables could be an enabler from an innovation and marketing standpoint as well as something that helps you with peak hour capacity and execution. Could you comment on that please?","","Tim Fenton","Yes. I will make one comment on the marketing piece and there is \u2013 again there is another capacity piece to this. On the marketing end, David, you are right, one of the things that we have done and actually we didn\u2019t do it nearly and strongly with Made for You back in 1998. We implemented Made for You, but we really didn\u2019t come out with a strong marketing campaign that was correlated to it. We have individual markets that didn\u2019t start to benefit, but we didn\u2019t hit it as strong. To that point, even today, customers don\u2019t realize to the greatest extent that at McDonald\u2019s we are making that sandwich, preparing that in the back of the house after you place that order. What does this mean? It means that there is a notion of that again that relationship and the awareness the customers have about who we really are as McDonald\u2019s and what we are able to deliver in that kitchen which is a customized sandwich for you. It's something that we really need to be able to advance in our marketing messages more now. Challenges has been there has been a little concern as to whether or not and how hard we can go with that messaging if we didn\u2019t think we had more capacity headroom. So with that in mind we have done some things with the kitchen and Tim maybe a little bit high density.","","Tim Fenton","Yeah well the high density UHC cabinets we have allows us more capacity and the prep table enhancements not only gives us flexibility and customization with other toppings it gives us the capacity and some of the existing products that we had that we had not to get really operationally technically but we had a cross over and replenishing during peak hours was the last thing you want to do but with the refrigerated rail that we\u2019re adding and we should have this all into the system between the May - June timeframe. It is all just some flexibility with different variety of the toppings, jalapenos, avocado, (indiscernible) and different spice sauces if you will. There is a lot of flexibility and more customization. So it's capacity on existing, it gives us flexibility for new products and new toppings as we go forward.","","Don Thompson","And then we got to tie those together David to your point we have got to tie the marketing messages and awareness into driving this. That\u2019s one of things that you are referenced quite a bit when you talk about coffee. We referenced PR, marketing and the operational pieces together to drive that category and we will do it again.","","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo.","","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Just following on the I don\u2019t know throughput side you\u2019ve discussed the high density, the prep tables, lot of other plans but are you guys planning to add labor to these restaurants? How should we think about that moving forward?","","Tim Fenton","That\u2019s another priority that we have and in fact our (indiscernible) is right now working with all of our operators on just that. Staffing, positioning and scheduling as far as putting the right people on it at the right time particularly during our peak hours. We have to have the additional staffing required for some of the complexity that we have. That was I think one of the stumbling\u2019s we had last year with all the new products we brought in all at the same time or within close proximity. So definitely it is a priority for us and beefing up staff and particular on peak hours and weekends.","","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital","Just a question on kind of broader Europe and I think we have talked about this few quarters about but France seems to have joined the UK and Russia perhaps in recent months. I know Don you mentioned the string of positive comps there and that leaves I guess Germany as the weak major market. One, I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s fair and two, I\u2019m just wondering how we should think about \u201914 whether or not Europe could be the silver linings for the broader company it does seem like at least on the macro data that we see that the trends are stabilizing or perhaps improving across broader Europe. I\u2019m wondering if that is the case where the brand McDonald is seeing that and if what would be a good way to play the improving European macro and if there is anything specific to talk about in Germany and I know you mentioned new leadership but anything else that we should expect to help send that comp to the positive side?","","Don Thompson","I think Tim mentioned some of the things that are taken place in Germany right now and I believe that, you know what\u2019s different about Germany aspect is that this we had a refocusing before. We put something\u2019s in place that were customer focus. We only executed them for shorter period of time and we pulled them out. I think that\u2019s been a lot of learning\u2019s relative to what we should do in Germany along with the fact that whenever you execute a \u201cbest practice\u201d it can\u2019t be adopted. It has to be adapted which is also the difference between McBaguette and Casse Croute. So relative to Germany that\u2019s one of the things that we knew we had to be able to do.","France, I want to echo a comment I made around cautiously optimistic. I think our French team as are we; we have seen some a trend, a positive results. France is still an economy that\u2019s got some troubles to it. There is a VAT increase that I mentioned, we also have some, there is some decisions that will be made soon relative to the French government from a social charge and austerity based prospective. We will have to take a look at, we hope that it will stimulate the economy which will be good for everyone but right now France is still at a point where the 2014 IEO projection is to be down 10 basis points and so it is not a market that is come out yet but we have seen some positive things and in the face of all of those our teams have done a fabulous job. Southern Europe is an area that still has some challenges. And those are macroeconomic challenges. And we just got to make sure we maintained relevance in that area. So Europe as we always say, Europe is not a country. And so when you divide it across the various segments, we see some positive areas and then we see some areas that are still difficult. So we are optimistically looking at performance across Europe, but there are still some challenges there.","","Pete Bensen","And just to add, Jeff, the IEO projections are really modest going forward, the UK plus 50 basis points and Germany plus 50 to 80 basis points.","","Operator","Alright. Our next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.","","Howard Penney - Hedgeye","Hi, thanks very much. I have two questions for you if you don\u2019t mind. The first one is on the high-density tables and when I hear additional capacity or additional customization is the sense that occurs in the \u2013 I think slower service times more than I do faster service times and I apologize for this question, because I actually haven\u2019t those tables in news, so I don\u2019t really understand how they work. So, how does additional customization not equal slow at service times? And then two, can you may be provide a definition of what met internal expectations means, just because the use of the triple times relative to initiatives in 2014 that really haven\u2019t delivered whether it\u2019s reps or (indiscernible)? Well, they may have met internal expectations, they didn\u2019t really drive the business forward and they are also now using that term associated with the dollar, the new dollar menu and more? Thank you.","","Don Thompson","Hi Howard. I will take the piece on internal expectations and I\u2019ll let Tim to talk more about the high density kitchen and impact on operations. But when we say internal expectations, we have clearly a business case for each and every individual initiative that we implement. We have certain criteria that we establish whether that be based upon guest count growth, it might be sales growth, profitability aspects. So we look at those business cases and we have internal expectations set around certain targets. We also have expectations set around the overall accretive nature of an initiative to the broader business. And so when we look as we measure whether or not something was effective and whether or not we are successful we measured against those internal criteria. You guys typically hear us talk about the consolidation of all of the initiatives, which then roll up into an incremental benefit in a comp sales or something that might be associated with our operating income at a total level.","","Tim Fenton","Howard, on the capacity, anytime during our peak hours, if I can keep people in place and not have their feet moving to restock or to get something else or have crossed over last year, we deleted angus it\u2019s a slow moving product for us. So we are working with two proteins and a beef in the kitchen. When I can have the capacity in the prep table, well people don\u2019t have to move, I am just putting different toppings on. You have got the protein coming down the prep table like an assembly line if you will and we are just adding different condiments on. And again, monitoring the pace and the rate of new products that we bring and giving our crews and management ample time to train and get used to before we switch it up and change it on.","","Operator","Alright. Our next question is Greg Badishkanian from Citigroup.","","Greg Badishkanian - Citigroup","Across your biggest markets, have you noticed any change in the competitive environment over the let\u2019s say the last month or two that\u2019s kind of a deviation from the trend?","","Don Thompson","Well, in the U.S. last month in fourth quarter, we had I guess a higher competition as it pertains to value and discounts and so on. And I would say maybe a little bit more in China in the fourth quarter and maybe specifically in Australia, but it\u2019s a very competitive market out there, lot of price going on and it\u2019s a fight for market share. It\u2019s a street fight and we are getting at it.","","Operator","Next question comes from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.","","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. I actually wanted to follow-up on margins, because the restaurants, company-operated restaurant margins look better broadly speaking than I would have expected given some of the sluggish top line and what you have said about your leverage point. So the two questions are can you just talk a little bit more about where there might be opportunities there on that line item. Going forward, you said costs are going to be a headwind, but just how well you can manage that line? And then related note, the outlook for food away from home and food at home inflation and positive fruition [ph] but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really seeing that in the commodity markets. Can you talk about what you think of as kind of your sweet spot translation where you have the ability to take price but it's not so much that it's a real drag on margins physically with U.S. and then broadly. Thanks.","","Pete Bensen","In talking about margins the fourth quarter actually did exceed our own internal expectations when we started the quarter. So if you recall I gave some guidance that imply we expected margins to be down a little bit more in the fourth quarter than they really were and if you look as we look at the reasons for that it was really France and Russia outperformed in the fourth quarter relative to their initial expectations and actually Germany didn\u2019t decline as much as they had originally expected. So Europe was a big piece of that but also the U.S. as I alluded to earlier some of the check benefit that we got from the Dollar Menu and More in the two months it was in was to the positive side as a ledger and also their cost came in just slightly under where they had expected for the quarter.","So it was a combination of factors in different markets that led to that. When we think about 2014, you know food away from home projection of 2.5% to 3.5% the reason I said in my remarks that we expect an update shortly is with the commodity trends and everything else that\u2019s going on. That number might come down a little bit. Now certainly it does also include labor in the restaurants and I mentioned minimum wage increases in 14 states is a piece of impacting that as well but right now we\u2019re going to continue to monitor that indices. We\u2019re also going to look at food at home again that only grew 40 basis points this year. I doubt it will grow 2.5% to 3.5% which is the current forecast based on where commodity trends are but at the end of the day we\u2019re going to look at the pricing as we always do to try to balance growing traffic in the restaurants but also looking at profitability all through that screen that Don mentioned of continuing to improve our relevance with our customers and value is also one area to where relevance to customers matters.","","Kathy Martin","All right we\u2019re running a little low on time, we\u2019re getting close. So we\u2019re going to take a couple more. Next is Andy Barish from Jefferies.","","Alex Chan \u2013 Jefferies","This is Alex Chan for Andy. I wanted to go back to talking about APMEA. During 2012 it seemed like check was really down and traffic kind of held up and this past year in 2013 that kind of reversed I guess how do you find the balance there and when you look at that how do you think about China and kind of avoiding that same issue?","","Don Thompson","Well China specifically they got as an industry hit the QSR and ideal [ph] with the chicken situation that happened in December of 2012 and then the rehit of the Avian influenza and a downturn in just the macroeconomics. Something not unlike what we saw back in 2008 we bounced back in 2009 and 2010 and \u201911. So we in China specifically we stick to our strategy. We feel we have got a sound strategy; we\u2019re being strategic on our openings. We are being strategic on our menu pricing and our points of distribution. ","","Kathy Martin","Okay. Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.","","Will Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens","I had a follow-up question on margins at the restaurant level in particular. At the Analyst Day you talked about the three straight years of margin compression. So I wondered if you can speak more specifically to that path and margin stabilization. Could that occur this year and then maybe more specifics around what that expansion might look like and how that might take place from here?","","Don Thompson","As we looked at the margins over the last couple of years actually just recently looking at a kind of a detailed breakdown by quarter-by-quarter by the line items. One thing that was consistent across the years is that you know the cost pressures kind of in general were in a fairly tight range. It wasn\u2019t a huge spike one way or the other, absent commodities which could have more of a significant impact but they weren\u2019t a significant driver of the margin decline as much as the variation in the top line. And I know we sound a bit like a broken record, but the importance of driving comps in our business to margin profitability is so important and then getting back to that relationship with the customer, improving our relevance is going to lead to that improving top line, which then has that margin flow-through benefit and restaurant level cash flow growth, it\u2019s really the key to getting the economic engine moving in the right direction again.","","Operator","Alright. And this will be our last question, Keith (indiscernible) from UBS.","","Unidentified Analyst","Strengthening the brand to differentiate, it was one of the stated intense and another one was the primary focus of the cash flows is to reinvest in the business. I am just wondering given that strength in underlying cash flow generation in a balance sheet that, yes, I think it clearly provide incremental capital should you want to do, why not accelerate investments now both re-imaging and kitchen investments simultaneously. Is there an operational hurdle to doing so, because it seems like this is a major competitive advantage that McDonald\u2019s has, because in acceleration of this reinvestment in this environment be one of the ways to rekindle and reignite that relationship with the consumer? Thanks.","","Don Thompson","Hi, Keith. I am going to speak to (indiscernible) and I will ask Pete to speak to the other part. The notion of accelerating reinvestment, one of the things that we found across the business and history has dictated to us is that you have to have a balanced focus as we grow the business. So one of the reasons that you haven\u2019t seen us just say we are going to put all of our dollars right into China and let\u2019s just go hard, because we also have other emerging markets that we also want to grow and we want to grow consistently. By growing consistently, it allows us to build up the associated infrastructure from a supply chain perspective, the talent that we need to manage the market and build out the real estate development as well as our ability to be able to put dollars into market and create awareness within those markets to build comparable sales to be able to be a sustaining business model. And so as we look at some of the areas around our capital investment and deployment, we want to be balanced and measured. If it\u2019s something like a kitchen based reinvestment, there is a pace that you can\u2019t go at in the restaurant and at the same time make sure that you are maintaining the penultimate focus, which is to focus on customer satisfaction and expectations.","If we change all of the market at one time and went out and got a bunch of general contractors, what we would find is that we would lessen our ability to satisfy customers and we wouldn\u2019t spread out these activities and execute and affect the plan. So this is one of the reasons you guys talk about we will have a moderate and a steady pace, but on a base as large as ours, our steady pace is pretty aggressive for other people. And so this is the reason we say that. There are some other implications than Pete to probably talk about a couple of those from a financial perspective.","","Pete Bensen","Yes, Keith. I mean, it is much less about the capital, because as you know, we have the ability to throw more at it, but you alluded to operational, it is sequencing and getting these things done in a way, it takes a lot of planning and resources both internal and external contractors to change out the kitchen equipment in 14,000 restaurants around the U.S. So all of the time and energy you need to focus on that to the extent you also try to focus on accelerating re-imaging and a lot of the same kind of contractors or internal people, are needed for both types of projects, you do start to dilute the effect and not get the desired outcome. In addition, we have over 2,000 franchisees in the U.S. So this has to also be done through them considering their individual capacity, their individual cash flows their individual organization strengths. So while I agree with you on paper, it sounds like going faster could be a quicker path to getting some of these relevancy issues dealt with that Don mentioned. The reality and practical nature of a large franchise system with somewhat limited resources in terms of the competencies to work on these kind of projects gets us to kind of the pace that we are adding. And to Don\u2019s point, I think it is a fairly aggressive pace in and of itself.","","Operator","Alright. We will close out with some final thoughts from Don.","","Don Thompson","So once again, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate that and we appreciate your interest in McDonald\u2019s. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our systems are truly a reflection of our ability to learn from our past, to be quite purposeful and agile in the present conditions and environments that we operate in and strategically plan and evolve with our customers as we look to the future. As we mentioned from the onset we are confident in the McDonald\u2019s business and we\u2019re confident that we have the right information, data and business acumen to address the key markets and the other opportunities that we have going forward.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson, and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.","Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don. Don?","Don Thompson","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying that we are disappointed by our recent performance which fell short of our expectations. Global comparable sales decreased 3.3% for the quarter, operating income was down 14% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.09, a 28% decrease in constant currencies.","Third quarter results remain pressured by a number of internal and external factors. A significantly higher tax rate, which was due to an increase in tax reserves in certain foreign markets, impacted earnings per share by $0.26 per share. In addition, the supplier issue in China negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.15 per share, and the estimated impact of store closures in Russia and the Ukraine impacted EPS by $0.01 per share.","Excluding the impact of these items, earnings per share for the quarter would have been relatively flat compared to last year. Pete will talk more about these impacts shortly in his comments.","This morning I\u2019d like to share our strategy for growth and discuss the actions that we\u2019re taking to improve performance in the U.S. and our priority markets of Germany, Japan and Australia. In some of our markets the reality is that we haven\u2019t been changing at the same rate as our customers\u2019 eating out expectations or, more specifically, their expectations of us at McDonald\u2019s. So we\u2019re changing. And we\u2019re changing aggressively as we refocus on building the business for the McDonald\u2019s system and for our shareholders.","The key to our success will be our ability to deliver a more relevant McDonald\u2019s experience for all of our customers.","We have listened to our customers and we\u2019ve listened to our customers around the world and better understand what their future experience should look like. Customers want to personalize their meals with locally relevant ingredients. They also want to enjoy eating in a contemporary inviting atmosphere. And they want choices; choices in how they order, choices in what they order and how they\u2019re served.","These things make up the McDonald\u2019s experience of the future, and we\u2018re building the future today. Our efforts to create this experience in our restaurants build upon the investments that we\u2019ve already made including the Made for You operating platform, modernized decors and leading edge point of sale and mobile technologies, all brought together in a visible, tangible way to enhance convenience for our customers.","In addition to free Wi-Fi in most of our global system, we integrated Apple Pay across 14,000 U.S. restaurants including our drive-throughs. We are the only restaurant to offer this payment convenience in drive-through.","We\u2019re also giving customers more choice in how they order and where they eat. Our multiple order point strategy in countries like France and Australia at self order kiosks as well as mobile orders and payment which support both counter and table service.","Even more importantly we\u2019re offering our customers even more choice as it relates to our menu. This new concept which we call Create Your Taste combine the custom premium burger platform with the service enhancements I just described to deliver a new dining experience that complements our modernized restaurants. It\u2019s all of these initiatives combined that create the McDonald\u2019s experience of the future.","Now we've already moved beyond the innovation centre, we've already moved beyond the learning labs to initial implementation in markets including Australia, the UK and France. And while the food and service components of the experience of the future will look slightly different in each market, based on local customer preferences, I am excited about our ability to differentiate the brand and grow the business. In the US, we\u2019ll fully activate this new experience in three markets by the third quarter of next year and plan to bring additional markets on board as they are ready. And in Australia, plans are already in place to scale the experience of the future across the country next year. We\u2019re working through our global activation plan now and I expect to share more on our next call in January.","Let\u2019s talk a little bit more about the US and the specific actions that we\u2019re taking to improve our business today. There is no doubt the US is our biggest area of opportunity relative to financial performance. The questions I receive a number of times as well or not we can drive additional growth in this very important business unit. Quite simply, the answer is yes.","As you know, Mike Andres took the helm of the US business earlier this month. Mike is a progressive strategic thinker whose deep understanding of consumers and the market place is complimented by a significant industry experience. This past week Mike and I met with our US company and franchise leaders to discuss the tangible steps we\u2019re taking collectively together the reverse business trends today. We also discussed the actions we\u2019re taking to better connect with customers through our food, the service we provide and the experiences that we create.","We\u2019re accelerating efforts to restructure the U.S. organization and provide more economy at the local level so we can satisfy our customers based on their unique taste and preferences in the markets. This shift will enable us to better harness and build on the thinking and the power of the 3000 plus franchises and their entrepreneurial spirit and our restaurant executives who are closest to local market conditions. Our strong menu pipeline in conjunction with greater autonomy in the markets positions these markets to deliver stronger business performance. This has been a historical strength to the US business and we\u2019re putting it back at the forefront once again.","In January, we will simplify our menu to better highlight customers\u2019 favourites and to make the experience faster and easier for our customers and our crew. This move will open up opportunities for local markets to pull from the robust global pipeline and introduce new taste in our key growth categories of burgers, chicken, beverages and breakfast. It will also enable regions to address the unique needs, taste and diversity of the local customers with products like the Chorizo Burrito, Cheddar Bacon Onion, The Clubhouse Burger, Mozzarella Sticks and other menu choices that we have both in the U.S. pipeline and the broader global pipeline.","The step after enhanced local relevance is providing greater personalization and customization on the menu. And Create Your Taste is designed to do just that.","Our marketing approach is another key priority for us and one where we\u2019ve implemented a number of significant changes in the process, the structure and creative direction of our company. We\u2019re also engaging in more transparent dialog with our customers and consumers in general as evidenced by last week\u2019s U.S. debut of Our food Your questions. This build on the success of similar approaches in the UK, Canada and Australia. We are actively inviting customers to join the conversation about the topics that matter most to them relative to McDonald\u2019s particularly the quality of the food we serve in our restaurants.","Conveying the facts and adjusting misperceptions about the freshness, quality and integrity of our ingredients appeal to our customers and supports the work we\u2019re doing to offer greater menu choice.","I am confident in our ability to regain momentum in the U.S. given the actions that we\u2019re taking and the pace at which we\u2019re moving.","Now let\u2019s move beyond the U.S. to China and Russia. The supplier issue in China had a significant negative impact on the market\u2019s third quarter results. Comparable sales were down 22.7% for the quarter. We are aggressively executing recovery plans in the impacted markets. We were able to restore full menu to all restaurants in China and Japan by mid September, thanks to supply chain and resourcing teams who were able to shift to alternative product sources for the 5,000 plus affected restaurants in less than 60 days.","We\u2019re actively taking steps to rebuild consumer trust. We recently launched a significant brand trust campaign in these markets and we\u2019re providing compelling value offers to invite customers back. We expect it will take six to nine more months for our business to normalize in the impacted markets.","Let\u2019s move to Russia where comparable sales remain weak due in large part to the uncertain economic and political environment which is negatively impacting consumer sentiment. With the instability expected to continue through at least fourth quarter and likely in the 2015, we remain focused on continuing to serve high quality menu items and provide a superior restaurant experience.","Another question I'm sure is on your mind is what are we doing to regain momentum in our priority markets outside of the United States particularly Germany, Japan and Australia. Germany\u2019s third quarter comparable sales continue to be negative but showed some signs of improvement. We\u2019re adjusting affordability to drive guest counts to our new single, double, triple burger platform that provides greater value across the burger category. At the same time we\u2019re strategically increasing average check by promoting core, premium and snack items in the markets. Furthermore, the recent changes we made to the marketing organization including a new chief marketing officer and advertising agency will provide innovative thinking and bring fresh new perspectives.","Let\u2019s now shift to Japan. While current results reflect the impact the supply issue in China, weak comparable sales trends had persisted the past several years in Japan. In addition to the work underway to improve food quality perception the market is working to strengthen its appeal to cost conscious consumers through a renewed focus on value. Any size strength have been added to the \u00a5100 menu and new value bundles are now being offered at lunch.","And in Australia, comparable sales in September were solid and represented the highest comp since August, 2012. The market is focused on leading with affordability and convenience by re-launching its loose change menu with additional value option in providing a new way for customers to enjoy McCafe beverages and that\u2019s through the drive-through. And as I mentioned earlier, with aggressive support of the franchisees the market is scaling Create Your Taste in 2015 as part of our McDonald\u2019s experience of the future roll out.","Around the world we\u2019re changing and we\u2019re doing it aggressively. Our business is financially strong and so is our conviction and the future of brand McDonald\u2019s and what we know we can become for our customers. I\u2019m excited about the work that's coming to life in our markets around the world; we\u2019re tacking our challenges head on. We\u2019re building on the power of our unique operating model of franchisees, suppliers and employees to position our business to deliver strong performance to our system and to our shareholders over the long term.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Pete for some additional texture on our performance.","Pete Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. In my nearly seven years as CFO third quarter 2014 was perhaps the most challenging because of the confluence of factors all pointing in the same negative direction.","Similar to Don, I will depart from the usual approach to my prepared remarks. Instead of walking through the income statement, I\u2019ll begin by discussing the four most significant factors impacting quarterly results. From there I will provide the usual updates on some key quarterly numbers, commodities, pricing and currencies. Then lastly, I will address a couple of topics that I recognized are of utmost interest to you our spending levels and our business model.","Let\u2019s begin by reviewing the significant decline in third quarter earnings per share versus a year ago which was primarily due to four factors. The first was a much higher effective tax rate of 44.4%. As indicated in our August sales release, we expected the third quarter rate to be above our annual range of 31% to 33% primarily due to a change in our earnings mix. Subsequent to that sales release, two additional factors drove the effective rate even higher, the tax and interest cost associated with an unfavourable foreign tax court ruling impacting 2003 through 2008 and the impact of additional changes in tax reserves related to income tax audit progression in certain foreign jurisdictions.","In total, the court ruling and our audit related reserve adjustments negatively impacted third quarter earnings by approximately $260 million or $0.26 per share. The second most significant factor impacting third quarter results was the China supplier issue. In early September, we estimated the total impact from loss sales, expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts and the tax effect of these items to be in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per share. The actual impact was approximately $0.15 per share and the impact was felt in virtually every line of our P&L.","The markets most affected by this include China, Japan and Hong Kong which collectively represent about 10% of global system wide sales and about 5% of global operating income. Work is underway APMEA to rebuild customer trust now that our supply chain and restaurant inventories have been largely restored.","While we expect our business to fully recover, the pace of recovery is difficult to forecast. With sales trends showing signs of improvement our best estimate is that it will take at least six to nine more months for our business to return to a normalized level. Based on our current internal forecast we expect the supplier issue to have a negative impact on fourth quarter results in the range of $0.07 to $0.10 per share.","The third significant impact on this quarter\u2019s result was the decline in the McDonald\u2019s U.S. business. The segment operating income declined $107 million or about $0.07 per share primarily due to soft comparable sales which contributed to margin declines.","The fourth most significant impact on our third quarter earnings was the decline in Europe\u2019s company operating margins driven by Russia and Ukraine, due to the economic slowdown, decline in consumer sentiment, store closures and weakening currencies in these markets. In fact, these two countries accounted for substantially all of Europe\u2019s third quarter company operating margin decline.","Next I want to provide an update on some key financial items commodities, pricing and currencies. I\u2019ll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the quarter U.S. commodity cost rose 3% primarily due to higher beef and dairy prices. This pressure is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, our revised full year outlook for the U.S. basket of goods is an increase of 2.5% to 3%. Excluding currency, Europe\u2019s commodity costs were relatively flat for the third quarter.","We have reduced our full year outlook for Europe\u2019s grocery basket to reflect an increase of no more than 1% which implies relatively flat commodity cost for fourth quarter.","In terms of menu pricing, the U.S. is running about 2% at the end of September versus year-to-date food away from home inflation which stands at 2.5%. At 2%, our current pricing is notably lower than the 3% pricing level we were at in June. We felt it was important to bring our pricing more in line with food away from home so we did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off during third quarter. This pressured third quarter margins and we expected to continue into fourth quarter. As we\u2019ve said before, our preference is to keep pricing at or below food away from home index as we continue to balance the importance of driving guest counts with profitability.","Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment averaging about 2% year-over-year.","Foreign currency translation negatively impacted third quarter EPS by a $0.01. At current exchange rates, which reflect a stronger U.S. dollar, we expect a negative impact of fourth quarter EPS off $0.05 to $0.06 with a full year negative impact of $0.09 to $0.10. As usual, take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we move toward the end of the year.","Given these internal and external pressures we remain focused on those things within our control. At the top of the list is our overall spending. Starting with capital expenditures at the beginning of 2014, we announced the capital expenditures would be $2.9 billion to $3 billion for the year. In light of our recent performance and current market conditions we are proactively reducing this. Our 2014 spend will now be approximately $2.7 billion, which will be lower than our capital spend last year.","Through September we have opened about 750 new restaurants totally and expect to open about 1400 new restaurants this year fewer than the 1500 to 1600 originally planned. This reduction is driven primarily by fewer openings in markets like China in response to local market dynamics.","Earlier this year, we indicated we were scrutinizing our G&A spending. Internally, we refer to this initiative as resourcing for growth, a name that I think embodies the strategic intent of our process to identify key resources with the potential to be deployed more efficiently and effectively toward our critical growth drivers. For several months now we\u2019ve been working with third party experts to thoroughly analyze our cost structure in both our corporate and U.S. functions including our overall organization structure and staffing levels in order to fund key growth initiatives.","Based on our preliminary work we are targeting to identify and redirect nearly $100 million in savings for future long term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy and McDonald\u2019s experienced of the future. As we move forward, I do not expect a significant reduction in our total G&A expense but firmly believe that we are taking appropriate and prudent actions for the long term. We are balancing the need to curtail spending in certain areas in light of the present situation while remaining committed to funding our more significant growth opportunities. We expect to share more perspective on our 2015 G&A outlook in connection with our fourth quarter call in January.","As many of you have noted the McDonald\u2019s business model and structure is somewhat differentiated in the restaurant industry. In our wholly-owned markets, which represent over 27000 restaurants, McDonald\u2019s is the landlord and the franchisor. This secures long term tenure at our locations and allows us to make real estate and franchising decisions separately. We are co-investing with our franchisees in the overall success of the business. Accordingly, alignment is critical and our model is built on a highly collaborative approach which includes engagement with franchisees who operate 81% of our restaurants.","This approach also requires more time and resources both of which we believe result in better long term decisions that benefit both our system and our shareholders. We also believe that this partnership type approach has ultimately resulted in a superior and stable group of franchisees who generate industry leading average unit volumes and cash flows in virtually all the market in which we compete.","The business model has also served our shareholders well over time with our stock generating total shareholder returns that have exceeded both the Dow and the S&P not only for the last 10 years but over the last 25 years as well. While McDonald's total shareholder return has lagged the broader markets the last couple of years, we are confident that the actions we are taking in both the near and long-term will position us to continue to deliver significant shareholder returns.","We will continue to consider new opportunity to enhance both short and long-term value. Above all else, we seek to balance the needs of all stakeholders from our shareholders to our franchisees to the broader McDonald\u2019s system. We use it as a critical screen for all decisions, because that has been the key our enduring profitable growth throughout our history and will continue to be going forward.","Even with softer performance, the McDonald's business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. During the first nine months of 2014, McDonald's generated $6.2 billion of operating income, raised the quarterly dividend 5% to $0.85 per share and returned $4.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's current three year cash return target of $18 billion to $20 billion is a testament to our ongoing commitment to built long-term shareholder value.","As we enter fourth quarter and prepare our plans for 2015, we recognized that improved results won't happen overnight.","Let me share with you our current view on how 2014 will close out. While our underlying goal is to change the trajectory of our financial performance, our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure on the business in the near-term. Given the nature of the factors that I discussed, which are impacting our global business, we expect top and bottom-line performance to remain pressured in fourth quarter with comparable sales expected to be negative in October. Let me assure you that there is an acute understanding of the situation along with a strong sense of urgency to take the necessary steps to address our current challenges. Hopefully, you heard some of that on the call today.","We are confident that the work being done by our teams around the world will yield sustained profitable growth in the long-term. We have faced numerous challenges throughout our history and have always managed through these cycles. If you could travel the world and visit our franchisees and our restaurant teams, you would share our confidence that we will manage through these latest challenges as well. It all comes back to the strength of our brand, our business model and our approach to investing and growing the business over the long-term.","Our North Star continues to be the customer in better delivering on their needs. Since our founding in 1955, that has been the key to our growth and profitability. Thanks.","Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Chris Stent","Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analysts and investor questions.","(Operator Instructions).","The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","Thank you. As it relate to your U.S. performance, I believe the comp underperformed the industry by a little over 500 basis points in both July and August. And I was wondering if you could provide what that gap to the industry looked like in September?","Don Thompson","Hey, Brian, this is Don. Yes, our comp gap in the month of September was a little over 600 basis points, so a 6.3%.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you. A couple questions, if I can. So you\u2019re talking about a couple of changes in the U.S., a simplified menu effective in January and then three markets where you have either more extensive Create Your Own experience changes. Could you talk about what a customer in the U.S. restaurant is going to see broadly I would assume in January from a simplified menu? And then, what they are going to see and experience in those three markets that I think you are targeting for the third quarter? And then, just one financial question. Pete, the CapEx coming down make sense I think. How much more room is there for 2015 in terms of that CapEx number coming down more significantly?","Don Thompson","Hey Joe. First of all, relative to consumers in the U.S. in 2015, they will see several different things. And I'll try to talk about a few of those. One, is because we are moving to more regionalize local windows again, which is a strength of the McDonald system, and we have moved away from that. They will see more regional products throughout the U.S. We have about 21 regions. We have over 150 odd cooperatives across the United States and so those markets will get to pull down from shelf promotions. And they can pull down from some of the broader menu pipeline offerings that we have. So customers will begin to see that again and there will be a stronger balance between the regional markets and then the national base marketing.","As you may recall, the regional markets typically will focus on offerings and promotions, the national markets will focus on the quality, the brand McDonald, what we are talking about relative to our people in larger events. So that's one major change that you will begin to see and customers will see.","The second one is going to be how we engage in conversation with our customers through both social and traditional medium. So this is going to be something that's more felt and heard relative to dialog than it's just basically seen. With the launch of Our food Your questions is a great example of that and that is a platform we will leverage across the year. You will see initial expansion of the experience in the future in those three markets that we talked about. Experience of the future is much more than just Create Your Taste, it is a broader service experience, it is a broader digitally engaged, if you would, mobilily engaged experience in the restaurants. And some of you may have seen that relative some of our markets like France or what's taking place in Australia.","Also, we will be launching the mobile app, the global app. In the U.S., it will include promotional offers, also some mobile payment opportunities such as Apple Pay and also some things possibly with our e-Arch Card.","And the last piece would be some of the markets may see some of the testing that would go on relative the various pricing structures that had been a balance pricing relationships across the entire menu board. So these are some of the things that will be out and about in the marketplace. And I\u2019m sure our customers will give us appropriate feedback. But we look aggressively to get these things moving.","Pete Benson","And Joe its Pete. Regarding the CapEx question, a significant majority of this year's reduction was due to a reduction in openings. And we are frankly scrubbing the pipeline and there is probably opportunity for that new opening number to go down a little bit more next year. What we are going to continue to investigate as we move to finalizing the plans over the next month to six weeks, is what is the level of reinvestment spending that we\u2019re going to need around the experience of the future and some of these initiatives. So when we get back together in January, we\u2019ll be able to give you more specific guidance not only on total capital but how that splits between new units and reinvestment.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco at Buckingham","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham","Thank you. I guess Pete, can you just talk about how may be in context the recent struggles globally, especially in APNEA may have impacted some of the things I think that people have also discussed or debated with you somehow opportunities possibly to refranchise take that 81% global number higher as well as maybe even divesting some businesses like Japan, is there any impact to the valuation of what we might get from those of the cash proceeds? Given the near term struggles if you can give us any sort of color on that or does that sort of push down and kick the can down the road a little longer on maybe being able to see some of those monetization of that?","Pete Benson","Yes, Matt, for this year-to-date we\u2019ve refranchised a little over 300 restaurants compared to about 225 a year ago. So we were starting to see a nice uptick in the activity, and 90% that refranchising this year was in our focus areas of Europe and APMEA. As you point out -- and a big bulk of those were in China. And so as you point out with the supplier ratio over there, our activities are probably delayed slightly, but I don\u2019t think dramatically because this is a temporary event. It will return to normal and the business model is still attractive and still franchisable. So while it may be slightly delayed, we don't see it having a significant impact in either our timing or our ability to extract value from those refranchising transactions.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan at Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thank you, good morning. On the technology front, I think I heard you say you are bringing some new technologies to U.S .markets. Can you talk about how you chose them and if they\u2019re giving a full suite of offerings or is it going to be kind of a layered approach? And then just a follow up on a number or comment around APMEA in saying it takes six to nine months potentially to get to a normalized level. Could you define that is normalized less negative or positive? Thank you.","Don Thompson","Hi Nicole, I talk a little bit first about the digital piece and then we can talk about the recovery efforts over in China specifically. Relative to digital, as you may recall, Nicole, a couple of years we began to focus quite intently on our digital efforts, and we have done several things. One is that we move forward to be able to bring in appropriate talent to support our digital effort. So we brought in Atif Rafiq, who had a tremendous background in the tech sector and more specifically with Amazon.","We also have been hiring quite a few digital leads around the world from world class organizations. And to that point we actually opened up our first digital office at San Francisco near Silicon Valley to continue to be able to recruit and bring in talent. That is a critical aspect of how we select the applications and the platforms with which we move forward.","We also have several markets around the world that had a jump start relative to some of the mobile applications such as France with mobile pay and actually some promotional offers. ","So we have leveraged that. We did a major test in Australia to look at the actual global application what we call the global app, which is built upon our new path technology system and allows us to continue to add on different applications to support various needs from pay and order to other things such as music. We\u2019ve talked about those in the past. That global app will be launched in 2015 with some of the promotional offers in the U.S. and we will continue expanding the already established mobile applications that we have in some of the markets outside of the US. So we are pretty excited about those.","We are also excited about the relationship that we have begun to cultivate the most recent of which was Apple Pay and we\u2019re the only restaurant, as I mentioned, that will be able to allow consumers to leverage Apple Pay in the drive-through. And so and one of the only restaurant businesses that Apple has had a strategic partnership with. So that is the beginning of some of the things that we are doing; there are more things that we have in the pipeline.","Relative to the recovery in China, when we assess the six to nine months we work with the local markets and we look at their timeline, there are several things that have been done there. First of all in China, we had to make sure that we can solidify the supply chain. As I mentioned the folks did an aggressive job, a great job aggressively of being able to really reallocate our supply chain in 60 days to ensure we can get China and Japan back up.","We also wanted to make sure that relative to anything that has taken place in that market there are food safety processes procedures was robust as they should be and as we wanted them to be. We have hired outside food safety auditors to support those, the things that we do in that regard along with additional training of our employees.","So those things do take a look at more time. And then once we got supply back in the market place we began and launched our brand trust campaign which is a holistic brand recovery campaign focused on bringing customers back into the restaurant. As you know, in China, if there is an incident such as avian influenza or food scare or food quality scare it does take a while for customer to come back to any restaurant establishment. So that's how we have worked with our local market and some of the things that we have been doing and again we assessed it at six to nine more months before we see recovery.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird","Hi, Good morning. My question for Don on the overall strategy. I guess one of the hallmarks the way I understand it of McDonald's is the speed and consistency of the operations ,and I think you have highlighted some struggles on that front this year, and I just wanted to get an update on your progress on improving your operations. And then secondly, I think a lot of the initiatives you are talking about the experience of the future, sound like they might be adding more complexity to the system. So everything from localization to create your own taste. So I am just wondering if you could comment on your confidence level on being able to execute that that added complexity, if you will?","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question, David. First of all you know anything that we would implement in an restaurant we have taken it require a bit of testing. So relative to create your case has been through the innovation lab, the innovation center and the testing protocols there it has been in a restaurant near the innovation center, we moved it out to Lagoona, we had had testing outside of the U.S. in some of the markets and now as we move forward in Australia, what they are really doing is the soft, the front side of the role out in the Australian market. And so we know that from an operational perspective we are able and capable of delivering this experience in the restaurant enabled by the technology advancements and the point of sale platform that we put into the restaurant. So on the operational side they are relative to Create Your Taste, we built very, very strongly that that is doable.","We know it is based upon what we have done already relative to basic simplification of the restaurant and rating ourselves for things like Create Your Taste and for basic customer satisfaction at higher level. In markets like the U.S. they been through what they call an operations reset. That operations reset combined with the minimum simplification efforts that our aimed at reducing complexity of low volume items. That's an important part. The complexity of low volume items are the things that we\u2019re looking to simply and remove from the restaurants. When we do that we enable ourselves to be able to then pull down additional products that we can flow through our operating system in the U.S.","Now, one of the things that I would also add here is when you look at some of the things that we are looking to do in terms of products, those products are actually made easier based upon some of the investments we made whether they be the point of sale system or may be things like the high density kitchen where we have more condiments that we are able to make relative to putting those things inside the Made for You cooking system. So the Made for You system, simplification of some of the items and our focus on operations are the reason that we have high confidence in Create Your Taste relative to the in store capability.","The other thing that I mentioned at this point and some of you already know this, Create Your Taste is an in store execution as we began. That is the way that we are delivering on that expectation and experience in the restaurant. Customers seem to really really -- it appeals the customers in a great way and will continue doing that. We have a different solution that we are work on relative to the drive-through.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays","Great. Thank you very much. So a question on the U.S. business. I know in the press release and in your comments earlier you made -- mentioned I think that the issue at least from a sales perspective is more sustained, competitive activity I know over the past year or two. I think that was more down played, I think was more you guys in the management believe and that it was more self-inflicted, less about what these more peers might be doing. But maybe just in terms of that change in view, like what have the sandwich competitors done most recently that might have negatively impacting McDonald\u2019s? And how much credit maybe do you give to the strength of whether it's just casual or whether it's the consumer push into better quality, healthy offerings? I mean, just seems like there is a confluence of factors that sound which might be now out of your control relative to self-inflicted. Any thoughts on that would be great.","Don Thompson","Hey Jeff. We -- one thing we do not do too often, Jeff, and you probably won\u2019t hear us do too often, and that\u2019s talk about for fact that our focus is now on competitive pressure. What we do is acknowledge it; they\u2019re folks in the marketplace that are doing some solid things. I would still hold true to the fact that our biggest challenge is what we do at McDonald\u2019s and how we move forward. Do we have the aggressiveness in the local markets, have we allowed the aggressiveness in local markets or have we been a little bit more focused on an aligned national platform, which doesn\u2019t leverage that local relevance. And if I look that, the local GRPs that I then assign against those local relevance products as they are putting for those in their local windows in the markets, we have not been as strong as we need to be. And I think that is one of the areas relative to our menu that you guys haven't seen and many of you have asked questions about. What is in the menu pipeline?","I think you'll get a broader chance to see that as the local markets, as we get back to what we've historically done with local markets. Allow them to pull down products that are relevant in their markets and to drive those aggressively. And so, we are going to do that.","Notwithstanding competitors that are there, competitors have always been in the marketplace. It can't be used as an excuse for us. What it is is an opportunity for us to build our business by taking back some of those folks who are visiting others right now.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","Yes. Thanks guys. I wonder if you could touch a little bit more on the U.S. trends. In September in particular, what you would credit that slow down to, despite the interest you're picking up little bit? And if also you could speak the different day for us, such as breakfast where you did giveaway some coffee and then lunch and dinner where it seems like competition is both picking up on the value and premium end? If there is much difference in sales growth or declines, I needed those (inaudible)?","Pete Bensen","Will, so a couple of things. This year, as you just mentioned, in the U.S. system they focused on coffee and also there was NFL promotion. Last year, it was comping against wings, which do drive a higher average check in sales. While not as successful as we wanted wings to be last year. but by most measures it was still a solid promotion relative to going up against the NFL promotion and coffee. So those two things did not deliver at the same rate, while we were able to sample quite a bit of coffee. And our breakfast business overall is up on the year and continues to be up.","The challenge that we have had is that it has to be about more than breakfast. So when you look at that balance -- and I just talked about local markets, we have got to focus on that breakfast and coffee aspect, as well as focusing on larger sandwiches, which enhance and increase that average check. And so that was one of the gaps that -- the biggest gap I would say that we had in the month of September. What we comped up against and also the fact that our promotional efforts were more sample based in terms of driving coffee than they were more of a breakfast building base just for that particular month. And I know that the U.S. system understands and realizes that as we move forward.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Hey guys. Just wondering more near-term and then 2015 kind of the extent of the McOpCo margin decline kind of Q4 versus 3Q? And then, I know its early, but how are you guys thinking about what you need to start to drive those McOpCo margins back higher, whether its comps or the commodity environment for 2015?","Don Thompson","Andy, good question. For 2014, as we kind of -- as I indicated in my remarks, we see continued pressure in the fourth quarter. Reflecting on the factors that were impacting the third quarter right, U.S. the biggest factor driving the U.S. decline vis-a-vis the decline in the second quarter was less pricing. And so, we would expect less pricing to still be a factor in the fourth quarter, as well as the 3% commodity increase. Those were the two biggest factors driving this quarter. And thus, we see it now will impact the fourth quarter as well.","In Europe, virtually a 100% of the decline was in Russia -- was due to Russia and Ukraine. 75% of that was Russia, the rest was the Ukraine. With the relatively favorable commodity environment over there, a lot of the other markets were doing fairly well on their margins actually. UK was driving it and Germany continued to be the biggest drag on the McOpCo margins outside the Ukraine and Russia for Europe. And it\u2019s too early to give a picture on 2015. But as you point out, driving comps, our McOpCo margins are really a top-line gain and driving comp sales is going to be the biggest key to getting that going again.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Thanks. I did hear your comments on minor reductions for future developments. But why do you believe only a minor reduction is appropriate? And I guess, what you mean by that is just going back to what other timeframe was, the early 2000s U.S. (inaudible) sales were soft, you guys were losing shares. And I think it was in the early 2000, 2002, 2003 along those lines, you dramatically, dramatically got new development and then, within couple years life got better and realize that it's not all cause and effect, it\u2019s not that simple. But again, just sort of thinking bigger picture here, what's the hesitation in pursuing your better is not bigger strategy in 2016 and beyond? Why don't you think that would not work again?","Don Thompson","Hey Jeff, this is Don. And I ask Pete to comment as well. Let me just draw a little distinction here. Relative to what happened in the early 2000s, that development was taking place primarily in the U.S. business. So when we were -- in the U.S. business, we were trying to grow via development and that development was being driven across the market. We were not as sophisticated as we are in site selection. It was more based upon basically new unit movement or new unit sales, and that is not the appropriate formula. So today, if I look at where we are growing, that gives us some confidence relative to how we are growing, at what pace. When you're developing into markets like the Chinas of the world, the Indias of the world, some of the other markets across Europe and Asia, Korea, then those markets have yielded some more solid returns. And so, I just want to draw a little distinction. This is a very different approach. We have much high levels of site selection capability than we did then and it is not a concentrated and focused growth like it was in the U.S., it's a much more diverse portfolio.","Pete Bensen","Yes. And Jeff, I just add a couple of points. One, the starting point is dramatically different from 2002. I mean, we are starting from a much higher position of average unit volumes. And actually, our new store returns are doing fairly well. So as I said earlier to Andy, comps are the key to getting the margins and the profitability going again around the fringes. Turning a 100 or two openings up the portfolio for year is not going to have a dramatic impact. And in fact, the down point, our site selection capabilities are too old, the number of markets we are growing in is much more expanded than it was a little more than 10 years ago. So we feel it\u2019s appropriate to skim back a little bit, but for the long-term perspective and growth of the business we are going to continue to open a units where it makes sense and where we are going to get good returns. ","Chris Stent","Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.","Keith Siegner - UBS","Thanks. Pete, of the over $200 million year-over-year reduction, APMEA operating profit dollars, how much of that reduction came from the loss of sales and the deleverage effect versus how much came from may be more discrete items like inventory write off as you throughout put (inaudible) or anything else that might be one time? If you could give us some color on those two pieces that would be very helpful. Thanks.","Pete Bensen","Yes, Keith, at the operation income level the China supplier issue that $0.15 translated into about $180 million of operating income decline. Roughly half of that was McOpCo margins. So that I would argue was that clearly was sales driven. Then the next biggest peach was our lower earnings pick up from our joint ventures notably Japan and while that had a little bit of inventory write off and some other costs, that result would also mostly sales driven along with royalty some franchisee support and then finally there were probably about $20 million that was truly inventory write off and an additional supply chain cost to get that supply back on par in China and Hong Kong.","Chris Stent","The next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. It\u2019s just two kind of related questions. The first one is the overarching concern I sometimes hear is that McDonald's is struggling to resonate with millennial consumers, in particularly in the U.S. And so I was wondering if you could talk about the two strategies that I think you might be most targeted to that group and whether you are starting to see any initial signs that you are getting traction? And those are -- and my interpretation would be the sort of digital social media and then also the our food your questions and just whether or not that strategy is working because it sounds like you are not actually changing recipes in response to concerns, you just change kind of explain and alleviate some of those concerns. So if you just talk realistically about kind of the millennial question?","Don Thompson","Thanks Sarah. The real point, so let me just broadly relative to millennial. If you look at the quick service restraint industry there is a decline relative to millennial usages of the quick service restaurant industry. I think that as we look at it as McDonald's what we believe that we are able to do is to appeal to some of those customers and clearly come into our business. And so as we look at it and I should say appeal to more of those customers and customers use our business now but appeal to more of the millennials. But it is a much broader aspect in the millennial. Our Food Your Question is about creating a dialog. It is not about a one question answer kind of a piece. Usually there is a back and forth relative to ingredients, platforms, integrity, sources in terms of where our food comes from. It may be relative to social responsibility. What we are doing relative to deforestation. So there are a number of questions that come up and it is about engaging in a dialog.","We want to make sure that we are a transparent brand. There are a lot of misperceptions out here relative to our food and what we want to do is make sure that we at least provide an opportunity for people to directly ask those questions. So this for us is just a way for us to better build this brand and tell the truth about McDonald's and our supply chain which is absolutely fabulous. And so that it the intent there.","On the digital front, we believe that digital, mobile technologies, kiosk related ordering the opportunities to be able to allow customers choice in their McDonald's experience is good for all of our customers. We think that there may be a skew clearly to a millennial, that would be probably and even stronger skew towards those that are younger than millennials, but as we move forward that is one of the things that we would be able to better define. We do know that the experience of the future resonates well with our customers around the world.","Chris Stent","We have four more questions. So we will take those. First David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer - RBC","Thanks. Just a follow up on that, the millennial issue has been well documented but I guess we should keep in perspective that the U.S. factory comps are up, I think around 2% lately. So do you believe that there is more of millennial issue with McDonald's and that's the differentiator and I suspect that you in your own self assessment see some other key differences there resulting in the widening gap to the industry and what you think those are? Thanks.","Don Thompson","David, I believe that relative to the comp gap, so I think the comp gap is a combination of several things, some things relative to what we are conveying out there relative to what others are conveying in terms of the menu offerings. I think that is one of the challenges. I think it is also about the value that we are offering or not offering and that is another aspect of the comp gap. If you look at some of those changes, the question is whether or not our value and our food options are resonating as strongly and so I believe that that is the fundamental basis of some of the challenges that we are having.","Having said that one of the ways that we best address that is by ensuring that the local markets have the opportunity to move forward to products and the offerings that will resonate locally. When I say resonate locally that means resonate across the demographics of those local areas. So that is everything from millennials all the way up to those that are more mature in the marketplace that are coming to visit McDonald\u2019s or other (inaudible).","So what we want to make sure we do is have the right food, the experience is right and we\u2019re engaging customers to be able to have their choice and a great McDonald\u2019s experience with great food quality and great service and a clean environment as we always done and at an affordable price. When we\u2019re able to do that at McDonald\u2019s we\u2019ll be fine within the marketplace in terms of generating sales. The broader opportunity is to be even more relevant relative to the digital experience, the restaurant of the future and the customization opportunities for our food, and that\u2019s what you heard us talk a little bit about today.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I wanted to go back, Pete, to the G&A question and why you\u2019re not seeing or don\u2019t think you can actually get net positive reduction in G&A? Your G&A runs higher substantially higher at least on a per store basis than your peers and I understand you got more complexity but you\u2019ve also got better scale. So I guess just two questions, you can respond to that but two questions I guess around. One, what is the chance you actually you will be able to see a net reduction in absolute G&A in \u201915, not how much but just can you do that? And secondly, maybe help us understand the $2.5 billion in SG&A how much is actually G&A and how much is corporate versus what\u2019s in the fields or in the divisions?","Pete Bensen","Hey, John. As we talked about from the very beginning when we start talking about this scrutiny of the G&A, we believe that there are significant opportunities to grow this business by investing in the digital strategy and this McDonald\u2019s experience in the future, and so smarter for us we think to redirect resources to that. And as I indicated, we believe we\u2019re targeting about $100 million from U.S. in core to repurpose, if you will, or redirect to those initiatives.","And we believe over time we\u2019ve continued, we always look at ways to be efficient and more effective with our spend. If we thought minus three was our trend line for the next couple of years you\u2019d be hearing a more dramatic cut and taking cost out of this business, because that would be the only way to continue to grow profitability if we saw that was a permanent change to our revenue stream. But we don\u2019t believe cutting our way to prosperity is going to be helpful for the long term of this business and smarter for us we think to redirect these savings into these growth opportunity that Don outlined.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Howard Penney of Hedgeye.","Howard Penney - Hedgeye","Thanks very much. Last night the CEO of Chipotle spent 10 minutes of his opening comments on his conference call basically attacking the legacy QSR operators with business models and I could just paraphrase as being broken, given the type of food they serve. And if I broaden those comments out to what CEOs of supermarkets like (inaudible) telling about more customers coming into the natural all natural organic GMO free products. is Mr. Ells first of all and the lot of things that you talked about today I can appreciate the need for the technology but it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re really going in the direction where consumers are going. So just curious as to you think that Mr. Ells justified in his comment the legacy (inaudible) operators which I assume he included you in that comment. Thank you.","Don Thompson","Hi, Howard, thanks for the question. Howard, we believe that if you look at the broader market and you look at what customers are asking for, they are asking for transparency they\u2019re asking to know what\u2019s in the food, they\u2019re asking for integrity of the food. There are cases and there are markets where organics are drivers at a higher level. But I would offer is that the highest level is more about their transparency, integrity and also the ability to customize and have what they want on a sandwich or a burger.","I think it is what has given rise to so many very small but quite a few burger openings, specialty burger house openings. And so there is still quite a resonance relative to food, there is a big resonance relative to how I can customize. There is an appeal and you\u2019ll see us in some categories looking to different products possibly organics we actually are doing it in certain markets. But I would it\u2019s not the main driver if you would, we\u2019re at the main drive but I mean we wouldn\u2019t have the clearly the number of customers that we have today visiting the McDonald\u2019s restaurant.","I will never say that someone else particularly (inaudible). I know Steve I use to visit his first restaurant when we entered into an initial partnership back then when we were sharing the McDonald\u2019s supply chain system which helped him as he move forward Chipotle. But I would not say Steve is wrong or right, I think each individual organization has to look at that and look at it through the eyes of the customers and what customers are asking them to deliver. And so I think you\u2019ll see a lot of changes though, Howard, I mean if these things become even more large, even more trendy then that something clearly we\u2019ll look even more aggressively at. But we do have markets around the world that focus more on organics we have markets that focus more on locally relevant products. France just finished up one of their launches and it was basically speaking about French beef; we talk about Australian beef over in Australia. In the U.S., I think we have some additional opportunities to talk about the fact that the vast majority of our food at McDonald\u2019s in the U.S. is produced right here in the U.S. so we have some opportunities to talk about that in the U.S. a little bit more.","Chris Stent","Our last question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Great, thank you so much. Don, my perception is been that your previous health and wellness movement, and I am not talking about just organic but just health and wellness in general, but previously \u201880s and the \u201890s were driven from an older and drastic and maybe what\u2019s different now is that the movement is being driven by younger demographic that's in younger demographic that according to your own data that you don\u2019t have the appeal to as may be you did to that same age cohort 10 or 20 years ago. I mean - you haven\u2019t even mention the words for McDonald\u2019s about health and wellness and just what kind of an opportunity that you would have and if I can ask the question directly I mean why is that really front n centre in terms of lot of the product development work that we\u2019re talking about today?","Don Thompson","Great question, John, and actually it is. Health and wellness defined by many of the customers that we talk to coming to McDonald\u2019s were visiting the informal eating out industry. And that's a big point those that actually visit the industry and buy food from the industry. We - its translated into real and fresh in many cases, and that has been a major driver of our strategies as we move forward. Customers want real food and they want to make sure they understand that its real food and they want fresh food. So they want to understand the sources or the origin, they want to make sure that I know what\u2019s it, where it came from and the integrity of those sources.","And so what we\u2019re trying to do is more visually depict that both in our marketing, in our foods of question and even more importantly at the important movement of truth which is in the restaurants and for those of you visit our restaurants and been behind the counters you\u2019re seeing the freshness and the quality of our produce. However ,not everyone has done and seen that and so we want to make sure that we\u2019re transparent enough to do that many times real and fresh is also conveyed. If you look at it relative to those products those offerings that are selling the most it\u2019s based upon the component make up of the food itself.","So it may be differences in cheeses, differences in sauces all of these things either things that make up a great tasting burger or sandwich we\u2019re offering today. And so this is a direction that we\u2019re moving in and we\u2019ll continue to stay close John with our customers relative to what it is they want and what it is that they want to see because we can deliver that as a McDonald\u2019s system.","Chris Stent","That concludes our Q&A. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Don who has a few closing comments.","Don Thompson","First of all, thanks for your participation this morning as we wrap up the call I really appreciate again all of you joining us. We have a clear plan to regain momentum in the U.S. and I think you\u2019ve heard that and we want to regain momentum around the world as we aggressively advance programs and initiatives that are designed to deliver more relevant experiences and as we bring the McDonald\u2019s experience to the future to our customers even faster. We\u2019re ready to drive our business forward by creating real and noticeable changes for our customers and partnership with our tremendous system of franchises supplier partners and company employees.","Our actions are intention and they strategically address what customers want from us today. They\u2019re based in the insights that we have gained from the marketplaces and they\u2019re based in what customers will expect tomorrow. I'm excited about the work that we\u2019re doing and I'm confident we will achieve our goals. I just wish you all a great day and a great weekend.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations from McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","Last month, we provided unaudited summary financial information and historical segment data consistent with the company\u2019s new structure. The updated annual information was provided for 2010 through 2014. Quarterly details were also provided for 2014 through June 2015. Specific questions related to this summary financial information and historical segment data will be addressed by the Investor Relations team through a frequently asked questions document that will be distributed on October 30. Given the very limited number of questions received, we are no longer planning to host a separate conference call to discuss this information.","And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s been 8 months since I stepped into the position of CEO. Since then, we have made meaningful progress to fuel our turnarounds and begin repositioning McDonald\u2019s as a modern progressive burger company.","Our turnaround is operationally led. It\u2019s grounded in running great restaurants, which is the first step to enhancing the customer experience. People have more choices than ever about where to dine. We want to give them more reasons to dine in McDonald\u2019s by recommitting to hot fresh food, cost friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald\u2019s.","Our number one priority is to return critical markets to sustainable revenue and income growth. To do so, we must be customer centric in our planning and our decision-making. We must have the best talent in the most critical positions. And our system must be aligned around the actions we are taking to consistently run great restaurants. And we must execute initiatives that ultimately enhance our appeal in the areas that matter most to consumers, to great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value.","Whilst we are still in the early phases, our turnaround plan is working. Customers are beginning to respond to the actions we are taking and this progress is reflected in our third quarter results. As we have discussed previously, the U.S. and international lead market segments generate over 80% of global operating income. For third quarter, five of our six most significant markets drove positive comparable sales growth with France\u2019s comparable sales being marginally negative. We also grew consolidated margins, operating income and earnings per share on a constant currency basis. These results do, in part, reflect the benefits from comparisons to the 2014 China supplier issue and the prior year\u2019s increasing tax reserves. However, operating results for the quarter were still up modestly when you exclude these items and take into consideration the significant currency headwinds.","Looking ahead, as we begin fourth quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be positive in all segments. Every market face a significant role in our global turnaround. Some markets like Canada, Australia and the UK are further along. They continue to deliver strong, sustained growth. That said, all markets have adjusted how they think and how they operate to ensure their actions and decisions are grounded in satisfying customers in their local markets today and for the long-term.","The U.S. business remains front and center given its fundamental importance to overall consolidated results. Its shift to positive comparable sales in the third quarter, the first quarterly comparable sales increase in the U.S. in two years is a tangible sign of the progress and reflects the initial steps we have taken in areas that matter most to our customers: great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value. In the area of food, we have made progress toward enhancing the taste of our products and improving consumer perceptions of quality. Our core classics define the McDonald\u2019s brand. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve enhanced operational procedures. We are toasting buns longer, changing how we sear and grill burger patties to bring out the best in our menu and serve hotter, juicier sandwiches to our customers. We transition back to the original recipe for our Egg McMuffin, using butter instead of margarine to deliver an even tastier sandwich. Customers appreciated the change and we saw a double-digit increase in the number of Egg McMuffins sold immediately following the rollout.","In August, we introduced the buttermilk chicken sandwich made with 100% chicken breast meat and real buttermilk. This new product complements our ongoing core menu emphasis and customers have responded favorably. Initial results have exceeded the high end of our expectations. And at the start of the fourth quarter, we rolled out all-day breakfast across the U.S. Customers have been asking for this for years and we\u2019ve challenged ourselves to move past legacy barriers to deliver and we did. Our ability to move from one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants, speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system have been customer led in our decisions and our actions.","We have also taken action to enhance our convenience and the overall customer experience. Early this year, we implemented operational procedures designed to improve order accuracy, remove some items in the menu and simplified the drive-through menu boards. Our goal is net simplification. We have established screens to evaluate operational complexity versus the expected impact on the customer and the business. And ultimately, we want to focus our efforts on fewer, bigger decisions that generate bigger rewards. We also took a first step toward enhancing the customer experience digitally with the deployment of the mobile application. To-date, there have been over 2 million downloads of the app and 1.5 million offers redeemed. We will begin national advertising later this month.","Now, from a value standpoint, we are aligned lined with franchisees on the need for national value. The summer $2.50 Double Cheeseburger and Small Fry promotion was the first step. And we remain committed with operators in working towards restoring more permanent national value platforms in the future. Customers are noticing the differences. Our customer feedback system, which now tracks approximately 10 million customer touch points each year, reflects consistent improvement in customer feedback scores. We are seeing this across all key categories measured, with the most significant improvement seen in the areas we focused on namely, food quality, friendly and fast service and order accuracy.","Let\u2019s now turn to the international lead markets segment starting with Australia. Third quarter marks four consecutive quarters of comparable sales and guest counts in Australia. The market turnaround began last year as the customers responded to the combined initiatives that collectively improved our overall experience. This included a renewed focus on improving operations, the added convenience of offering Barista crafted McCaf\u00e9 beverages through the drive-through and the stronger value platform with the re-launch of the Loose Change menu. This year, we have been giving customers even more reasons to visit our restaurants with the rollout of a new Value Menu of breakfast and through effective marketing and promotional efforts, including monopoly.","National advertising of the Experience the Future, which includes self-order kiosks, digital menu boards, table service, and burger customization through Create Your Taste began July 1. While early, we are encouraged with the initial results and the positive buzz we have created in the market. And we\u2019re fueling that energy as we add chicken and salad offerings to the Create Your Taste platform later this month.","Let\u2019s now turn to Germany, a market showing early signs of a turnaround. Customers are responding to the steps we have taken to enhance the appeal of premium products by emphasizing the provenance and sustainability of ingredients. The new clubhouse veggie sandwich in August, along with a re-hit of a proven customer favorite [indiscernible] contributed to positive comparable sales in the third quarter. And this month\u2019s launch of the McB, a premium burger that\u2019s made with 100% organic beef from farms in Germany and Austria reinforces food quality message to our customers.","In France, we continue to maintain share despite the challenging macro environment and in a formal eating out market experiencing its fourth consecutive year of decline. Customers appreciate the actions we have taken to strengthen value at every price tier. This includes introducing McFirst earlier this year, a three item meal combination for under \u20ac5 and extending Petit plaisir across more product categories and dayparts.","In addition, strong marketing campaigns including the Grand Premium and the American summer food events have successfully driven premium sandwich sales. We are also elevating the service experience by providing customers with new ways to order and be served in our restaurants. Self-order kiosks are now in more than 90% of French restaurants and we are now offering table service in more than half. Strong performance continues in the UK and Canada. These two market\u2019s ability to sustain prolonged growth is a direct result of their robust planning process, which directly links actions to the specific consumer needs. Strong quality campaigns in both markets are boosting customer perceptions of core classics and successful promotions, a new menu in use like the Chicken Legend in the UK and the new Mighty Angus in Canada have driven growth in premium products.","Since Russia and China are two high growth markets of particular interest, let\u2019s spend a moment on them. Both markets posted positive comparable sales from the quarter as they recover from last year\u2019s well-documented issues. The team\u2019s execution against strong recovery plans with a comprehensive focus around great tasting, high quality food, convenience and value has successfully restored brand trust scores in both markets. However, we face near-term headwinds given an economic slowdown in China and continued volatility in Russia.","In addition to the operational elements of the turnaround plan, each market is executing around the globe, we continue a regular cadence of meaningful moves consistent with the leadership brand. We believe these moves will ultimately improve consumer perceptions of our brand. In September, we announced our plans in the U.S. to transition to cage free eggs over the next 10 years. More recently, we collaborated with a number of global brand leaders to raise awareness for the plight of refugees and the need to support the United Nation\u2019s World Food Program. And earlier this week, we announced our participation in the White House Climate Pledge.","Turning around our business requires a relentless focus on what consumers want and expect from McDonald's. Our responsibility is to give them reasons to feel good about visiting time and again. Our opportunity is to differentiate McDonald's while delivering what consumers want today, while laying the foundation for what they would expect tomorrow and our commitment is to deliver on both. I am pleased with the progress we have made and remain confident in the ability of our talented system of franchisees, employees and suppliers to revitalize our connection with customers as we execute our turnaround plan into 2016.","Thank you. And I will now hand it over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Steve and hello, everyone. Today\u2019s earnings release marks our first quarterly reporting under the new segment structure. So I want to spend a few minutes outlining the new segments as a lead-in to my discussion of the factors that impacted the company\u2019s third quarter performance. Effective July 1, we completed an important first step in the company\u2019s global turnaround plan, the reorganization of our business from a geographically focused structure to segments that combine markets with similar characteristics and opportunities for growth. Our reporting segments now include the U.S., our largest individual market accounting for over 40% of consolidated operating income, the international lead segment, which includes our established markets of Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK that collectively account for about 40% of the company\u2019s operating income; the high-growth segment, which includes markets with relatively higher restaurant expansion and franchising potential, including China, Italy, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, these markets account for about 10% of the company\u2019s operating income and the foundational and corporate segment that encompasses the remaining markets. Each of which has the potential to operate under a largely franchised model. These markets are combined with corporate activities for reporting purposes.","From a business operation standpoint, this new structure brings similar markets together to leverage their collective insights and expertise to deliver a better overall experience for our customers. From a reporting standpoint, the new structure provides greater visibility into the key markets driving the vast majority of the company\u2019s underlying financial performance. So let\u2019s take a look at the major drivers of our third quarter results.","Earnings per share for the quarter increased $0.31 to $1.40. In constant currencies, third quarter earnings per share increased $0.48. These results benefited from the comparison against prior year results, which included an increase in our tax reserves and the China supplier issue. These items negatively impacted third quarter 2014 earnings per share by $0.41. Excluding the impact of the unusual prior year items, third quarter earnings per share would have increased $0.07 or 5% in constant currencies.","Looking beyond the unusual prior year items, third quarter global comparable sales were up 4% reflecting positive comparable sales across all segments and positive guest counts in all segments except the U.S. The international lead market segment was the largest contributor to the company\u2019s third quarter comparable sales performance, posting an increase of 4.6%, led by strong comparable sales and guest counts in Australia, the UK and Canada. Germany\u2019s results were uneven, but encouraging as the market posted positive comparable sales for the second consecutive quarter. And in France, comparable sales were marginally negative as the market\u2019s macroeconomic environment and informal eating out industry remained challenged. The high growth markets generated strong comparable sales of 8.9% for the quarter, reflecting sales recovery in both China and Russia. For perspective, China\u2019s comparable sales were up 26.8% for the quarter. The U.S. reported a comparable sales increase from 0.9% for the quarter, supported by the introduction of the new buttermilk crispy chicken sandwich and a return to the classic recipe for our Egg McMuffin. Comparable sales performance improved for the latter part of the quarter.","With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchised margins, which totaled $1.9 billion, a 7% increase in constant currencies for the quarter. The franchise margin percent increased 20 basis points to 82.2%, driven by the positive comparable sales generated by the international segments. Global company operated margin dollars increased 9% in constant currencies to $675 million for the quarter, while the company operated margin percent increased 10 basis points to 15.8%.","China\u2019s sales recovery accounted for the majority of the margin improvement for the quarter, partly offset by ongoing labor costs in the U.S. The incremental labor costs in the U.S. related primarily to our decision to invest in our people by raising wages and providing paid time off for employees at our company operated restaurants, as well as providing educational assistance to all eligible U.S. restaurant employees effective July 1. These costs, along with wage increase have mandated by several states during the first half of the year, impacted third quarter U.S. margins by about 400 basis points. For the quarter, U.S. commodity costs rose about 1%, primarily due to higher beef prices. Our U.S. third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2%, which remains below food away from home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food away from home inflation for the full year remains at 2% to 3%.","Commodity costs for the international lead markets segment were up about 0.5% in the quarter. While price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1% to 2%.","Moving down the P&L, G&A for the third quarter ended at $584 million, up 9% in constant currencies due entirely to higher incentive-based compensation accruals versus the prior year. Despite this unfavorable quarterly comparison, we are making progress against our previously announced savings target. Looking beyond the third quarter, currency translation is expected to be a headwind for the final quarter of 2015 as the U.S. dollar remained strong against nearly all of the world\u2019s other major currencies. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency translation to negatively impact fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.08 to $0.10. As usual, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout the quarter.","Before I conclude my remarks, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter, we typically provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing our financial results in an outlook section. In light of our upcoming November Investor Meeting, we did not provide an update on our financial outlook in either today\u2019s prepared remarks or as part of today\u2019s 8-K filing. An update on these components will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in a few weeks.","In closing, the transition in both our operating and reporting structure represents a new era for McDonald\u2019s as we move toward becoming a more focused and efficient organization. While we are less than six months into executing our turnaround plan, our third quarter results demonstrate early signs of progress with both our top and bottom line results. We are encouraged by this progress, but recognized that there is much more work to be done. As we begin fourth quarter, we are energized by the challenges in front of us. Thanks.","And now I will turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Chris Stent","Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley","Good morning. Thank you. I would like to ask a about the U.S. all-day breakfast launch. I don\u2019t know if you can talk about the experience so far sales wise and whether you can talk about the sales or not, maybe talk about some of the operational issues, challenges and what you have learned kind of two weeks into the national launch?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, hi, Joe, Steve here. So, we launched officially nationwide on October 6, and I would say the enthusiasm levels from customers and from our teams in the restaurants are high. It\u2019s been a successful rollout. The owner\/operators have really embraced this. I mean, to go from a test market in May to a nationwide rollout by October is a significant validation of the alignment of the operators behind this. When they approved it, they approved it with a 98% plus approval rating around the country. So, there is a lot of unity and alignment behind it. And from an operational perspective having spent a fair bit of time in the markets the last two or three weeks, the operators have been really again enthused at the fact that this has created - it\u2019s been a lot smoother from an operational perspective than perhaps people had feared. The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well-established in the restaurants. And by launching all-day breakfast, whilst at the same time removing some of the more complex lower sales items at the same time, we have a net simplification in the restaurants, and we have a \u2013 we are driving full. So, it\u2019s early days to give too much a read on sales, but we are certainly encouraged. And more importantly, the owner\/operators are very encouraged about how we have kicked off.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.","Andy Barish","Hey, guys. Just on the U.S. margin side of the story, is that 400 basis points going to kind of continue on the labor line, just to try to get a sense of that investment over the next year or so?","Steve Easterbrook","Hey, Andy. As we announced in April, we made this decision to invest in our people and raise wages, provide paid time off. And at that time, we indicated that we expected the impact of this as well as other state-mandated increases to be about 200 basis points on our margins for the full year this year. Since obviously the large majority of that impact happens in the second half of the year that implies that the impact on the second half would be substantially more than 200 basis points. So, the impact is relatively in line with our expectations. The payback from the investment will take a little time in terms of lowering turnover, having stronger employees, deliver a better customer experience ultimately driving top line sales. Moving forward, it will obviously continue to impact margin comparisons for the next three quarters until we lap the July 1. But as you know, margins are also significantly impacted by our top line. So, if we are able to generate higher comps that would certainly mitigate some of that impact.","Kevin Ozan","Andy, just to add on to that, just clearly there is the cost element, we try to be very transparent about that. Ultimately, the ambition from the move we have made is to just drive the experience in the restaurants and we see this as a meaningful move for us to be able to attract and retain the best talent in the marketplace. And if we can drive some efficiencies by reducing turnover which a motivated, committed workforce tend to reduce the turnover levels, we maybe able to get some benefit if it come backs from that. But I just wanted to broaden out the conversation, because yes, there is a cost, but frankly, this is part of the bigger picture, running better restaurants, motivated teams and committed crew.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Billy Sherrill","Yes, thanks guys. It\u2019s actually Billy on for Will. Just wondering if now that we have a new reporting structure, if you could just kind of walk us through some of the cadence and I guess distribution I guess of the refranchising initiatives and maybe some of the new store openings across each segment?","Kevin Ozan","Yes. So, you can see the actual new store openings within each segment in the back of the earnings release. As far as moving forward and how kind of capital and refranchising and new openings may happen in the future, we will talk about that more in the upcoming investor meeting in November.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. Looking back at the summer \u201811 value menu, could you just comment as to where that did work, where it didn\u2019t work, some of the lessons of that? And separately, the simplification of the menu in the U.S, it seems to be something that\u2019s more to come. Where do you stand on that? And where do you see that going forward? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, hi David. So, from the value program across the sub, I think on the call last quarter, acknowledge that it got off to a little bit of a bumpy start as we launched it, it was in a way bumping into some of the local value initiatives that each of the regions were driving, which made \u2013 and then we reset and the performance of the $2.50 double cheese and small fry improved across the summer as the focus got clearer and our execution in the restaurants got sharper. So, it filled the gap for us. We do have a desire, along with our owner\/operators of a more sustained value platform, which we will be looking to introduce through 2016, but it certainly played a meaningful role across the summer helping to drive the footfall.","In terms of simplification, I just \u2013 again, simplification in the way we are looking at this and the way the team in the U.S. is looking at it is, menu is part of it, but there is a lot more we can do to help simplify the restaurants on a day-to-day basis, both from a customer perspective, but also from our managers and our crew. So, there is operational simplification, there is training simplification. There is things we can do with merchandising to make it easier for customers and navigate the restaurants and also with packaging as well. So, the team, there were sub-teams that are addressing each of these areas of opportunity. So, yes, menu is one piece, but the whole operational complexity, the training and merchandising and packaging is another. And it\u2019s the sum of those parts is what manages and begin to recognize that we are working hard to make their life a little easier, so they can just focus on what they love to do which is just running the restaurants and serving customers.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. The question is that you guys cite that the chicken item was \u2013 which I think most of us perceive to be somewhat premium was a successful driver and welcomed by the American consumer and the part of their recovery and the comp going positive. But a lot of the attention has been mentioned about sort of the value consumer and the value coming down. And there are some votes coming now on the new value menu in the weeks ahead. I am just curious, is this \u2013 has this experience maybe emboldened you to think there is and the new product innovation might be a little more skewing towards the premium side or how should we look at the \u2013 where the easiest opportunity is to recover if the consumer that might be in the near-term lapse and you can get back quicker and what would be the thing of the marketing they\u2019d respond to the most of, would you think it will be premium or value?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Thanks for the question. And again, the way we look at this is how can we deliver the best value across all tiers on that menu. So you are actually right with the buttermilk chicken. That was premium product, premium quality and a premium price that goes with it. And because of the taste, because of the quality and the execution of restaurants, their customers really did respond well. And as I said earlier, it\u2019s got outperformance at the high end of our expectations. But I think you would see, as we build our calendars out across any of our markets, but certainly here in the U.S, we do want to \u2013 we want to provide the best value of each level, great value core products, great value premium. And probably one of the areas where we are still a little weaker is at that more entry level, value level. And that\u2019s what you have been hearing about. And that\u2019s what \u2013 we are working with the operators on and the operators are aligning behind what they believe will be strong platform as we enter 2016 to help drive the foothold. Because we know that the top line going into positive territory was encouraging for us. There is no doubt about that. Our ultimate measure of success will be serving more customers more often and that\u2019s getting the guest counts moving as well.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jake Bartlett of SunTrust.","Jake Bartlett","Thanks for taking the question. Just to gauge the kind of the core, the turnaround in the U.S. aside from the breakfast all day, when do you think that the fourth quarter in the U.S. will be positive even without the breakfast all day introduction?","Steve Easterbrook","It\u2019s a difficult one to read. I mean what I would say is what has given me the most satisfaction from the way that the team have galvanized themselves in the U.S. is actually we are running better restaurants than we were a year ago. So if \u2013 and that is ultimately what customers respond to. And then as we innovate around the menu and have promotional activity and have fun with that, that would increment the sales, but running better restaurants day in and day out. And customers are telling us through this kind of very material feedback loop we have now that we are \u2013 they are noting the changes in the areas that mattered most to them, which is speed, friendliness and accuracy. Through the quarter, it\u2019s probably fair to say we ended the quarter just a little stronger than we started. But I wouldn\u2019t read too much into that. I mean, turnarounds are about momentum and we want to establish momentum over the short-term, medium-term and long-term. We have got one \u2013 we put one mark around that. And as we start to build quarter-upon-quarter, you will be able to read that no more underlying momentum in the business. But running better restaurants is a great start, shopping up our merchandising, simplifying the drive for operation, underpins everything else we are doing. So I feel good about that.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Sara Senatore of Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Thank you. I wanted to ask about some of the high growth markets. Obviously very, very strong comps out of China and it sounds like Russia also, I guess a couple of questions. One is you did mention that some near-term headwinds from volatility, but certainly \u2013 or a slowdown in the economy. But certainly, that wouldn\u2019t have appeared to be the case in the quarter. So I just wanted to ask about that comment. And also the margins there, again on such high comps, they might have expected even more margin expansion, can you just talk about, is that your emphasis on value in that market and clearly, again, with such strong comps, the right trade-off to make. But is that what we are seeing there. And I guess, last piece on that segment is, I think you are targeting more of a franchise mix. So is it safe to assume that most of the refranchising that you have laid out will come in China and Russia or a disproportionate amount? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","I think probably both Kevin and I will have a go on that one, Sara, there is a fair bit in there. So China clearly, took a hit third quarter last year. We expected a return to growth clearly. And we are pleased we did. I have got to say, I am very proud of the team in China. I am going to say I am very proud of the change in China because they were in a very difficult situation a year ago. And they said after facing a two-pronged approach to recover the business momentum. One was around trading hard and particularly trading hard on value. And the second one was restoring brand trust.","And actually, in that market now, our trust metrics are higher than they were prior to the supplier incidents a year ago. So I think that kind of validate the focus they have put on there. As we look forward, there are probably four elements the team are working on across the next couple of quarters, continuing on brand trust, consist everyday value at the entry and mid-tier levels. They have got a big an exciting play around convenience and particular around digital activation and delivery. So those are two drivers that aren\u2019t unique to China, but are very material to the consumer in China. Digital activation, working with some of main tech partners in China, we got some great relationships there and a very strong delivery business. And the full fun is just around consumer excitement, just having fun with products and the experience in the restaurants. So we \u2013 I don\u2019t want anyone to think that just because we were down last year, you would ultimately bounce back. You have got to work hard for it. The team have worked for it. And net-net, if you look at the 2-year comp, we were slightly up across that 2-year period, which across that quarter, which I think is credit to the team.","Kevin Ozan","Let me touch on margins and franchising. Related to margins in that group, a couple of things. One, certainly China\u2019s margins were covered in this quarter versus last year as a result of their sales recovery. Russia has currency pressure. We import a chunk of our food and paper in Russia both in terms of dollar and euro. And so there is still pressure on Russia\u2019s margins because of those imported food and paper costs. So that\u2019s still putting pressure on the margins within the high growth segment. Related to franchising, I think we have said that most of our franchising opportunities, certainly it\u2019s probably within Asia. So China certainly, would be a part of that. We will update a little bit more of our detailed franchising plans as we get to the investor meeting in November. But I think it\u2019s safe to say that the high-growth segment which certainly have franchising activity going forward.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thank you for the question. I not only originally started talking about some of the wage increases at your stores. My understanding was they are going to be phased in towards $10 over a period of year. So once we get, is that correct, once we get to sort of the four out of the 200 basis points, how to think about sort of the next, quantifying the next side of that. And then also, on the franchise side of this system, what sort of pressure might they be seeing on their margins right now from just overall wage pressures in the environment or is it another way to look at that just rate general wage inflation rates?","Kevin Ozan","Yes. Karen, the plan what was never to phase in kind of these increases. We did an increase across the board in July really impacting kind of all other the restaurants. So our average rate right now at our company operated restaurants is nearly $10 right now. And so I wouldn\u2019t see a significant additional phasing in above and beyond kind of where we are right now. Certainly, as state mandate changes, we may have to adjust to some of those. But there isn\u2019t another wave in our plans to go in and kind of it all restaurants again.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thank you. I want to understand a little bit more of where you are taking shares from. And I am not sure these are the buckets you would define it. But may you could adjust accordingly. But by \u2013 in order of magnitude, do you think that you are and can continue to pick up share from C stores or is it other legacy large QSR players or is it from consumers eating at home? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","So, this is a U.S. question, I am assuming, Nicole?","Nicole Miller Regan","Yes.","Steve Easterbrook","So, I will answer on that basis. Well, I think our immediate term is to win back share from the nearer term competition. That\u2019s what we are focused on. And then as we build out our experience in the future, I think that will get us \u2013 that will make us more attractive to a broader set of customers. But at the moment, I would say nearer term traditional competition is the market share we are biting at the moment. And clearly, we are playing to our strengths. Breakfast has always been a historic strength and we continue to do very well at breakfast during the breakfast daypart, but now into other dayparts as well.","Kevin Ozan","And just as an additional perspective, for the third quarter, our comp GAAP was a negative 3.2%. So, we still have room certainly to increase that. That\u2019s substantially down from Q2 and Q1. That\u2019s QSR sandwich category that it\u2019s against, but we certainly have opportunity and we have been seeing a few recent weeks kind of the opposite where we have been out comping some of that same competition.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","The U.S. segment, operating income was still down a little bit, even though comps turned positive and that\u2019s obviously because of all the investments you are making, but as you look out towards the next 6 to 12 months given the way you are thinking about cost, what type of same-store sales growth do we need to see some positive operating income growth to that overall segment? How are you thinking about that?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, Brian. We had a little difficulty hearing, but I think you are asking about kind of the U.S. comp and what we would need potentially to maintain or grow margins there. So, we obviously talked about the labor costs that are impacting the U.S. We have said in a normal inflationary environment, we generally need a 2% to 3% comp in the U.S. to maintain margins. With these additional labor costs, certainly the comp needed to maintain margins in the near-term would be higher than that. Commodities right now aren\u2019t a big pressure on us. And so commodities really aren\u2019t the concern. It\u2019s more of a comp needed to kind of overcome these near-term labor costs.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a good quarter. Just a question on all-day breakfast, I guess on any early read in terms of what your preliminary estimates might be on the comp benefit from the rollout? And I guess just maybe any early read on what kind of customer you are getting buying breakfast? Is it a new customer? Is it a cannibalizing sale? Any color there would be great.","Steve Easterbrook","I really don\u2019t want to give too much guidance here, Karen, not to be evasive, but just when you are a first couple of weeks in and we have got a lot of media behind it I don\u2019t want to give a wrong read. We are starting higher as you would expect out the box than what we would expect our steady run-rate to be when things settle down, but we see it being incremental profitable business that is driving existing customers in more often and attracting new customers. So, the anecdotals I get as I move around the country and getting to the restaurants is though if you are in a shoot in town, you are seeing a lot, a lot of activity into the evenings and the overnights around breakfast items that is just cultish amongst the students, but you can go directional mid-afternoon to see a more mature group that we are sitting there who can now enjoy the product with Egg McMuffin mid-afternoon and having to watch \u2013 clock watching and try and make the 10:30 a.m. deadline. So, it\u2019s just makes life easier for customers. They don\u2019t have to look at the watch and managed too hard their time. So, broad appeal, a strong start from an operational perspective, from an execution perspective and I think the team has done a great job from the marketing launch and just having some fun with it. I mean, more than anything else, it\u2019s fun. Customers are enjoying it and so our teams and restaurants.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.","Keith Siegner","Thank you. Congratulations. So, is this momentum in the U.S. hopefully, it builds off all of the stuff from ops, new products, value digital messaging, all this. How do you feel about the status of the U.S. asset base? And the opportunity maybe to kind of re-image into this momentum and even further bolster it? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","So, you said the work here. And the most important word, I think in any consumer base of business or any retail is momentum. And momentum breached confidence, confidence breached \u2013 it becomes a virtual cycle of success, if you like. And we are just beginning to feel some early signs of that and you can see the confidence flowing through the restaurants and through the teams. So, clearly, for a turnaround, you want sustained growth. And we have slowed by delivered one quarter. So, this is one data point, but the steps that we have taken to get to here are steps they are going to continue to keep supporting our business going forward.","Kevin Ozan","And one of the opportunities you mentioned, Keith, certainly is as you know, we are only about 50% re-imaged in the U.S. And so there is certainly opportunity going forward to more modernized that asset base in the U.S. and make sure that we have got the right facilities to bring in the customers that we want through on the cash.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Steve, I have a question or maybe a clarification on how you are thinking about the improvement you have seen in the U.S. business so far. And I guess specifically on the Q3 improvement as it seems like it got better as the quarter progressed. Do you think that was more about the new product news that you had or the structural improvements you are making in the restaurants with respect to operations? And then maybe as part of your answer to that, if you could touch on what the metrics look like on feed of service now that you simplified the drive through menu?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. I think there are number of ingredients that are beginning to come together. If you remember from the past, the U.S. undertook a fairly significant structural change itself. Now, about a year ago, where we eliminated and they are liberated a little more entrepreneurial spirit into the regions, that takes time to settle down. You can\u2019t just hit your stride straightaway. So, I think as the regions and the teams in the regions begin to find their feet as it were, that helps. I don\u2019t want to underestimate just the investments we are making in food quality. The investments that consumers care about such as the announcement to go to free range eggs, for example, such as the quality cues that you deliver with a buttermilk chicken. I mean, that is getting strong. But underpinning it and I will never ever move away from this, any market that\u2019s successful around the world is because they are focusing on the day-to-day operation and just delivering at that moment of truth for the customer. That is what McDonald\u2019s is all about.","What we are seeing with speed of service? Well, actually, we are seeing greater improvement in the accuracy. So, accuracy is probably the strongest metric improvement we are getting, which on the basis that about 70% of the business goes to the drive-through. Clearly, accuracy is particularly important. But we begin to see a few seconds being shaved our average service times as we simplify the menu and sharpening up the operations, but it\u2019s early days and we have got \u2013 there is a lot more progress we want to make, I have got to say that.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. My question has to do with the new operating segments, particularly outside the United States, can you \u2013 on two items. Can you talk about is this what the cost savings opportunities you are discovering are? It looks like G&A in many of those segments are lower, but maybe you are just picking it up on the corporate or you are actually finding real opportunities to consolidate some of those into the new structure? And from an operating standpoint, given your first quarter of operating into these different segments, are there examples of where you are operating the restaurants differently, because different leaderships looking at these markets differently or is that too early to really say?","Kevin Ozan","Alright. I will start with the cost item and I will let Steve talk about kind of the leadership and running the markets differently. Couple of things going on here. One, you may have seen and it may have been a little confusing, but we tried to explain one of the things that\u2019s gone on is we are moving a little bit from a very decentralized structure to one that centralizes certain non-customer facing functions and activities. So, along with that, some costs that historically were managed at a segment level now are being managed or will be managed at a central corporate level. So, some of the costs that were reflected last year in the segments are now in corporate, about $30 million of those in total of those costs. That doesn\u2019t impact consolidated or total G&A. That\u2019s more of just a reallocation. At the same time, we obviously talked about saving real consolidated G&A. And as I said, we are making progress on that and we will give a further update on those activities and the investor meeting in November.","Kevin Ozan","And John, I will just talk about, if you like the operating segments and just the way the leadership teams are thinking. And we will certainly give more flavor to this in our investor meeting. But if I would just to take the lead market as an example, we have got the five major countries that contribute to the lead markets. They are overseen by a team of just three people. Now these are three very senior, highly talented individuals. But the decision making \u2013 and the feasibility into those five markets is so much clearer because we have removed the layers that tend to just obscure what\u2019s going on. So if those three leaders can see something work in Australia. Our ability to share that with the Canadians, whether it\u2019s the UK, German, France team and vice versa, obviously it\u2019s far clearer. So the speed of the decision making, visibility into what\u2019s working, visibility to what\u2019s not working and just sharing that knowledge and getting to market quicker with things that work, we are already seeing the benefits of that. And I think that\u2019s incredibly encouraging, because we have always had pockets of excellence. I want fewer pockets of excellence, I want a broader base excellence, so I believe this structure will help you deliver that.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","Thanks. Sorry if I missed the question, I am actually multitasking myself. But given the importance of a national price pointed value platform that you guys have discussed in the past, can you walk us through the steps you could take to potentially make that happen. I guess what I mean by that is any potential timeline for formulation of the menu testing of that menu and then assuming you are happy with the results, potentially, how quickly should we see a broad based national price pointed value platform hit the U.S?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. So I mean the process that I am showing you a fairly familiar here in the U.S. is somewhat unique compared to other markets around the world, because it\u2019s, by nature, a more complex and diverse market side here in the U.S. We are at the stage now where driven by insights, we have created a number of potential concepts. Some of those are in test already, but they are being discussed and being aborted on for approvals and discussed by the operators now. So the national teams have had more rigor around it and challenged it and have come up with really strong, could be strong compelling. The operators discussing that and they will make the right decision because the most important piece is alignment. And we have got great alignment now as a result of all-day breakfast. And that is \u2013 that\u2019s part of the magic ingredient that McDonald\u2019s here in the U.S. and the alignment with the owner operators. And I know that doing the right thing working through it and certainly into next year, will be a line \u2013 there will be something that we believe will be competitive from a customer perspective.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Howard Penney at Hedgeye.","Howard Penney","Hi. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Steve, you used the phrase net simplification a couple of times I think in your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could explain that term, I know you have talked about simplification before, but what does net simplification mean and how much more is there to go?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. I would tell you, Howard and thank you for the question because I have strong conviction of around simplifying our restaurant operations, because I believe the customer is the ultimate beneficiary. And then, when we do talk about doing something like an all-day breakfast, people scratching their head and say, well hold on a minute. You told about simplification, but now you are adding. So when I talk about net. I am saying we go t to take more complexity out through our decision -making that we ever put in, so that\u2019s where one kind of \u2013 my language of net simplification works. So if we are not adding any new SKUs into the restaurant for breakfast because all the ingredients are already there. They are in the chillers, they are in the freezers, the equipment is already in place. So yes, there is the operational shift running. There is an operational complexity, but not an ingredient complexity.","In the meantime, around the country, we have \u2013 the U.S. team has been very rigorous in their analytics on this and helping provide each and every color with a tool that helps them assess operational complexity versus contribution to product mix and margin. And then as a final screen which is around the brand value. So that\u2019s helps \u2013 have actual detailed insight and rigor around supporting the costs taking items off. So on average, right I think you need at the start of the year, we removed around 7 items from the menu. It\u2019s probably at leased another seven, if not more on average across the comps around the country now. And I know they are continuing on this path. And as we offer more abilities to customize and personalize food going forward, that may give us another opportunity to actually take further items on. So I hope that makes sense. The trouble saying simplification is definitely whenever you do [indiscernible] say on a hold a minute and making more complex. We are not going to be static. We are going to be energetic. We will innovate. We will have new products. It\u2019s fun and that\u2019s what customers want. We have got to make sure that we take more than that out of the restaurant complexity. So I hope that makes a little more sense.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andrew Charles at Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Thank you. Just on the improved order accuracy in the U.S., how do you plan to sustain this improvement as customization and personalization will become increasingly component of the experience as of the case in Australia, obviously digital initiatives can be a big help, but any other factors that we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. I think two-pronged again, just from the day-to-day operation with our teams in the field, it\u2019s around trading. And the training that was rolled out across of the U.S., which was actually was an operator lead initiative initially, was around something called ask us teller. The way that we reconfigured our own internal procedures of how we take the orders, confirm the orders and then present the orders. And that has had a positive notable benefit in our accuracy. As we go forward, the more of that heavy lifting that we can get technology to do and the greater our accuracy will become. So whether it\u2019s ordering through apps, whether it\u2019s ordering it through self-order kiosks that we see elsewhere around the world, technology can certainly help us with putting the customer in charge of the ordering process and allowing technology to do the heavy lifting and then we can just prepare the food and serve it in a friendly way, so two pronged. We will never get away from day-to-day training. But secondly, we are working hard on the technology to help support this.","Chris Stent","We have time for one more question. Next in the queue is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just two follow-ups, one on the all-day breakfast, I know there has been lots of questions on the topic, I am just wondering being that you had at least some tests for a while was there any color in terms of what type of lift you might have seen in test market or maybe what that mix has gone to in that test market. And the other question was just on \u2013 you mentioned you had commodity costs. So it sounds like beef isn\u2019t that onerous and I think you said the overall basket was only up 1% this past quarter. I am just wondering what your thoughts are as we look ahead and whether that could actually \u2013 do you think qualitatively that would impact McDonald\u2019s or maybe the industry as you think about promotions and discounting and your new value platform potentially?","Steve Easterbrook","Okay. I will take the first one, Jeff. So I am a fairly resilient guy. I won\u2019t get worn down by the same question kind of asked different direction. But I appreciate the interest. And of course we are as well. What I would say is the test markets gave us that kind of \u2013 that curve of initial launch volumes and then the settling down sustaining because that being trade to the business case that then got the buying from the broader operating community. So we are confident in the kind of the curve we expect to see of the contribution of all-day breakfast. We are encouraged that it\u2019s 30 days. We are sitting here today, 15 or 16 days in. And I can tell you that the unity of the system around this and the responsible customers, which is the important piece is very positive. We will get share a bit more in November, obviously. Totally understand the interest in it. But it\u2019s just too early. It just wouldn\u2019t be fair to give a read on it right now.","Kevin Ozan","And then related to the commodity costs in the U.S. yes, we said it was up about 1%, primarily beef costs, not a lot of commodity pressure on the other commodities in the third quarter. Going forward again, what the rest of the outlook stuff since it\u2019s all interconnected, we will provide an update at our upcoming investor meeting related to kind of how things look in the future.","Chris Stent","We are near the top of the hour. So I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Thank you, Chris. And again, thanks for everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to emphasize our commitment across of the entire system to consistently running great restaurants to give our customers even more reasons to dine at McDonald\u2019s. We are focusing on executing fewer, bigger initiatives that will ultimately deliver better experience for our guests around the areas that matter most to the great-tasting food, fast friendly service, contemporary restaurant experience, all at the value of McDonald\u2019s. The progress we have made in a short amount of time gives me confidence that we are making the right moves to turnaround our business and reposition McDonald\u2019s as a modern, progressive burger company. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13880":["McDonald's Corp.

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan; and President of McDonald's USA, Chris Kempczinski.","Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and the 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our momentum continued to build across the business in the third quarter. Across all our operating segments, we serve more customers, more often, driving global comparable sales up 6% and comparable guest counts up 2.4%. This marks nine consecutive quarters of global comparable sales growth and our third consecutive quarter of comparable guest count growth. We're building a better McDonald's and winning back customers with great-tasting food, compelling value and an enhanced experience.","In each of these areas, our markets have built sustainable platforms, integrated and grounded in deep local insights. They've enabled us to move at greater speed, efficiency and impact to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Whilst we've been building momentum across the McDonald's system, and our performance is globally broad-based, I'm particularly pleased that the U.S. business has regained its stride.","As Mike mentioned at the top of the call, we have Chris Kempczinski, President of McDonald's USA, joining us today. Later in the call, Chris will provide insight into the drivers of U.S. performance.","But to get us started, Kevin will provide texture on our financial results for the quarter.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. As Steve mentioned, our positive comparable sales and guest counts in all segments reflect the momentum that continues to build across our system. I want to provide a little more context on how each segment contributed to our global performance for the third quarter.","U.S. comp sales increased 4.1% for the quarter, with a positive comp sales gap versus our QSR sandwich competitors. Chris will provide more details on the drivers of this performance in a few minutes.","Comparable sales for the International Lead market segment were up 5.7%, led by continued strong momentum in the UK and Canada and positive performance across the rest of the segment. High Growth segment comp sales increased 6.2%, with China continuing its strong performance as the most significant contributor and the segment's European markets delivering strong comps as well. And comparable sales for the Foundational markets rose 10.2%, led by Japan's double-digit comp performance along with positive results in each of the segment's geographic regions.","Our Velocity Growth Plan is not only driving top-line growth, it's also benefiting our operating performance. Earnings per share for the quarter grew more than 50% to $2.32. This included $0.56 of special items, consisting of a gain on the sale of our businesses in China and Hong Kong and unrelated non-cash impairment charges. Excluding these items and prior-year strategic charges, our EPS was $1.76, up 9%, or 7% in constant currencies, over third quarter last year.","Moving on to pricing in commodities, our third quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up 2.2%, which was slightly below food away from home inflation of 2.4%, as we continue to have a disciplined approach to menu pricing and provide our great-tasting food at an affordable price.","Commodity costs in the U.S. for the third quarter were up 1.5% versus last year. We continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase about 1% for the full year, reflecting the anticipated commodity pressure in the back half of the year. For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were up more than 2.5% for the third quarter, and menu prices were up about 1.5% year-over-year.","Moving down the P&L, for the quarter, our positive comp sales along with the combined impact of our major refranchising transactions drove an increase in franchise margins of $219 million and a decline in company-operated margins of $148 million. On a percentage basis, consolidated company-operated margins increased 70 basis points to 19.1% for the quarter. About half of the improvement was due to the benefit of having no depreciation expense for China and Hong Kong, as the assets were classified as held for sale until July 31.","For the High Growth segment, about three-quarters of the margin percent improvement can be attributed to this same benefit. On a percentage basis, we expect fourth quarter margins for the remaining company-operated restaurants in the High Growth segment to be similar to results reported in fourth quarter 2016, as the segment will no longer have this depreciation benefit.","Regarding G&A, at the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected our G&A for the year to be down about 7% to 8% in constant currencies, with fluctuations between quarters due to the timing of spending. For the third quarter, our G&A was down 4% in constant currencies, which resulted in total costs being down 8% through the first nine months of the year. We now expect G&A cost to be down about 7% for the full year, which means fourth quarter G&A should be down a similar percentage to third quarter.","Third and fourth quarter G&A are higher than first and second quarter this year, primarily due to two main reasons: higher technology spending in the back half of the year as we continue to develop, enhance and deploy technology solutions like our global mobile app and kiosks; and higher spend in the U.S. in the back half of the year, as they deploy Experience of the Future, mobile and delivery.","Our third quarter effective tax rate was 33.2%, and the nine month tax rate was 32.8%. Given that, we now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 32% to 33%.","Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation benefited results by $0.02 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect a positive impact from foreign currency of $0.04 to $0.06 for the fourth quarter and about $0.01 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year.","Finally, as we communicated last month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.01 per share, the equivalent of $4.04 annually. This reinforces our confidence in the company's long-term strategy and our expectation to return $22 billion to $24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019.","Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to spend a minute on the achievement of a milestone in our strategic franchising initiative. The sale of our China and Hong Kong markets in the third quarter caps off our goal to refranchise 4,000 company-owned restaurants, which will accelerate our growth in these markets while creating a more stable stream of revenue and earnings.","In just under three years, we've increased the percentage of franchised restaurants from 81% to 91%. And franchised margins will now comprise more than 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars going forward. We'll continue to optimize our ownership mix by refranchising restaurants in certain of our large mature markets, like the U.S., using the same financial rigor and discipline that we began a couple years ago. And we'll continue to evaluate other markets to determine whether a developmental license model is the right model to efficiently grow in those markets.","As I said at our March 1 Investor Day, our refranchising activity will have a dilutive impact on our revenue, operating income and EPS growth rates in the near term, making year-over-year comparisons through 2018 choppy.","We received cash proceeds of about $1.6 billion from the China, Hong Kong transaction, which we plan to use to repurchase shares. We expect the refranchising transactions completed over the last year will have a negative impact on EPS of a few cents per quarter until third quarter 2018.","Also, the depreciation benefit of about $100 million that we realized this year will not reoccur in 2018. Going forward, our results for these markets include sales-based royalties, along with a 20% equity pick-up for China, Hong Kong.","The critical moves we've made through our refranchising efforts will benefit our business for years to come as our strategic partners unlock the growth potential in these markets, without the use of our G&A and capital resources, while we receive a steady stream of royalty income. And they will also lead to an increase in our operating margin on our way to a target of mid-40s under our new more heavily-refranchised and efficient business model.","So in the near-term, we're focused on growing comparable sales and guest counts and we're pleased with our recent performance which has benefited primarily from running better restaurants. At the same time, we're confident that our velocity accelerators of Experience of the Future, digital and delivery will continue to grow the business.","Beginning in 2019, once we've lapped completion of the major refranchising transactions, we expect to return to revenue growth and also achieve the other long-term financial targets that we've established, including steady and reliable earnings growth.","Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. At the top of the call, I talked about the growth platforms each market has built around menu, value and experience that is designed to grow guest counts, by retaining the customers we have, regaining customer visits we've lost and converting casual customers to more committed customers.","During the quarter, each market executed with innovative and compelling approaches to menu, value and convenience that drove incremental customer traffic and higher average check. Every major market now offers a range of premium chef-crafted big burgers and chicken sandwiches with artisan ingredients and enticing flavor profiles.","In France, the Signature beef and chicken line uses breads, meats, cheeses and sauces that capture the regional gastronomy of the country. The UK is having great success in their modernized restaurants with their version of Signature beef, inspired by the English pub burgers with thick, juicy beef and beechwood-smoked bacon, piled high with freshly-prepared toppings on a brioche-style bun. Canada's launch of the Seriously Chicken platform appeals to Canadians' preference for international flavors with local sourcing. It provides a great complement to the market's popular Mighty Angus beef burgers.","Italy took note of the success that France and the U.S. had with Grand Mac, and Italians loved it.","We know that customers motivated primarily by value and deals come more often and spend more. During the quarter, our markets offered compelling value across the breadth of the menu. For example, Japan, Italy, France and many other markets executed value programs and promotions that leveraged the strength of our popular Minions Happy Meal to drive incremental family business with value bundles and dessert specials.","We are increasingly driving traffic and check growth with digital offers. Retention of mobile offers continues to grow month-on-month, with a meaningful portion of the redemptions representing incremental visits.","Importantly, this is also building our base of digital users, increasing awareness and adoption as we deploy the mobile order and pay functionality of our mobile path. Although they did not have a material impact on our results for the quarter, we are making solid progress on the deployment of our Velocity Growth Plan accelerators. We remain on track to deploy mobile order and pay to 20,000 restaurants by the end of the year, including all of our U.S. restaurants. We continue to learn as we deploy, rapidly implementing updates, which has challenges and opportunities as we expand in each successive market.","We made significant progress with expanding delivery of scale throughout our markets. Over the course of the past nine months, we've introduced delivery in over 5,000 restaurants across 20 countries. Along with the 3,500 restaurants in existing delivery markets across Asia and the Middle East, we now offer delivery in over 20% of McDonald's restaurants around the world. We continue to improve the model as we scale, remaining on track to offer delivery in 10,000 total restaurants by the end of the year.","We're take learnings from our top-performing delivery markets and spreading the best approaches around the world. We remain confident that delivery will be a powerful accelerator for our business as we look at markets where it's gaining traction.","The third velocity accelerator is rolling out Experience of the Future, or EOTF. We are continuing with improvements inside our restaurants that make the customer experience more personal and less stressful.","EOTF now has been deployed with all elements in roughly a quarter of the restaurants in the McDonald's system. As they approach full deployment, the UK and Canada are proving how powerful EOTF can be for our customers. And in France and Germany, where we've rolled out EOTF to about one-third of the restaurants in both countries, we're seeing similar results. And many of our other large international markets are not far behind.","Successful execution of our growth strategy and, in particular, our digital, delivery and Experience of the Future initiatives, requires the full support and commitment of our Owner\/Operators. Recently, I joined Chris on market visits to cities such East St. Louis, Detroit, Cleveland and Salt Lake City. I saw many examples where we're successfully running better restaurants, which left me confident about the great alignment we enjoy with our Owner\/Operators in the U.S. We share a vision for the future and they're committed to driving the operational excellence that will be key to our success.","Now, we'll hear more about the progress of our U.S. business. Thanks for joining us today, Chris.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Thank you, Steve. I appreciate the opportunity to join the call today and update everyone on the state of our U.S. business. The U.S. continues to demonstrate solid growth, and I'm proud of our system and the progress we're making. As I look ahead to 2018, I'm excited about our pipeline of ideas and the growth potential they offer. For us, the key will be to execute at a really high level across a number of initiatives and we're investing a lot of time and effort right now to get that right.","Let me provide more insight into our Q3 performance and then I'll talk about how we're preparing for 2018. During Q3, we grew comp sales 4.1%, resulting in a comp sales gap of 440 basis points versus the QSR sandwich competitors. Importantly, our comp sales growth was supported by positive guest count growth. This is our third consecutive quarter of positive comp sales growth and second consecutive quarter of positive comp guest count growth. For the past three quarters, we have posted a favorable comp gap versus QSR. We're particularly pleased with this performance because we had to overcome the headwinds of a sluggish overall IEO market that currently offers limited traffic growth.","Our success can be attributed to several factors. First, we offered compelling consistent value programs across a number of tactics that clearly resonated with our customers. We continued our $1 any size soft drinks program and supplemented it with the return of McPick 2 for $5 that offered some exciting food deals. We're also starting to get real traction with the targeted mobile offers via our app that are tailored to customers' unique buying preferences.","Second, we've been able to capitalize on this increased traffic into our restaurants with menu news that drove customers to trade up to premium higher-margin products. In Q2, we launched our Signature Crafted sandwich line available either in beef or chicken, with three flavor combinations, pico guacamole, sweet barbecue bacon and maple bacon Dijon. In August, we rotated in a new Sriracha flavor that gave the sandwich Crafted line an extra kick.","In September, we also reintroduced McCaf\u00e9 to the U.S. This meant a new, more modern look for the McCaf\u00e9 brand and new choices, including the reintroduction of our McCaf\u00e9 Espresso line after a significant equipment upgrade across our system. The McCaf\u00e9 Espresso products perform very well, reaffirming our systems confidence that McCaf\u00e9 can be a significant growth platform for us in the future. As we've seen with both Signature Crafted and McCaf\u00e9, when we improve the taste and quality of our products to meet customers' rising expectations, they reward us with more business.","Finally, we're seeing encouraging customer response to our velocity accelerators including delivery, digital and Experience of the Future. Through our partnership with UberEATS, we now offer delivery in 3,700 restaurants and we're on track to reach 5,000 restaurants by year-end. We're learning a lot about delivery and seeing particular success in dense urban metros with high penetration of younger customers, like New York, Boston, Miami and Los Angeles. I truly believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface on this opportunity.","We're also continuing to roll out mobile order and pay with a new curbside check-in option. I'm really excited about the potential of curbside to evaluate the convenience of McDonald's to a whole new level for our customers. We now have mobile order and pay in over 6,000 restaurants. And we expect to reach all 14,000 restaurants by the end of the year.","And last, we're making good progress with our Experience of the Future projects and we're seeing comp sales lifts consistent with our targets. We currently have Experience of the Future deployed in 13% of restaurants and that number will increase significantly over the next couple of years.","As the pace of activity in the U.S. accelerates, it's critical that our restaurants are properly staffed and trained to execute at a high level. Our McOpCo and operator organizations are investing in labor right now to train for initiatives like hot off the grill, hospitality, curbside, delivery. This will have a temporary impact on margins for the next six to 12 months as we work through our deployment calendar. We've seen this before in other markets like Canada, Australia and the UK when they've launched similarly aggressive plans and we feel quite confident about our ability to manage through this short-term situation.","At the same time, we're also ramping up our internal project management capabilities to prepare, deploy and maximize each initiative. We've created dedicated Project Management Offices at both the national and regional levels to ensure we anticipate resource bottlenecks and flex organizational capacity as needed. We aim to prove that size and speed do not need to be antithetical to one another.","Two years ago, Steve declared that McDonald's needed to run better restaurants and nowhere was that more evident than in the U.S. market. As Steve mentioned, we recently visited a number of U.S. cities, including East St. Louis, Cleveland, Detroit, Salt Lake, Houston and it was really a proud moment for our owner operators to showcase their progress.","On almost every dimension, the U.S. is running better restaurants and that's showing up in the business results. At the same time, that pride and confidence in our performance is helping to energize the system to pursue an even more aggressive growth agenda. Almost 100% of U.S. operators have now signed commitment letters in support of a holistic multi-year growth strategy that will update the entire system to EOTF, make important equipment upgrades to deliver better food and ensure we remain competitive on value.","We're excited about what's to come in the U.S., and I look forward to updating you periodically on our progress.","Now, back to you, Mike.","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Chris. We'll now open the call for analysts and investor questions. Now, the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. If I could just do one question for Kevin, you mentioned some facts speaking to this. Obviously, your profit growth, excluding one-times, was very strong in the U.S. and in International Lead, but was held back by other High Growth and foundation (sic) [Foundational] markets. And clearly, you're getting some refranchising and licensing actions dragging on that. I think originally, you thought flat EBIT impact from these effects, these refranchising and licensing actions. Is that still the expectation? How much was the drag, and then should we expect an equal tailwind perhaps starting in the third quarter in 2018? Thank you.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Hey, David. Yes. So let me try and explain. As you mentioned, there's a lot of noise in this quarter and there will be for the next few quarters because of these refranchising transactions. So what we've said is once you kind of lap these franchising transactions, so I'll say beginning in fourth quarter of 2018, that's when we get to what I'll call the new norm. Until then, it's going be a little rough on a comparison basis because you have two things going against you. One is kind of the results of these markets as wholly-owned in 2017 compared to them as developmental license markets in 2018. And on top of that, you have this depreciation benefit that we received in 2017 that we won't have in 2018.","Once we get through all of that, what we've said is essentially on a EPS level at the beginning is we'll be relatively neutral because the proceeds we've gotten in, we will use to buy back shares. And so at an EPS level, we'll be effectively relatively neutral once we're able to buy all those shares and have them built into the calculation. Operating income in the near term will be down a little bit because the income we've given up as wholly-owned is more in the near term than the income we'll get on a royalty basis, if you will, as a DL.","On a free cash flow basis, it'll be immediately accretive because the capital that we're saving from the DL-ing these markets effectively outweighs the operating income that I'm losing. So it will be immediately accretive to free cash flow. Thanks.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein. Sara?","Anna Papp - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. This is actually Anna Papp representing Sara. So in terms of delivery, do you now have a large enough sample to draw some conclusions about the impact on comps? And also, can you talk a little bit about profitability? One of the things we hear from some of the private companies we speak to is that it's difficult to make delivery profitable even when it's outsourced to third parties and, therefore, doesn't require as much in upfront investments. Could you talk a little bit about what kinds of fixed and variable costs your franchisees incur and what kind of profitability you anticipate? Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Right. I'll have a stab at that one. So I mean, clearly, we're getting enough of an early read to be encouraged by delivery. So we've pursued \u2013 delivery have pursued a very aggressive rollout program. And our primary lead partner on this one has been UberEATS. And effectively, we've looked to expand wherever UberEATS has coverage around the world. And they've actually been doubling-down on their expansion to help meet our ambition as well, so it's been working well as a partnership between the two of us. And yes, we're getting good early trading results.","What we are finding is, not surprisingly, the number of guest counts per store per day does correlate pretty highly to consumer awareness of this. So the markets that have been able to more effectively promote and raise the customer awareness are getting higher take-up per day. I'm not going get into the actual comp buildup on this one, but it's a meaningful contributor in the restaurants that offer delivery. As I say, I want to just make sure we're guarded about what we're saying. We're in 5,000 restaurants so far out of 37,000. So it's meaningful in those that offer it, but clearly we've got some ways to go to get the further scale across the global system.","In terms of profitability, it's important that the vast majority of our business is incremental because the way that we're working with the third party operators is \u2013 obviously, there's a commercial relationship between ourselves and a third party operator that would take some of our margin. So we need certainly more than half of this business, if not more than that, to be incremental. And we're certainly finding that we are well up that scale actually. It's really, really encouraging for us.","And part of the reason we know that is because we're beginning to collect the consumer data now as well. So we can actually get repeat visit information, daypart information. And the fact that more than 60% of our business comes in evening and overnight, we know is reinforcing the fact this is an incremental business opportunity, revenue stream that we weren't previously tapping into.","But we're also getting very strong repeat business from those that use it as well, which again further encourages us. And one of the things we are focusing on internally is what is there that we can do to get the awareness of the fact that we're offering delivery higher up in consumers' minds. So, yes, it's profitable. It's incremental business. And we're looking to continue to go hard at this. And we certainly know our operators are enthusiastic, as are we, as a corporation.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. Karen?","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. A question on U.S. margins where you talked about some of those upfront investments that you're making behind new initiatives, is that what we're seeing at store level in the year-over-year margin pressure? And then, if so, when you talk about that by six to nine months and then do you actually see costs go away? Or is it the expectation that you would be able to leverage into kind of covering those costs? Thanks.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, hi, Karen. It's Chris. So certainly, what you're seeing in the trading results that we just posted, you're seeing primarily labor related to the training that I was talking about. There is some commodity inflation, but the biggest drag that we're facing right now is related to the labor investments that are being made.","In terms of going forward, I think one of the pieces that remains to be seen for us is just what does the long-term labor inflation look like in the U.S. And so, we have seen with roughly 5% unemployment that labor inflation has been ticking up nationally. In addition, there's local legislation that's going on as well, where minimum wage laws are increasing.","So that long-term could be a headwind, which just would require a faster growth rate than what we've historically seen. But I think right now, it's unclear where that goes. I think for us, certainly the investments that we're make right now on training, those are one-time investments that would abate in the next six to 12 months. And I think the longer term, is we just need to keep our eye on labor inflation across the U.S.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Karen, I'll just hook on the back of those well because Chris is right. I guess the tone of the conversations we have, not just with management teams but with our Owner\/Operators, clearly is we have a really solid plan. I mean, Chris and the team here have built an ambitious, very broad-based plan. And having a plan is a great start, but you've got to execute it. And we've been very mindful that it is getting the restaurant level details right is more important than having the perfect plan. And we've seen this, wherever we have an execution gap between a stretch in execution, it kind of catches us out because the customers get impacted.","And we've also got some great recent experiences with UK and Canada and Australia, who have all deployed ambitious multi-faceted plans. And we've seen this kind of a trend where you'll invest a little more in the shorter-term on the P&L in order to get the execution right. But the payback then comes over that medium to longer term. So I'm comfortable with where we're at. It doesn't mean we're blas\u00e9 about it, but this is not unexpected to us. And, as I say, getting the execution right is our primary focus.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. Brian?","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Can you just talk a little bit more about your national value platform strategy launching in the United States in early 2018? Any details you're going to provide on that strategy would be helpful to us. And in addition to that, if you could just also address how you expect your U.S. franchisees are going to strategize, making incremental investments and value at a time when store-level margins are declining from the labor investments and what-not. Thanks.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Sure. Well, one of the things that we have said to our franchisees in the U.S. is we don't have to win on value, but we can't lose on value. And that means we have to be competitive with our investments against a value program. And I think also it's no surprise that over the last, call it, three or four years since we rolled off Dollar Menu, we weren't as competitive as we needed to be on value.","And so what you're going to see from us next year is us being really fully competitive with our near-in competitors with a value program there. It's been written about and I don't think it's any surprise that certainly our value program is going to be focused on $1, $2 and $3 price points for an everyday-value piece of it. And then there will also be deals that will pulse in and out throughout the year as a result of that.","When you talk about the investment that is being asked of Owner\/Operators, one of the things that we talked about is that this plan has to be looked at holistically. And so while there is an investment that's being made on the value side, there are also some significant efficiencies that are being captured on the other side, around particularly marketing and efficiencies that we're getting there, efficiencies that we're getting at the restaurant level. And so when you look at all of it on a blended basis, we think that this is a balanced plan. And I think, most importantly, the fact that our Owner\/Operators were at almost 100% signing up for is probably the best testament that they felt comfortable with the value investments being offset by some of the other things in the P&L.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","And I think it's also noteworthy, Chris, that the commitments that's been signed up to is to have the national support, so that the need for some of the local value initiatives is somewhat reduced, because we're putting the national muscles to play here on to support the program, which I think is exciting for us at we enter 2018.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank. Brett?","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Thank you. You obviously started to talk more about coffee at your March Investor Day and once again reiterated that it's doing well. What can you share in terms of how much faster it's growing than your overall comp? What are you seeing in terms of daypart breakfast, afternoon, and attachments? And, if I could, how is that doing in terms of traditional in-store purchases versus your mobile order and the loyalty program? Thank you.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Well, I think we're excited about coffee, in part, because it's a huge category. It's a $30 billion business in the U.S. and it's growing mid-to-high-single digits as a category. So we're excited about the category. It's high margin and we're under-penetrated there. So as we built the plan, it was rally about us getting after an opportunity where we think our McCaf\u00e9 brand has a lot of relevance.","We're not going get into the specifics of by product line item, how did those compare versus the average comp, but I would just say that, certainly, we saw the benefit in Q3 of really nice growth on our McCaf\u00e9 business. And as we look out over the next few years, we're expecting to use McCaf\u00e9 as really a platform for us to get additional growth. So we're excited about that. We think we have a good opportunity to get after it. It's really been a question of focus for us. We haven't consistently focused on this in the past. And going forward, it's going be a key area for us.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I'd also just say from a global perspective, when you look at the overall velocity plan that we talk about, Brett, coffee and McCaf\u00e9 is at a different stage in different markets. But if you actually look at the key drivers behind the velocity plan, on the retained category, about retaining customers, clearly, a strong compelling coffee plays really well alongside the food-led breakfast advantage that we have.","When you look at regain, there, as we build out our digital capabilities and loyalty in CRM, we think coffee, because it's such a habitual purchase, will play well against those customers who we want to encourage back more often.","Then finally, when we talk about converting casual customers to committed, we know coffee and snacking plays strongly against some of those more casual consumers. So each of our major countries, as I said, has a different stage of development of their McCaf\u00e9 programs, but the one thing I would say is that coffee plays a part in all those markets as we go forward.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. John?","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Good morning. Two cost-related questions; one is just on the SG&A. So as you've gotten further into technology, it sounds like there was maybe a little heavier spending this quarter. Do you still have the same confidence that you can achieve the overall SG&A goals that you laid out earlier or does this quarter make you think about you need to put more money into that in 2018? Can you reiterate what those goals are and if they've changed at all?","The other component of your business that's grown has been the gains on asset sales, excluding the China. It's been still a few hundred million dollars a year. Does that effectively go to nil over the next couple years as refranchising is complete? Or is that still an ongoing piece like it should trade in and out of markets, for example?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, John. Thanks. Let me start with the G&A. What I'd say is right now, we're completely on track with where we expected to be this year. As I said in my remarks, we expected to be down about 7% to 8% in constant currencies. We still expect to be down about 7% for the year. Having said that, it probably is a little more back-loaded this year than we probably thought at the beginning of the year. So the timing of it is a little bit more back-loaded.","But what we're seeing is we're achieving significant savings from our refranchising and we're also seeing significant savings in our maintenance, our running the business G&A. That's being partly offset by a significant increase in technology spending. So we're achieving net G&A savings and, at the same time, we're shifting more of our existing spend from maintenance G&A to what I'll call investment G&A, focused on growing the business. So I think overall, we feel a lot better today about where we're spending our G&A, but we're on track with kind of all of our original plans at this point.","Regarding the gains, it's a good point. I think you'll probably still see gains in 2018 as we continue to refranchise in some of our conventional license markets, the U.S. and some of the International Lead. After that, that will likely go down a little bit. We won't have as much of the refranchising transactions. We will still have restaurants that exchange hands in kind of normal course of business, so there will always be some restaurants that, just as we always optimize our mix, we'll have some. But it probably won't be to the level that we've seen the last couple years and maybe in 2018. After that, it will likely go down a little bit.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG. Peter?","Peter Saleh - BTIG LLC","Great. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious if you could comment a little bit on speed of service in the U.S. and how the Experience of the Future restaurants are comparing on speed of service ticket times versus the rest of the system? Are they moving faster or are they moving slower? Any other sort of color would be helpful.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, well, so I'd say what we typically see is as we're deploying, whether it's EOTF, some of the menu news, et cetera, we typically do see a slight uptick in service times, call it, on the order of five seconds or so. And then, certainly as the crew in restaurants get more experience in whatever the initiative is, we expect to claw most, if not all, of that back over time. I think it's, for us, when you look at the Experience of the Future, one of the things that makes it difficult to really do the from-to on that is because as we bring in Experience of the Future with curbside, you start introducing all sorts of new ways for the customer to interact with the brand.","And so maybe in the past, they would just go through the drive-thru because, frankly, they didn't see going into the restaurant as a great experience. Now, they want to go into the restaurants because it's an updated modernized experience where you can get table service there. And so it's really, I think, what we're seeing with Experience of the Future is that customers are choosing new ways to interact with the brand that makes it difficult for us to compare. I think the more relevant metric really, for us, is we look at customer satisfaction.","We look at customer satisfaction prior to EOTF and after EOTF. And what we're seeing there are significant improvements on the order of three to five points improvements in overall customer satisfaction. So for us, that gives us reassurance that they are enjoying the initiatives that we're deploying with EOTF and they're having a better experience.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I mean, Chris is absolutely right. I think part of our broader philosophy around Experience of the Future is putting that choice and control in the hands of customers, whether it's how they order, what they order, how they choose to pay and how they're served. And we want to be providing faster service for those customers that really want fast service. At the same time, not everyone wants to be rushed, and, therefore, we're providing more alternatives.","Chris's example of curbside is absolutely spot-on. Or maybe you're entering the restaurant and you've got a family with you and you just want to dwell a little more on the kiosk and just take some time ordering. So it's just a much more enjoyable experience. So I guess this is allowing the customer to have that range of choices. And then they can, therefore, if you like, self-select the way they experience McDonald's. And, as I say, where we are more advanced in the rollout of Experience of the Future, the customer satisfaction is noticeably higher. And Chris has already begun to see that in the U.S., which is encouraging, but, again, not surprising. We're confident in the plans we have.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff?","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Just following up on value quickly, so on recent calls, you noted that a few of the 22 U.S. regions have already been more aggressively pursuing, I think, it was the McPick options and combinations of $1 and $2 beverages. So I'm just curious how those three to four regions have performed on a same-store sales basis relative to the rest of the system and if that magnitude of out-performance can tell us anything about, potentially, what we could be seeing from value as we get into 2018.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. I think, as you know, with McPick, certainly this year, there was a heavy local element to it. So we had different regions pursuing different McPick strategies, both the price points that they would hit, but, frankly, also the items that they would be selling for. And so it's difficult to do the comparison that you're talking about because it's not just what item at what price point, but it's also where was the starting price point for that. In general, I think the point that you're making, though, is an accurate one, which is we think that we still had an opportunity to get more competitive on value.","Again, we're not trying to win on value, but we can't lose on value. And so I think what you're going be seeing from us going forward is really for us consistently to stay competitive on value.","And I think the other thing, as I mentioned earlier in the call, is more of that investment now going forward is going be done and driven at the national level than at the local level, which I think plays to our strength from a marketing communications standpoint where we can really drive that message.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens. Will?","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, guys. I had a question on the U.S. franchisee base. It seems there's been a fairly aggressive push to both improve, as you referenced earlier, and to naturally consolidate that franchisee base as a result of some meaningful investments required to get to an EOTF format or otherwise. So can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the current domestic franchisee base and how that may change over the coming years as some of this consolidation likely occurs?","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Sure. Well, so one, I think being relatively new to McDonald's, I'd say one of the things that has really been a highlight for me is getting to know our U.S. Owner\/Operators. And I'd tell you they're \u2013 it's a very impressive group in terms of what they're able to drive. And so you're seeing that in the results here. Our point of view, and certainly all my discussions with the Owner\/Operators in the U.S. has been I would love for every single one of them who's currently in the system today to remain in the system. And so there is no, from our vantage point, concerted effort to try to change the franchisee base or have it look different.","But that said, we do have expectations around performance. And, as you said, as we said earlier, running better restaurants is the foundation. And we were not consistently running the type of restaurants in the U.S. that we were expecting to. And so step one has been we have really level set what the standard is for performance in the U.S. At the same time, we've outlined a pretty, what we think is exciting and ambitious growth plan, but it is one that's going to require investment. And so as you put those two together, as you put together a performance expectation along with an investment expectation, we are seeing some Owner\/Operators are deciding now is a good time to exit the system.","And I think for us, while we certainly are sorry to see folks go, we would rather have that conversation where we're all operating from just a very transparent set of expectations.","So I think over the next couple of years, we're probably going to continue to see some evolution of this, but by and large I think the U.S. franchise system as you see it today is going be the same one that we're going to be talking about in a few years.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question is from Alton Stump with Longbow Research. Alton?","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you, and good morning. Just go back to delivery, it's actually still very early, of course, with the roll here in the U.S., but can you walk through what you're finding as to if there's any certain categories, whether if it's casual or if it's pizza or otherwise that you guys think you're gaining share from as a result of the rollout of delivery?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Delivery is already a significant market, and I guess the reason we've addressed this with such urgency is, apart from in certain Asian and Middle Eastern markets, we just weren't participating. And given societal trends, given consumer trends, we could only see it growing. So for us, we're a little late to enter, but I think we've entered with more muscle and intent than probably most other competitors could possibly match. I mean, you may have heard me say before but across our top five or six markets around the world, 75% of our customers live within three miles of a McDonald's.","So, frankly, there is no other restaurant business on the planet that's closer to more of the global population than we are. And we think that, therefore, that lends itself really well to not just visiting their local McDonald's but also having delivery from their local McDonald's.","What are the sort of trends we're seeing? We're certainly seeing it appeal to the younger consumer. We're seeing some great results around college towns. As I say, from a daypart perspective, we see it skew slightly later, so into evenings and overnights. There tends to be more group orders, so we see the average check somewhere between 1.5 to 2 times a typical average check in a restaurant.","So I think it really is beginning to clearly demonstrate to us that this is an incremental business for us. It's an incremental revenue stream for us. But we're learning with every day and every week and every market we bring onboard, each market we bring onboard now is just a little wiser than the previous one, because we're building up the experience and the knowledge. And we've also got an opportunity ahead of us that we've yet to be innovating around packaging, innovating around bundling different menu items, and other potential business opportunities further down the line.","I think our view was, let's get into the game. Let's show our intent. Let's learn really quickly, and then we'll continue this kind of progress over perfection mentality where we can fine-tune it as time goes on. But it's encouraging to us, and, as I say, you can expect us to move from about 8,500 restaurants today to probably north of 10,000 by the end of this year. And expect to see the trend continue.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim. Matt?","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I just have a follow-up question with respect to the margin comment in the U.S. I'm just curious as far as if I look at digital and I look at the Experience of the Future, it seems like some International markets and regions have been a little bit faster to roll it out, yet we didn't see that type of margin pressure or labor pressure. Can you talk about the dynamics in the U.S. that are now manifesting sort of this labor pressure? Is it with things that are already introduced into the store? Or is this a market that you have to invest in front of the curve where it's waiting then for the same-store sales leverage to flow-through beyond sort of the six to nine-month period that you said you were going to experience labor deleverage?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, Matt. I'll start, and then Chris can add more texture again back to the U.S., but I guess, one thing that's just fair to call out is when we went to the new segment structure, we did so because we wanted to increase the transparency and accountability of what's driving our business. So when we look, for example, at the International Lead markets, not all five markets rolled out at the same time. So, therefore, if one or two markets were feeling a little more margin pressure because they were at the front end, there was a couple of markets that hadn't really embarked on it, but who still had strong margins.","So, as you can see, that kind of impact got blended into a five markets segment result. Here, clearly, with the U.S., it's a segment of its own and, therefore, there's no other market to blend it into. But part of the way we're looking to manage this business, and we've said our geographic spread is one of our, we believe, competitive advantages of us as a business, we can have certain markets do some of the heavy lifting while some are investing through this cycle.","And, yes, ultimately, we are running this business for the long-term. And if there's a shorter-term impact, I would like to think we've demonstrated ourselves as being fiscally responsible as leaders of this business, but if that's the investments that are required to get the job done properly, then that's what we're going to keep doing. But, Chris, if there's anything more you want to add.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. And I think just to maybe give a concrete example, I mean, as we laid out 2018, we have a number of initiatives that are going to be hitting the market in 2018. One of the biggest ones, the first one that's going to be coming out is, we call it, hot off the grill. It's sometimes referred to as fresh beef. But right now, we're actually bringing on a number of regions onto this platform as we convert over our supply chain.","When we bring on hot off the grill or fresh beef into a market, we actually have a six week training curriculum that the entire restaurant goes through. And it's a very intensive training curriculum that they have to go to, actually starting with the operator.","The operator first goes through training, and then we literally take every single one of those crew members with both an offsite and then an in-store training experience. All the time that's spent on training for hot off the grill implementation, all of that counts against your labor and none of it is revenue-producing. But it's the sort of thing that we think is required to really make sure that when we do rollout hot off the grill that we execute it at a really high standard.","So that's just one example, but we have a number of other initiatives that have the similar type of training and preparation curriculum that's going with it that obviously puts a short-term burden on what needs to be done at the restaurant.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Greg?","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Can you just talk a little bit more about the European consumer? I know we've heard from some of your suppliers and also just generally in the industry, strength out of Europe. And I'm wondering, what do you think's driving that and maybe how sustainable that is?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Greg. I guess it's a mixed picture, and certain of the metrics that we see are somewhat contradictory to a certain degree. I mean, depending on which country you're talking, there's a little bit of nervousness in terms of consumer confidence. We're seeing consumer confidence in the UK get a little weaker as the uncertainty over Brexit continues.","I think one thing we do see more consistently, which is a positive certainly for society and putting money in peoples' pockets, is unemployment is typically declining across all of our major markets. And there's better stability and growing consumer confidence in France, and we're seeing the same in Italy as well. Germany continues to be a somewhat more mixed picture. But overall, we're not seeing any of these metrics as a significant tailwind, nor do we think we're kind of having to cycle-tread into a strong headwind, either.","I guess the reality for us, our mental approach in every single one of these markets is, let's assume there's only going to be very modest market growth overall. And, therefore, let's take the attitude this is a market share fight and you're going to either be winning or losing customers and let's make sure we're on the right end of that battle.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question's from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays. Jeff?","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. I guess Steve or Chris, in the U.S. QSR burger category, it seems like the largest players have most recently been sustaining or even accelerating momentum. And I know if you look back over the past decade or so, it has been historically very difficult to maintain that for a sustainable period. So I'm just wondering maybe what you think has changed in QSR or maybe the dynamic that's changed meaningfully. Or where do you think maybe the share is coming from that's led to this most recent resurgence across broader QSR?","And then, Kevin, could you just clarify what you said earlier? Just from an accounting standpoint, I want to make sure I understood. You said 20% equity pick-up with the China, Hong Kong shift. Just want to make sure, that's going flow through the equity and earnings line and just how much you might think that's going be starting this quarter or what we should think of as a run rate. Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I think three of us will have a go at that, Jeff, here's a multifaceted \u2013 if I give a broader perspective on the way that we're looking to grow our business is I'm not interested in the comp cycle. And you hear people talk about it and next quarter's comp will all depend on what the same comp was a year ago. And I think, ultimately, what we're looking at and we've seen it successful in a couple of our more mature markets, is build the platforms of growth that give you long-term sustaining growth, so you're not in that short-term cycle. You don't get dragged into it.","And Chris can talk to the QSR industry in the U.S., but certainly as we build our Experience of the Future, our digital platforms, delivery, convert the consumers to are somewhat more casual to our brand, we think that we're building sustaining platforms that are important for us, but, Chris, maybe the U.S.?","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. And so, I think just to build on that, it is a relatively flat market, but I think what we're seeing is that when you're really sharp with your proposition that you're offering the customer, the food that you're offering, the value that you're doing with the experience, when you've really got a compelling proposition to put forth, you can gain significant share. And so, certainly, the comp gap that we've been seeing, our comp gap has been widening over the last three quarters. And I'm very excited about what we've got in the pipeline going forward.","I think as I said at the opening of my comments, the absolute key for us is going to be to execute. But I think if we execute and, again, we stay really sharp with the proposition that we're offering customers, I don't see any reason why we couldn't sustain that performance, but it's on us to demonstrate it.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","And then, Jeff, regarding your question on kind of China, Hong Kong going forward, it'll be accounted for similar to how we account for Japan today, which is we'll get a royalty up in franchise revenues, and then we'll pick up 20% of their net earnings down in the line called equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates within our other operating income. So that's what it'll be beginning \u2013 I guess, a little bit beginning this quarter, but really beginning more next quarter. And then, regarding size of it, I guess, what I would remind you of is remember that China and Hong Kong in total were less than 5% of our consolidated operating income.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","So we have time for one more question and that will be David Tarantino with Baird. David?","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. My question is on your digital strategy. And, Chris, maybe you can comment. I think you mentioned that there's a building database of digital users. I wonder if there's any metrics you can share around that and where you expect that to go over time. And then, lastly, on the mobile order and pay adoption, specifically, I know it's early days, but can you talk about the adoption rates you're seeing in the restaurants you've had it the longest, and what you're planning to do to drive adoption as you move through next year? Thanks.","Chris Kempczinski - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Well, so I'd say we are still in the early innings, in honor of the World Series, in the early innings of digital, but we're seeing, I think, a really nice start to it. So we've had almost 30 million downloads. I would say we're roughly 9 million active users, meaning who are in it on a monthly basis that we're seeing there. And we're seeing strong offer momentum, which is really currently the primary benefit that we're delivering through the app.","As we're rolling out now mobile order and pay, the power is going be that to then bring together the offer with the ability to do mobile order and pay. Right now, what we're doing mostly in our restaurants with the roll out of mobile order and pay is we're really at this point focused on getting the operations right. So getting, for example, the crew to understand when a curbside order comes up, how do they take that order, how do they go out and bring the food to the customer. So, right now, I'd say we're spending a lot of time on mobile order and pay.","Yes, as we're deploying it, but really make sure we've got the operational muscle there, because what will happen then in 2018 is we're going to flip the marketing switch on it and start to drive really much more increased usage. But, certainly, we've learned from some of the other activity out there. We want to make sure that we're ready when we do flip on the marketing switch that we're ready to handle the business with it, but still early innings. We do think that it's a significant opportunity for us and we would expect in the future it becomes a more significant part of the comp.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","So we've reached the top of the hour. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing remarks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Very briefly, our Velocity Growth strategy is working. And you can see the proof in our performance. Even as we've made a lot of progress, we know we still have a lot more to do. We'll continue focusing our energy on aligning our entire organization around disciplined execution that will allow us to deliver on the full potential of our plans.","And with that, thank you for dialing in, and I wish you a good day. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call. You are now free to disconnect."],"13981":["McDonald's Corp.

Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Now, before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We had another good quarter of results as we continue to execute our Velocity Growth Plan. Our customers tell us they value and appreciate the moves we're making to elevate the McDonald's experience. As we discussed a quarter ago, we're confident in our strategy as we continue the day-to-day work of running great restaurants and as we put in place of the most promising platforms for long-term sustained growth.","Our International Lead markets offer an important illustration of the successful approach which reinforces the belief in our plan. Markets such as UK, Canada and France continue to perform well with strong sales and guest count growth. These markets began establishing the foundation for today's success several years ago. They developed realistic plans guided by rich local insights about our customers and initiated programs to offer delicious food, compelling value and great running modernized restaurants.","They also gained alignment with franchisees and enhanced engagement with restaurant employees, vital steps toward integrated and effective execution. The result is that our customers visiting these restaurants today can easily see our commitment to providing them with a great experience. With a solid platform in place, these markets also have been more effective in activating additional initiatives for growth, such as digital and delivery.","We've demonstrated our ability to transfer winning ideas across our markets and that's another reason for the continued confidence in our business. As I mentioned last quarter, the U.S. is in the first year of executing an ambitious and holistic three year plan aligned with the Velocity strategy. Many of the initiatives in the U.S. have been key drivers of the success in our international markets.","The U.S. business completed over 1,300 more Experience of the Future, or as we call it, EOTF, restaurant conversions in quarter two. While this aggressive pace comes with some limited downtime, it essentially means we're providing customers with an improved and modernized experience in roughly 10 additional restaurants every day. To-date, we have a total of over 5,000 EOTF restaurants, which is more than one-third of the U.S. estate, offering elevated hospitality and convenience to our customers.","While EOTF brings dramatic improvements to our restaurants, it is not the only major initiative the U.S. business executed during the quarter. We also successfully completed the rollout of cooked right when ordered quarter pound burgers using fresh beef, continued to redefine convenience with delivery and refined our value offering, including our $1 $2 $3 national value platform.","We know the combination of key initiatives to improve the experience for our customers makes a difference. Restaurant success saw in executing multiple elements of the U.S. plan are achieving high sales, guest counts and cash flow. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to join our U.S. President, Chris Kempczinski, and several hundred of our U.S. Owner\/Operators, who are meeting here in Chicago. We're not yet where we need to be with regaining more customer visits, and the front and center focus of the discussion was growing guest counts in our largest business segments.","Together, we're taking on a lot, and own Owner\/Operators are working with our U.S. leadership team on the greatest opportunities to strengthen and grow our business. The U.S. business recently made changes to its organizational structure to better support the way we work with Owner\/Operators to run great restaurants. We've removed layers from the field organization whilst increasing resources in key areas, such as technology and field consulting.","A key element of the restructuring includes providing more consulting and better support for Owner\/Operators we execute together on the many initiatives of our bigger, bolder Vision 2020 U.S. plan. We expect to see improved speed to market and decision-making as the U.S. becomes fit for purpose. And that better alignment enables us to provide a great experience for our customers and unlock the full potential of the plan. This gives a high level of view what's driving our business.","And now, we'll share details of our results for the quarter. Globally, comparable sales increased by 4%, during the quarter, marking our 12th consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Global comparable guest counts declined slightly during the second quarter, dropping by 0.3%. Guest counts grew in all of our international operating segments, but in the U.S., quarterly guest counts decreased from a year ago.","And now, Kevin will walk you through more details about our sales and guest count performance during the quarter.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Our strong global comp sales performance for the quarter reflects positive results in every business segment, led by the International Lead markets in Japan. This quarter also marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive guest count growth in all international segments.","Taking a look at the U.S., comp sales increased 2.6% for the quarter, with a positive GAAP of 90 basis points versus QSR sandwich competitors. A higher average check drove sale due to favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. The product mix shifts were a result of several factors, including a trade-up to higher priced items such as our fresh beef quarter pound burgers and $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu add-ons resulting in higher basket size.","An important part of our U.S. plan includes delivering a balanced mix of both higher average check and comparable guest count growth. As I just mentioned, we've seen positive benefits in average check. However, we remain intensely focused on increasing customer visits.","As we've said in the past, we must be competitive on value. We don't strive to win on value, but we won't lose either. With a sluggish IEO market and the introduction of our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu at the beginning of the year, we've seen our competitors increase their attention on deals. Therefore, we know that we need to be more aggressive to compete effectively. While our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu is driving incremental sales and guest counts with our budget basic value customers, we need to do more to attract other customer groups.","In addition to the delicious food that customers can get at a low price every day, we know that certain customers are looking for a great deal in the marketplace. We need to better meet the expectations of these deal customers and give them reasons to visit us more frequently.","As I mentioned earlier this year, while we will maintain our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as our everyday value platform, we'll also pulse in deal offers from time-to-time. For example, in second quarter, we featured the 2 for $4 breakfast sandwiches. And beginning in early August, we'll have a 2 for $5 Mix & Match deal with some of our iconic sandwiches that we know our customers love.","Turning to the International Lead segment, comp sales were up 4.9% for the quarter, with all markets posting positive comp sales and guest counts. The UK continues to lead the segment with high single-digit sales increases for the quarter. And continued momentum in France helped them achieve their highest-ever market share.","Comp sales for the High Growth markets increased 2.4% for the quarter, driven by both Italy and Poland's double-digit sales increases, partially offset by continuing challenges in South Korea. Our Growth Plan accelerators of digital, delivery and EOTF have been critical contributors to these markets' success. As our Experience of the Future incubator market, Poland is demonstrating what a difference it makes for customers when our restaurants successfully integrate all EOTF elements.","And across the Foundational markets, comp sales were up 6.8%. Each geographic business unit within the segment contributed positively to results, with continued strong performance in Japan leading the segment.","Now, I'll turn it back to Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. The philosophy strategy is working because it's grounded in evolving our business on the customers' agenda. McDonald's customers have high expectations that we will offer them great tasting food, value for money and an experience offering enhanced convenience. As we make significant progress in each of these areas, we are continuing to see customer satisfaction scores improve in most of our larger markets.","Our UK market, for example, continues to be one of our best performers as the market achieved robust sales again during the quarter. Sales were the second highest on record in May, and April set a best-ever mark for guest counts. Many elements are coming together to drive this performance. In addition to the success of iconic menu items such as the Big Mac, our Signature beef premium sandwiches continue to be popular with our customers in the UK.","France also found success with promoting sandwiches from the core of our menu, such as Big Macs, premium sandwiches like Le Big Tasty and the McFirst, a Petits Plaisir, which continue to provide customers delicious food at a compelling price point.","And, as I mentioned, the U.S. also made strides in improving the taste of our food. The cooked when ordered Quarter Pounders made with fresh beef are hotter and juicier. We're pleased with the high customer awareness and enthusiastic responses. Sales are up and market share gains indicate that within the large classic burger category, customers are choosing McDonald's more often.","Value is essential to what many of our customers expect from McDonald's. Kevin offered details earlier about the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu and how we're optimizing the U.S. value platform. Our markets across the world also have value at the core of their strategies, utilizing extended always-on, compelling everyday value platforms plus rotating deals.","We are finding that the McDonald's mobile app is an increasingly effective way of extending appealing deals to our customers. We've talked previously about markets successfully using a digital activation approach that customers appreciate, with daily deals offered over several weeks or a month.","Our velocity accelerators are continuing to gain traction and contribute to our business. They represent significant opportunities to enhance the customer experience with greater convenience.","Today, I'll offer up an update about the progress we've made with the delivery accelerator, the business impact we're seeing and what we expect in the future. The delivery market continues to grow. With the power of proximity, McDonald's is well positioned to be a leader in delivery. Across the globe, there are more than 1 billion people living less than 10 minutes from a McDonald's. That gives us a significant advantage in quickly bringing delicious food to our customers in their homes, offices and college dorms.","We've been moving at a pace that is unprecedented in the McDonald's System. Last July, delivery was available in about 7,800 McDonald's restaurants around the world. We've continued expanding and now delivery is available from more than 13,000 restaurants through 60 markets on 6 continents. Customers are responding.","Delivery's becoming a meaningful contributor to our sales. And in several of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. Delivery requires virtually no additional investment and is tremendously effective in bringing profitable and incremental guest count. We're continuing to see delivery orders of about double the size of the standard restaurant average check.","Our biggest opportunity remains in driving awareness. When more customers learn they can get their favorite McDonald's food delivered right to their door, we're confident we'll see delivery sales continue to grow.","With McDelivery Day earlier this month, we celebrated the success of enhancing convenience to our customers with delivery. During the day, we engaged with customers around the world and saw a surge in delivery activity in the markets participating in the campaign. In the U.S., for example, we had the highest number of delivery transactions ever in a single day.","We were also able to leverage our FIFA sponsorship during the World Cup to raise awareness about delivery. A number of our markets, including Portugal and the UK, ran fun and effective promotions that reinforced the convenience of delivery.","Our strong relationship with Uber Eats is one of the reasons delivery has been so successful for our business. Over the past year, we've worked effectively with Uber Eats to optimize the delivery process. We've taken steps to protect the quality of the food as it travels from restaurants to our customers and improved operational efficiencies so orders are delivered as quickly as possible.","We're continuing to work closely with Uber Eats to elevate the customer experience and introduce marketing promotions that should stimulate even more growth. Delivery, like other elements of velocity plan is contributing to our success now and offers untapped potential for us to capture in the future. We'll look forward to sharing updates as we make additional progress.","Now, Kevin will discuss more financial highlights from the quarter.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.90, a 9% increase in constant currencies. These results include $92 million of strategic charges, primarily related to reorganizing our U.S. business unit, which Steve mentioned earlier.","Excluding these charges and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share was $1.99, a 12% increase in constant currencies. Business performance from comparable sales growth offset the impact of refranchising, while the quarter also benefited from a lower tax rate.","As I talk about our operating performance, I want to remind everyone that our second quarter results are compared against results last year prior to refranchising China and Hong Kong. This was the most significant refranchising transaction in our history, which we completed last July.","As I've mentioned in the past, we measure the efficiency of our business by our operating margin and this serves as a comprehensive gauge of our overall performance. We've taken significant steps to capitalize on the strengths of our business model, achieve efficiencies with our G&A and stabilize our P&L, all of which are yielding significant benefits to our operating margin as we continue to progress towards our target of mid-40s. Year-to-date, our operating margin was 42%, up from 37% last year.","The largest and most important component of operating income is our franchise margins, as over 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars now come from our franchise business. For the quarter, every segment grew franchise margin dollars, led by the International Lead markets, while global franchise margins totaled nearly $2.3 billion, a 9% increase in constant currencies.","Refranchising benefited the quarter, along with positive comp sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to our EOTF partnering contributions in the U.S.","Consolidated company-operated margins declined 80 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter. That decrease was primarily driven by continued labor and commodity pressures across key markets.","Moving on to pricing and commodities, second quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up about 2%, which was below food away from home inflation of 2. 8%. Commodity costs in the U.S. for the quarter were also up around 2% versus last year. For the full year, we continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase 1% to 2%, as we anticipate commodity cost pressures will lessen in the fourth quarter.","For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were also up about 2% for the quarter. And we expect commodities to be up a similar percentage for the full year. ILM menu prices averaged about 2.5% higher year-over-year.","Continuing on to G&A, G&A for the second quarter increased 2% in constant currencies as a result of higher restaurant technology spending, along with costs associated with our worldwide convention in April. We continue to expect our full year G&A to decrease about 1% in constant currencies.","Our effective tax rate was 26% for the quarter. While we may have additional adjustments this year as the guidance on tax reform continues to evolve, we still expect our full year tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range.","Finally, looking at foreign currencies, EPS benefited $0.05 per share for the quarter due to foreign currency translation. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar and based on current exchange rates, we now anticipate FX will be a headwind of $0.02 to $0.04 for the third quarter, with a full year FX benefit of about $0.07 to $0.09. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year.","Now, I'll turn it back to you, Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","The momentum in our business shows that the Velocity Growth Plan continues to gain traction. We're still in the early stages, and we're confident there is plenty of growth left in this plan. We recognize in the U.S., we're experiencing the challenge of a highly competitive environment while executing an ambitious and complex multiyear plan. We know we have a strong and an agile leadership team and committed Owner\/Operators working together and moving quickly to take the right actions for our business.","While we focus on business performance, we also continue to take steps that strengthen our brand. During the quarter, we completed the transition of entirely moving our global headquarters from the suburb of Oak Brook to the heart of Chicago. We marked the occasion with a grand opening in early June, when we were able to honor current and former leaders of our company who have done so much to help build the McDonald's brand.","This move has continued to energize our teams as they experience a more open collaborative environment in our new headquarters and enjoy the dynamic neighborhoods of such a vibrant city.","Also in June, we generated brand excitement with our customers as we moved forward with the first in a series of cross-promotional campaigns in the U.S. with Disney. We featured Happy Meal boxes and toys themed with Disney's summer hit movie Incredibles 2.","As you can see, the broad-based success across our business illustrates the strength of our overall approach. We look forward to sharing additional progress in the months ahead. And I will hand it back to Mike and we can take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Thank you, Steve. We'll now open up the call for analyst and investor questions. Now, the first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to just ask about the emphasis on value. And I guess twofold, one is to the extent that maybe the value platforms that you had the beginning of the year weren't quite as strong as they needed to be, I guess are you confident that you've gotten ahead of that now because presumably there will be competitive response to anything new that you bring out?","And the second question related to that is the issue tension with franchisees, because, again, it seems pretty apparent that value was going to be a very competitive space. But your McOpCo margins have come under pressure. So I wasn't sure if maybe that's what has kept you from being more aggressive.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Hi, Sara. I'll take that one. Here's what we did. As you know, at the very start of the year, we launched the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu and that was established as our kind of everyday entry value level. And we always said it was going to take us a quarter or two to fully be able to analyze consumer response to see the dynamics across our business, whether it was from a top-line sales, whether it's from guest count and also the margin implications.","We continue to be confident that platform is resilient and is delivering what we expect it to do. However, I would say because we have been aggressive, we have seen more competitive activity in the area of value broadly. We've been able to decompose our trading performance to actually analyze the opportunity we believe we have in the area kind of meal deals. That's where the competition has been particularly strong.","So we believe that the $1, $2, $3 entry level, if you've just $1 or $2 in your pocket, it works. If you want to add on to your meal combinations, it works, whereas the meal deal element where we think we need to be more competitive. And both Kevin and I steal from the phrase that Chris Kempczinski uses with the U.S., which is we will remain competitive on value. We're not looking to win on value. We will remain competitive.","I can tell you as recently as this week, and having spent a good deal of time with a few hundred of our leadership Owner\/Operators, we were able to analyze the detail. We're able to galvanize ourselves together. I'm not going to give a whole heap of detail about it, but you can expect us to be reactive and far more agile in the way that we respond in the marketplace. And the Owner\/Operators are absolutely consolidated and behind that decision because they want to grow guest counts because they know that's the ultimate lifeline of our business.","So is there work to do? Yes. Are we happy with where we're at right now? No, not entirely. Are we confident that we've got the right plans in place and the support from the entire U.S. Operator system? Entirely. So we're going to keep pushing on and competing hard.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles - Cowen and Company, LLC","Great, thanks. You called out 90 basis points outperformance versus quick service peers versus a roughly, call it, 200 to 400 basis points level you had been running over the last five quarters. And so, you kind of touched on it a little bit with the meal deals, but what do you attribute to a narrowing of outperformance versus quick service peers as Q2 did offer compelling value between $1 $2 $3 and the two for $4 breakfast sandwiches?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I would say we're taking share on a sales point of view, but we're not taking share on the guest count. So I mean, it still comes down to driving the guest count. So yes, we put some activity in the marketplace. What we are looking to do, I mean, there's a number of initiatives that we have agreed upon across our U.S. business. So, for example, when you look at our breakfast performance overall, that's an important part of our overall sales mix, as you know, and it's been a stronghold for us for many, many years. But we've just begun to lose a little bit of share at that daypart, in particular.","And, as we've also explained in the past, we have changed our approach to how we market across the U.S. We moved a little bit more out of the local marketing dollars into the national marketing. We believe, for example, that for getting the breakfast share back, that's more of a local market activity. The tastes and wants of consumers around the U.S. are pretty vastly different at that breakfast daypart. Some are: coffee-led markets that are food supported; others, food-led markets that are beverage supported. So we believe putting the power back into the local co-ops is the right way to go.","So, yeah, there's multiple facets to it. We have taken share on the sales level for 72 of the last 78 weeks in the U.S. and that's a trend we expect to continue. We want to get the traffic share back as well. So we want to be greedy. We plan to be greedy and win on both sales and guest count and that's where we're galvanizing ourselves around.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question will be from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. Just touching on the company-operated and, I guess, maybe more importantly, the franchise profitability, I think you said all constituents are behind you in terms of being more nimble. But with the continued pressure on labor and, I guess, to a lesser degree, food costs, it seems like you want to keep pricing below food away from home. But do you think the franchisees are okay with the near-term margin pressure or do you think maybe that this inflationary environment is unusual and, therefore, justifying a further bump in the pricing, whether or not that's on premium or still keeping the value? I'm just trying to gauge the franchisee sensitivity to this aggressive value push and their profitability.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, Kevin, can certainly follow up. I'll have the first stab at this one. There are multiple dimensions to what grows, obviously, cash flow. And, at the moment, the average check growth is strong. Not a lot of that's coming through pricing. A lot of it's coming through mix. With the increasing take-up of customers take-up self-order kiosks, we get a higher average check there. As we continue to roll out delivery, we get twice the average check there.","So I'm not so concerned about the average check increases as long as it's not being too forceful through just price itself, because the consumer is still sensitive out there. People are a little tentative. They're a little cautious and you got to stay in line.","We are very transparent with our Owner\/Operators. We engage with them day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month. And we share with them exactly what they can expect from food costs and commodity increases, and what we can expect from utility increase, what we can expect from new product margins. I mean, would we all like to grow income? Well, of course.","Are they still entirely unified behind the plan we have and believe in its long-term strength? Absolutely, right. And there's nothing we want to do more than grow operator cash flow, because that's such a great motivator for future investment and future confidence. So in the immediate term, they are pragmatic, but we certainly have a desire to be growing, not just our own income and margins, but also their cash flows as well.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next up is Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just following up on the conversation, you kind of keep saying this thing on value, that you don't want to win on value, you just want to be competitive, but I think, arguably, a large reason why sales trends have been so solid for extended periods is because you've been winning on value.","So I guess the main question is, why not have a strategy to continue to win on value? Is it because of the margin structure of value and the headwind it presents for franchisee profits? Or is there some other reason why you don't want to necessarily win on value moving forward?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, I'd slightly dispute the fact that the sales growth has come from winning on value. I think it's been multidimensional. I think, yeah, we're selling more premium products at the top-end of the menu with the Signature Crafted.","When you have a investment in a restaurant, we see the pickup in sales from the EOTF conversions, which are still delivering what we have seen elsewhere in the world. When it's a full modernization EOTF here in the U.S, we're getting mid-single digit sales uplifts. When it's just adding the EOTF elements on modernized restaurant, we're still getting 1% to 2% uplift. So I think there's multiple levers at play that are driving the top line.","And the reality is, we are looking to build a moat around the business. And the more we invest in food quality, the more we invest in our employment proposition and enhance services, the better the technology relationships we have with our customers, the more modernized our restaurants become, the harder it will be for people to compete with us. And therefore, we're not intending to lead any race to the bottom here. We just want to be competitive on value. And I retain that and we stand behind that.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next caller is David Tarantino from Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. A couple questions about the U.S. comps, so, first, could you talk about how the launch of fresh beef did relative to your expectations prior to that launch? And then secondly, I was wondering if there were factors outside of this value discussion that might have hurt the comps in Q2. And specifically, lower throughput following the launch of fresh beef, given the operational change there or disruption from the remodeling activity, if you could just comment on those last few factors as well. Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah. Again, I'll try and address these as best I can, David. So, fresh beef has been a significant operational rollout for us. Let's, first of all, just recognize what we're doing here. Really it is a material change to the operating system on our largest beef patty. And the great news is because the buzz became so strong, the awareness levels at launch were around 80%, which is kind of way on the top end of any sort of promotional or launch activity you can normally expect. Consumer sentiment has been really high. And we believe we're taking share in that sort of bigger burger sort of category.","That said, it has been a slight operational complication to us. It's added a few seconds to service time. The teams are on to that. I mean, first of all, there's familiarity in a restaurant, which will help bring that down. But also, we're looking at other things we can do to simplify the operation to help bring our service times down. So I think there's a marginal increase, particularly in the drive-thru. It's less of an issue in store. It's almost mainly through the drive-thru. And our teams are looking to address that. Go on, Kevin.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","I'll take a little discussion on EOTF downtime that you mentioned, David. I guess, just to give a perspective, EOTF downtime, obviously, depends on exactly what we're doing in any particular restaurant. But roughly, a week, five to 10 days or so, would be kind of normal downtime. But you also have to think about there's a little bit of an impact on what I'll call collar days, kind of right before and right after that. So that you actually get a little bit more impact than just the days it's down.","Now, that does have an impact on current quarter comp sales, guest counts and margins, because, as you would expect, labor becomes a little bit less efficient when you have a week of downtime. So those stores that go down do have some near-term impacts. I think it may be a little bit more than we even thought, I think as we're getting into some of the projects we want to make sure we're doing all the right things and getting in once and getting it done right.","We feel pretty good about when they come out of that downtime, though, when they reopen, what we're seeing is the markets or the restaurants increase sales similar to what we've seen internationally, which is the mid-single digit sales for people who do a full remodel and, obviously, less than that for people who just add the EOTF elements.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Just to add to that as well. I mean, yeah, we're a large business and sometimes our numbers can be in millions and billions. And kind of, we just get used to that. I want to put in context, we converted 1,300 restaurants in 90 days. And that means across that quarter, 14 or 15 communities are waking up every day to a dramatically modernized restaurant and a much better experience.","So is there a little drag through this conversion period? Yes, there is but I wouldn't swap it for anything because the upside for the long-term, actually the medium, but also the longer term, is so evident to us, as is evidenced by the performance out of Canada, out of UK, out of France, out of Germany, out of Italy, out of Spain, out of Poland. We know these are sales kickers and sustaining sales growth. So we'll take a little short-term bit of pressure on that, but we're unflinching in our desire to modernize the estate here in the U.S. And I'm proud of the team because 1,300 restaurants in a quarter is quite remarkable.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on U.S. store margins, in prior quarters, you've talked about some pretty explicit almost one-time investments in training and getting the stores ready for a lot of the initiatives that are in the pipeline. Could you give us a little bit of color for what that sort of investment or what that sort of pressure in the quarter could have looked like?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, thanks, Karen. I think that pressure is dissipating. We now have fresh beef in all of the locations. So certainly, you would have seen for the first half of the year for several months of the year, some training and investment as we were kind of ramping up to get fresh beef in everywhere. I'd say that's starting to dissipate.","Now, we will still see it here and there as we do EOTF restaurants, because once a restaurant goes through EOTF, it generally takes a little bit of time to settle back in kind of normal because it is a change for the restaurant also. So we'll see some of that continue as we convert EOTF. But I'd say overall, the overall investment, if you will, is starting to dissipate from where it was at the end of last year, beginning of this year.","From an overall margin side, I'd say labor costs continue to be a pressure. Commodities this quarter were still a little bit of a pressure. And that EOTF downtime, as well as depreciation, will be another pressure in the near-term as we go through these EOTF projects.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Good morning. You've talked about this gap, right, of either in the U.S., who's done it early, or the international markets that have done Experience of the Future or value delivery, et cetera. And it's at the higher comp than what the U.S. comp is. So how important is the field management streamlining and change and support you can offer the franchisees in closing that gap and capitalizing on these opportunities?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","So that's a great question. I'll take that. I mean, the reality is building a strong aggressive multidimensional plan is one thing. Executing it is everything. So what Chris and the team have done is taken a look at how can we best reallocate our resources to where it's needed most. And we are now in execution mode. And I tried to paint that picture a little bit last quarter and you can expect me to continue paint it probably the next six or seven quarters, in all honestly. We're in execution mode.","Now, we will finesse the plan a little bit along the way. We'll be agile. But fundamentally, we know have the right drivers in the right place. And what we want to do is best support the Owner\/Operators and help them execute to the highest level. And I typically said I will take an 80% quality plan executed 100% every time over a perfect plan that's executed 80%. Because ultimately, it's the customer experience that really, really matters.","So the reorganization and the reallocation of resources to help get stability and consistency into our technology platforms to make it easier to run the restaurants, and also just provide that consulting support. We've got project management offices set up. We've got what we call tiger teams that will go and find the little hotspots anywhere and just help with the execution. Actually, it's the boots on the ground, experienced field consultants who can help support and guide the Owner\/Operators through this quite a significant transitional phase that we're going through. That's the whole purpose of it. And I'm confident that it's really going to be well received by the Operators and they're excited to receive more support.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens Inc.","Yeah, thank you. I had a question on the International Lead markets and other growth markets as we could maybe translate those to what's happening in the U.S. or what may happen in the U.S. Can you talk about the evolution of average check and guest counts that you've seen over time as you've undergone modernization and various value initiatives in those international markets and now, obviously, we're seeing some benefits of those? How should we translate that success to what we're seeing in the U.S. and maybe what potentially we will see?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well I think it does differ by market because the competitive environment differs by market. But if I was to take a broad swipe at that, I would say historically, what we've tended to see and, again, this is a generalization. With sales growth, typically around half of that over time has come from guest count growth and about half from average check. And the majority of the average check growth has typically come from pricing.","What I do tend to see now in the International Lead markets is, yes, there's absolute guest count growth. Actually, the average check growth is a little higher, but not because of pricing. People will price in line with the market, in line with food away from home, in line with the competitive environment. But once you get those platforms in place, you tend to be able to leverage more at the premium end of your menu.","As I mentioned before, the more customers that choose to order through the self-order kiosks tend to dwell a little longer and spend a little more because the average check's higher there.","And as we roll out initiatives such as delivery, we're getting an average check kicker there as well. So I think what we'll tend to see is we still want that guest count growth. It wouldn't surprise me if the average check growth becomes a little more significant than the guest count growth, but we just absolutely not want to do that through price. It's really through leveraging the investments we've made. And once you get that quality base in place, that gives you a lot of opportunity to get your mix right, your basket size right and customers tend to do a little more and spend a little more.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Alton Stump with Longbow.","Alton K. Stump - Longbow Research LLC","Thank you and good morning. Back to your comment about the breakfast first half of the year, outside two for $4, both your platforms, $1 $2 $3, of course, fresh beef were certainly an indicator focused on, of course, the lunch and the dinner dayparts, So I think by your comments I understand the fact that a lot of it should be local marketing. But is there an opportunity from a national perspective to put more focus behind your breakfast offerings during the back half of the year?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, I can take that or start that, Alton. We talked about breakfast has been a little bit of an opportunity for us for a little while. I think one of the things that happened was breakfast was really carried locally, primarily last year. And we kind of had an abrupt change at the end of the year where were really moved almost all of it to national. And so I think what we've been spending the last several months is just make sure we have the right balance. You will see there's obviously breakfast products on $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu. As we've talked about, we will likely tweak $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as we go through the year, so you could see little changes. So there will be a big piece of breakfast that is included in the national platform, the $1 $2 $3.","But in addition to that, we need to make sure that we carry some important breakfast messages locally, because there is a difference, certainly maybe even more so in breakfast than other dayparts, places like the South that really like biscuits. It's going to be very different than the Northeast or Northwest. And so, we just need to make sure we've got in the night national value platform related to breakfast as well as the right local messages that can resonate with the individual local customers in each place.","The only other thing I'd say is breakfast guest counts remain negative. So we still got an opportunity for that. We did have positive comp sales in breakfast in the second quarter. So we have seen at least a little bit of the trend start improving. We still have a lot more way to go. But we did see breakfast comp sales finally positive in the second quarter.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, I think you can also probably at a national level, expect to see us continue to invest and support the McCaf\u00e9 brand more broadly. I think that has national \u2013 a universally supported nationally across the U.S. with our stripped coffee or the more premium coffees now with the investments we've made in quality equipment. So, I think that one lends itself to national, but certainly food-led breakfast in particular, we think is a more localized support, as Kevin has already have mentioned.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. I just have a housekeeping one and then another question. Just on the 4,000 remodels you're doing this year, how many of those are full versus partial? And then, of the ones you're going to have left after this year, how many of those are going to be full versus partial remodels?","And then, my other question is just, Steve, you talked about the average check being driven more by mix. Is that a conscious decision you're making to take the brand a little more upscale over time or is that sort of not how you're thinking about it?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","I'll take the first one.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Okay.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","The question about how many are modernized versus non-modernized or full versus partial, as you called it, I'd say this year should be relatively representative. It's about a third of what you'll call full are the complete and then about two-thirds of partial or where you just need the EOTF elements. We will probably and we're a little more skewed to McOpCo probably this year, so about half of our McOpCo estate or company-operated, are complete at this point. So it may be a little bit more front-loaded on the company-operated sites. But in general, it should be similar between the about a third full and about two-thirds partial this year and going forward.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","With the second half, no, I wouldn't describe it as a conscious effort to take the brand up-market. I mean we don't want to alienate anyone. And we will always stand for value. But as we continue to invest in the brand, as you invest in quality and the properness of our food, you invest in the physical real estate, as you invest in technology, what you tend to do is broaden your customer base.","So I think really what we end up doing is appealing to a broader range of customers on more occasions, more often. That's what it's all about. We want to do the things that positively impact the most people in the most areas as possible, but I wouldn't say it's a conscious effort to take the brand up-market. Continuing to reinvest in the brand and keep it relevant for customers today is what it's all about. And it's a competitive marketplace. We want to differentiate ourselves from the competition and we believe we have some initiatives in place that will help broaden the gap between us and the others.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you. I just have a follow-up on that and then also just want to know about \u2013 I know you don't like to talk about current trends, but there's been some news about these salads and things like that. I was just curious how that might have been resolved, impacted or how that might manifest itself in trends. But you also just mentioned about alienating a customer. Obviously, I don't think you purposely would want to ever chase away people. But could you sort of narrow down the drag that was referred to from the conversion? Is that manifesting itself in less frequency, you think, from your customers, or could you narrow that down to a specific cohort maybe of that lower income demographic that perhaps the value message has been a little bit diluted as you've been elevating the brand? And they could come back or have you just seen simply less frequency from your existing customers?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I'll take the salad one. Yes, I mean, obviously, I mean, food safety and the customer's well being is our absolute number one priority, first and foremost. So, as you know, we've been contacted by the public health authorities from Iowa and Illinois about certain infections across produce in those states. We have removed existing lettuce blend from the identified restaurants. It impacted around 3,000 restaurants, but as of July 23, so when was that? That's three days ago. All those restaurants have been fully replenished with a new supply and we continue to trade fully. So I wouldn't say that has a material impact on our trading performance. It's something you don't want to be associated with, so we take it very seriously. But from a trading perspective, it really hasn't been something that is particularly material.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","I'll take the second one. I tried talking in my script a little bit about kind of these two different customer groups. There is one customer group that we call, or that are called, budget basics, that are really looking for kind of everyday predictable low prices. And our $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu has been successfully dealing or addressing those customers. Where we've had a little bit of gap, if you will, is these deal customers, who are people that love fast food, but they will go to several different outlets based on who's got the best deal or who has a really compelling deal. And I think that's the area where we haven't been as competitive as we've needed to be because some of our competition has stepped up on their deal side.","And so we've talked about we need to make sure on the deal side that we're competitive so that those customers are \u2013 that's where we would have lost, I'll say, some frequency of customers, as you talked about. So it's really just having those customers come back to us more frequently because we've got the compelling deals on a regular basis.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Two on comps, first, just on the global comp or the global traffic, it declined for the first time in several quarters. And I know you called out the U.S, but I'm assuming U.S. is somewhat similar, at least on a comp basis, versus last quarter. So are there other international markets where traffic is still positive but maybe has decelerated worth calling out? I know you said South Korea. But are there other places that you're starting to see some traffic deceleration that would account for that global deceleration in traffic?","And earlier this year, I think you reduced the advertising spend in the U.S. as part of the rollout of the $1 $2 $3 Menu. Do you think that's at all a root cause of perhaps some of the weaknesses or said another way, is there a need to reinvest in some advertising dollars in the U.S. as a way to drive traffic?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I'd say from a guest count perspective, I mean, clearly the U.S. has come to be our largest market. And therefore, if that goes weak or goes negative, that tends to drag things down. Other somewhat more noticeable trends over the last, I would say, three months to six months have been China, where we're still getting like-for-like sales growth, but the guest count growth has gone negative in China through the quarter. The impact within that market on the uncertainty of the trade discussions has \u2013 I mean, clearly, it's hit the markets, which, in turn, hits consumer confidence. And so, we're keeping close to that and adjusting our plans, so we can be competitive there.","And Russia continues to be hard work for us. So we're getting negative guest counts there at the moment and now we're making some changes with our team there, but also with our strategy there. So we can compete slightly more fully.","On the advertising side, you're right. We reduced the contribution here in the U.S. for both Owner\/Operators and the company. I don't think our issue is around the percentage contribution. I think what it takes is a little bit of time, that when you move from 180 co-ops down to 56 co-ops, when you move from 44 local marketing agencies to a roster of five local marketing agencies, there's just a transition time for it to settle down.","So are we running at peak performance year-to-date in terms of just the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing? Probably not. Do we believe we have the structure in place where the contribution we make now, we believe should be certainly sufficient from a share of voice for internal marketing spend and, therefore, basically be more effective and more efficient? So there's no plans to change the marketing contribution. It's just what we do with it, which is most important.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. I know you don't comment or maybe can't control, I should say, staffing levels for franchisees in the U.S. or what franchisees pay their labor, but I just want to have a sense of the overall staffing environment that the franchisees are facing on a market-by-market basis and if you think the current labor market in any way is affecting some of your execution levels that maybe you alluded to in terms of fresh beef being a little bit slower through the drive-thru or any other factors in terms of processing peak hour transactions.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, John, it's Kevin. That's a good and fair question. I'd say labor staffing, it's a tight labor market out there. I think it's fair to say. And so, labor staffing is a challenge, both for us and the franchisees. But that's the industry. So I don't know that we have it any worse than anybody else. And I don't know that we can or should or do use that an excuse. I do think it is a tough labor market right now to make sure you've got the right staffing levels. And maybe because we're going through EOTF and all these other things right now, that you see a little bit of impact of that. But long term, we have to figure out that equation.","We've got to be able to figure out how to be efficient with our labor and be able to operate effectively. Near term, I think it's a fair point. You know unemployment is obviously very low. And so, certainly, depending on state-by-state or area-by-area, it does have an impact. So we're trying to do everything we can to invest in our employees, to invest in training to make sure that we can attract the right labor force. But it's a challenge right now in the industry, I think.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","I think part of what we're doing because there is a fight for talent and it's not just the U.S., actually. It's in a lot of our mature markets, partly because there is less mobile labor. Let me put it that way. So there's less migration across Europe. With the impacts of Brexit, means there been an exodus of, if you like, service sector workers out of the UK.","We can begin to see that impact here in the U.S. So we've got to fight that little bit harder to first of all, gain the talent and then retain it. So that's why we committed $150 million over the next five years to Archways to Opportunity, for example. We're actually providing education and training opportunities and career development and personal development opportunity to our people. So whatever we can do to try and differentiate ourselves from others in the service sector is really important to us right now. So we're doubling-down on, if you like, the added value that we can offer our employees as well as the day-to-day hour-to-hour work.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.","Chris O'Cull - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Kevin, it sounded like from your comments that the D $1 $2 $3 Value Menu may evolve to include some regional variation. I wanted to see if that was true. And then, also, is the plan to design local meal deals to be more competitive in lower cost markets where you see competition priced to that local market rather than a national level?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, Chris. Let me try a couple of things there. D $1 $2 $3, it's a national platform. There are and will be some options, if you will, that local markets, depending on where they are, can draw down and put on the $1 $2 $3 Menu. So you will see some items that are on in certain markets, depending on where they're located. So the general platform is national. There will be certain products that will be on nationally. But locally, people will have an option of, I'll say, either adding or swapping out a couple products, here and there.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Deal.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","The second part about deal, most of the deals will likely be national deals, so things like the two for $4 breakfast that we had. The two for $5 sandwich that we're going to have starting August and other deal platforms that we are anticipating, will generally be national platforms. So I think most of the deal will be at a national level.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Okay. We've got time for one more question and that will be Matt McGinley with Evercore","Matthew Robert McGinley - Evercore Group LLC","Thank you. My question is on the International Lead and looking at the level of comp you've had over the past handful of quarters and then looking at not a whole lot of margin flow through. Given your farther along with EOTF, and I don't think the investment levels are the same there, but I believe delivery is becoming a bigger part of the mix there. I'm curious if that could be having a bigger drag on the comp than perhaps other initiatives or other investments that you're making. And if that sort of spend continues, do you think that that same level of overall rule of thumb in terms of the comp growth would have the same level of impact on the earnings on a go-forward basis?","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yeah, Matt, I'll take that. I'd say we're really pleased with the comp growth that we've been getting in the International Lead markets because it's been pretty broad based. You see all five of the main markets in that International Lead segment doing pretty well. They're all in pretty good shape with Experience of the Future. Some of them, Germany and France, probably have a little bit ways to go, but the restaurants look really good. We're getting sales.","In general, those markets, I guess from our perspective, we're throwing up franchise margins of 81% and McOpCo margins this quarter of over 21%. So I think, in general, we're pretty pleased with the level of margin.","Now you do see a little bit of percentage hurt, I'll say, because of delivery, to your point. As delivery percentages and sales grow, the percentage margin on those is a little lower percentage because you've got commission to pay. But I'll certainly take the additional dollars we're getting from those sales to give up a little of that percentage. So I think we're pretty pleased with the margin flow through in those International Lead segment.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","All I'd say on some of that is we're taking share in each one of those markets as well. So, yes, we want it to carry to the bottom-line. But from a competitive position perspective, we just got stronger and stronger compared to the rest. So it's the share gains, we know, are the long-term winner for us. But they are returning pretty good profitability and some great top-line and solid guest count growth as well.","Mike Flores - McDonald's Corp.","So that completes our call. Thank you, everyone.

More specifically, growth in the informal eating out industry has been relatively flat to declining around the world and we expect that to continue.While 2012 was a challenging year for a number of reasons both within and outside of our control, we remain focused on stabilizing and growing market share in the near term, while continuing to lay the foundation for sustainable and profitable long-term growth.For the full year, we continued to grow market share in Europe, APMEA and the U.S. amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable traffic.Now as I share our results for the quarter and the full year, I also want to provide a perspective on how we've adapted our plans as we strive to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink.System-wide sales grew 5% in constant currencies in 2012 where total comparable sales up 3.1% for the year. Comparable sales for the quarter and the month of December were essentially flat. As we begin 2013, we face persistent top and bottom line pressures and significant prior year results. As a result, we expect January sales to be negative.In constant currencies, operating income grew 4% for both the quarter and the year while earnings per share increased 5% for both periods. Even though our 2012 performance was softer than recent years, we've adapted our plans to be more aggressive and continue to build on the gains that we have made. This will ensure that we drive long-term value for our system and our shareholders, despite the pressures of the short-term environment.We have a resilient business model and aligned system and experience in every type of operating environment around the world. Our long-term average annual financial targets in constant currencies remain intact and are appropriate for a company of our size and maturity. They keep us focused on making the best decisions for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.This past year, we met our long-term system-wide sales growth target of 3% to 5%. Full-year operating income growth came in below our target of 6% to 7%. Our performance was impacted by heightened global operating challenges along with planned G&A investments that pressured the bottom line. And while our one-year return on incrementally invested capital is not yet final, we expect it to be in the mid to high teens.As we begin 2013, we're placing an even greater emphasis on those drivers that excite consumers and generate the greatest growth for our business. We still have plenty of room to grow within the framework of our plan to win and our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden the accessibility to brand McDonald's around the world.For example, our menu strategy provides exceptional value at every price tier by offering an affordable entry point and leveraging mid tier and premium products to encourage trade up and a higher average check. We've also intensified our focus on the fundamentals in areas that are hallmarks of our brand including operations, service, leadership marketing and merchandizing. And we're placing an even greater emphasis on scaling successes even more quickly around the globe.The answers are definitely in our system and are driving our plans in every area of the world. From compelling menu offerings like McWraps, to winning value and convenience initiatives, to our beverage business, extended hours and new restaurant developments in both established and emerging markets.So I\u2019ll start with the U.S. where comparable sales increased 0.3% for the quarter and 3.3% for the year. For the same periods operating income was relatively flat and up 2% respectively. Because we experienced softer performance in the second half of the year, we adjusted our plans to reenergize our menu and value offerings. We focused on entrees with the introduction of the new premium Cheddar Bacon Onion Sandwich in late October and the return of the popular McRib sandwich in December.We also leveraged the news of our new NFL and Pro Bowl partnerships to remind customers about a classic favorite, it\u2019s our juicy and tender all white meat chicken McNuggets, by featuring the 20 piece McNuggets for $4.99. And we brought excitement and variety to the dollar menu, adding the new Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger at the end of December.Now our menu pipeline is more balanced in 2013. We will be introducing Fish McBites soon and later in the year, will debut new beef sandwiches, chicken entrees, breakfast and beverage offers that are demonstrating strong customer appeal in the test markets.We also refocused our advertising to enhance support for value in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll continue these efforts into 2013. The marketing calendar will balance large scale food events, compelling value, ongoing on-trade news and strong local activities.In addition to the menu and marketing efforts to play a big role in our 2013 plans, we\u2019re staying focused on meaningful service enhancements that improve customer satisfaction and our service levels. We are also expanding our peak hour performance to capture even more visits and broaden our accessibility.Now let\u2019s turn over to Europe, where comparable sales were down 60 basis points for the quarter and up 2.4% for the year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year. Europe was a solid contributor to bottom-line results even with the effects of the debt crisis and our sturdy measures impacting consumers. While low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect retail sales and the IEO visits, we outperformed the market and grew market share by 10 basis points to 9.2% year-to-date November. Our performance can be attributed to three drivers, enhanced value messaging, trading customers up to premium products that they know and love and new product news.Our base value initiatives are essential maintaining and attracting new customers, that\u2019s why many markets have reintroduced value either with new news or by evolving existing value platforms to be even more appealing. In France for example, we\u2019re advertising the new Casse Croute sandwich and drink combo for \u20ac4.50 nationally. And in Germany we\u2019ve enhanced our McDeal value bundle to include two new entr\u00e9e choices. Meanwhile the U.K. continues to be a bright spot in the region and this is a great example of how we\u2019re executing premium office to resonate with our customers. Its strong run of premium food promotions included the Bacon, Chicken & Onion food event which began in the fourth quarter and will be featured in France this year.Across Europe we also continue to build the capacity of our existing restaurants through extended hours and by leveraging technology such as the new power system, self order kiosk and handheld order takers. Europe is a region that is right with opportunity and we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize on this region\u2019s long-term potential.Now let\u2019s shift over to Asia\/Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were down 1.7% for the quarter and up 1.4% for the full-year. IEO visits have declined across most markets and we\u2019ve seen a slowdown in eating out behaviors overall across APMEA. In constant currencies operating income declined 1% in the fourth quarter, but grew 3% for the year.Now like the rest of the world, APMEA experienced a challenging year of economic pressures. Consumer confidence remains low, partly due to Japan\u2019s uneven recovery and China\u2019s slower economic growth. As markets review their menu offerings for the final months of the year and into 2013, they focused on leveraging seasonality, local relevance and favorite limited time offers to both mitigate the softness and balance their value and premium platforms.In Australia, the start of the summer campaign featuring new Smoothie flavors and compelling limited time offers including lamb sandwiches and wraps drove sales and traffic. And to further reinforce its value messaging, Australia is re-launching its Loose Change menu this month with a new national program designed to drive guest counts and average check.Now while Japan's results were the primary factor in APMEA's negative comp for the quarter, the 100, 250 and 500 yen value offerings drove guest count increases and market share gains within a contracting IEO marketplace. As we begin 2013, Japan is focused on building average check in two ways; through trade-up opportunities with promotional products and through its focus on breakfast.In China, comparable sales decreased 0.9% for the quarter and increased 3.2% for the full year. While the recent chicken supply industry issue minimally impacted our fourth quarter results, the heightened consumer sensitivity around this matter is negatively impacting our sales into 2013. We are committed to ensuring the highest foods safety and quality standards are met around the world.We remain focused on growth check in the market by building on China's value position through a blend of menu news and convenience initiatives. In addition, a new web ordering system that enhances the customer experience lowers the cost of operations and drives new demand as being scaled across China. Already in more than 500 hubs this system is helping broaden accessibility across China through delivery.We also opened 256 restaurants in China last year making significant progress toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013. Around the world, we have a strong foundation on which we continue to grow. Our business, our brand and our financials remain strong and we will keep building upon them.As our business grows and continues to generate significant levels of cash, our first priority is to reinvest in opportunities to grow the business for the future. Our second use of cash is our dividend. Last September, the Board announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.77 per share in the fourth quarter. Our third and final use of cash is share repurchases. In 2012, we returned a total of $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.As we begin the new year, I'd like to reiterate my confidence in McDonald's. Our system alignment is strong. We're determined to leverage our strengths to attract more customers, to gain even more market share and fortify our financial strength. Our plan to win is strong and we continue to aggressively pursue the growth opportunities within our three global priorities to optimize the menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald's.We have made the tactical adjustments that are necessary to navigate through the current environment while continuing to deliver value for the benefit of our system and our shareholders over the long term.Thanks and with that, I'll turn it over to Pete.Peter BensenThanks, Don, and hello everyone. The McDonald's system remains focused on executing the proven strategies behind the three global priorities of our plan to win. In both fourth quarter 2012 and for the full year, this translated into growth in revenues and earnings per share despite challenging market conditions.We've continued to manage our business for the long term and are confident in our business model and hard earned competitive advantages. McDonald's has a long history of profitable growth in a variety of economic and competitive cycles. In the near term, we do not expect significant changes in the macroeconomic or competitive environment though we remain focused on those things within our control. This includes a 2013 plan designed to maintain and grow market share along with investments that solidify our foundation to drive future growth and returns.In 2012, combined operating margin declined 40 basis points to 31.2% and continues to compare favorably to other large global consumer companies. Restaurant margins are the main driver of our combined operating margin. With about 80% of our restaurants franchise, the largest component of our overall profitability continues to be franchise margins.In constant currencies consolidated franchise margins increased 3% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and 6% to $7.4 billion for the full-year, with every area of the world contributing. The consolidated franchise margin percent declined 20 basis points for the quarter and was flat for the year at 83% and sales performance was offset primarily by higher occupancy costs including depreciation.Consolidated company operated margins representing about 30% of total restaurant margin dollars declined 90 basis points to 17.8% for the year \u2013 for the quarter and fell 70 basis points to 82 to 18.2% for the year. Sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor and commodity costs in both periods.Moving on to segment performance. In the U.S., we [led] [ph] steep comparable sales increases in fourth quarter and faced higher costs across most expense categories, resulting in a 150 basis point decline in Company operated margins to 19.5%. For the full-year margins declined 110 basis points to 19.5%, as 4% higher commodity costs as well as increased labor and occupancy expenses more than offset sales gains.Price increases are used to mitigate inflationary pressures. It is critical to maintain our value proposition by keeping price increases at or below key inflation indices. At year-end, our U.S. price increase was about 2%, which is slightly less than the food-away-from-home increased for the year of 2.5%. A conscious decision was made not to replace 75 basis points of pricing that rolled off in November in light of this slight decline projected in 2013 IEO traffic. And with projected 2013 food-away-from-home inflation of 2.5% to 3.5%, we want to maintain pricing flexibility as we balance future price increases with our desire to continue to grow traffic and market share. We expect the U.S. commodity cost to increase 1.5% to 2.5% in 2013. In addition labor and depreciation are expected to continue to pressure margins.Turning to Europe, for both fourth quarter and full-year 2012, sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor and commodities. Company operated margins declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 20 basis points for the year to 19.1%. Commodity increases of 2% in fourth quarter and 3% for the full-year negatively impacted margins. Europe\u2019s margins once again benefited from solid performance in Russia and the U.K. which together represents nearly 45% of Company operated margin dollars in Europe.Europe\u2019s full-year comparable sales gain was driven entirely by pricing and product mix. At year end, Europe\u2019s price increase excluding Russia was about 2.5%. On the expense side we expect commodities to increase 3% to 4% in 2013 along with continued pressure from higher labor expenses. Despite these near term challenges, including an IEO market projected to be relatively flat to declining in 2013 our business in Europe remains solid, as this is our fundamental operating model. We remain focused and reigniting traffic growth through a balanced approach of enhanced value offerings and compelling premium products. Menu innovation including premium products remains an area of focus. With nearly all of our interiors and over half of our exteriors re-imaged premium products often merchandized around promotional food events have proven to be appealing to European consumers.In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa several key markets including Japan, Australia and China enhanced their value platforms in 2012. This resonated with consumers as we served over 1.2 million more customers per day versus the prior year. Looking to 2013 we will strive to build on our traffic gains while encouraging trade-up and add-on purchases to boost average check and overall comparable sales.In addition to compelling value, many of our markets offer key conveniences including delivery and drive-through. Convenience also means being available to customers when they need us. Nearly two-thirds of our restaurants in APMEA offer some form of extended hours and over half are open 24 hours.Relative to profitability, APMEA's company-operated margins declined 190 basis points for the quarter to 14.4% as negative comparable sales along with higher labor and occupancy costs pressured margins. For the year, company-operated margins declined 140 basis points to 15.9%. The acceleration of new store openings in China continued to negatively impact APMEA's margins in both periods.The final component of combined operating margin is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased 4% for the year less than previously forecasted due in part to lower incentive-based compensation and lower than planned spending on IT acceleration. The overall increase for the year was primarily driven by about $90 million of spending on our Olympic sponsorship, technology enhancements and the biennial Worldwide Owner\/Operator Convention.As a percent of sales and revenue, G&A was flat versus the prior year. As we look to 2013, we expect G&A to increase about 2% to 3% in constant currencies. I want to briefly comment on the increase in other operating income. As part of our overall refranchising efforts in Europe, Canada and China, we've recognized higher gains from sales of restaurants in both fourth quarter and the full year. We continue to seek strong, committed local franchises using both conventional and developmental licensees' structures.McDonald's continues to generate significant cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our business to continue growing and generating strong returns. This is accomplished through a balanced measured approach of adding new restaurants and growing sales at existing locations. In 2012, we further modernized our brand through opening 1,439 new restaurants and reimaging about 2,400 others.Full year 2012 capital expenditures are not yet final but we expect them to total between $3 billion and $3.1 billion. This increase from our $2.9 billion estimate is a result of several factors including an increased number and scope of some of our U.S. reimaging projects, timing of projects and cash payments and overall increase in the number of new openings in all areas of the world.In 2013, we expect to invest about $3.2 billion over half of which will be used to open 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants. The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segments is as follows. 220 openings in the US, 290 in Europe and 850 in APMEA including about 300 new restaurants in China. The remainder of our CapEx will be invested in our existing locations, including reimaging more than 1,600 restaurants globally.Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.01 and full year EPS by $0.17. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2013 EPS to be minimally impacted between zero and negative $0.01 and expect full year positive impact of $0.04 to $0.05. As always, please take this as directional only because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year.As we begin 2013, we are mindful of the challenging comparisons we have in the first quarter as well as the ongoing pressures on both our top and bottom lines. I'm confident in the adjustments we have made to fortify our near-term performance while remaining focused on the larger opportunities over the longer term.McDonald's has earned significant long-term competitive advantages in size and scale. We are uniquely well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities within the $1 trillion global informal eating out industry where our market share today is less than 9%. McDonald's has a strong history of creating significant value for shareholders over time and we remain committed to continuing to do so in the years to come. Thank you.Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Kathy Martin","Great. Thanks, Pete. We are going to now open the call for Analysts and Investor questions. (Operator Instructions) So we\u2019ll start with Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Great. Thank you very much. I have a question about just your guidance for 2013 for that the 6% to 7% operating income growth. It clearly assumes that your sales do recover nicely, but we\u2019d also assume, I guess, is that you can better leverage the sales growth than you have recently and really increase the margins here. And I just \u2013 it seems as though they could be somewhat of a challenge, there is still margin headwinds and even on kind of low single-digit same-store sales growth, it could be tough for the franchising company margins to really improve. So, if you could just give us a little more color on the confidence in that 6% to 7% operating income growth, given what seems to be some margin headwinds, how are you going to be able to better leverage sales growth, if it does recover?Don ThompsonHi, Brian. Thanks much for the question. I will comment on this first one and Pete may have something to add. What I would say Brian is we absolutely believe that our 6% to 7% operating income guidance is the right target for our growth over the long-term. And as we say throughout 2012, we firmly believe that what we\u2019ve to do is appeal to more customers, we got to appeal relative to top line growth, we got to have a variety or stronger variety and a stronger pipeline that\u2019s executed in the various markets. We believe we definitely have that going into 2013 and feel better about the robustness, if you would, with that food pipeline.We know also that these are \u2013 2013 is still going to be a tough economic environment around the world. We know this in Europe, we know it in APMEA, in the U.S. we\u2019re seeing some signs of maybe a slight recovery, however, having said that we also know that we have commodity pressures and some labor pressures. So by no means do we intend to state that 2013 is going to be an easy year. However, we believe our target 6% to 7% are the appropriate targets. We believe our plan to continue to focus on food, in the menu, to modernize the customer experience, to continue our re-images, to continue to grow relative to the opportunities in new markets around the world. We believe those things would help us to be effective in continuing to build the business.Kathy MartinOur next question is from Keith Siegner, Credit Suisse.Keith Siegner - Credit SuisseThanks. The question I want to ask is about December, by all means on a two year trade day adjusted basis was a very strong month, one of the best of the year despite Japan\u2019s weakness. When looking at the January guidance for a slight negative while still very strong, was a slight slowdown and I know you don\u2019t usually like to get into regional breakdowns, but even at a qualitative basis is, if there\u2019s anything you think you could offer is this, is some of that coming from the U.S. is the payroll tax maybe playing some role in this, any regional kind of qualitative data you could give us on January it would be very helpful. Thanks.Don ThompsonHey, Keith. As you know Keith, based upon last year we had a very strong first quarter. In that first quarter we were \u2013 we experienced sales that were up 7.3%. We had success across markets. The U.S. was particularly strong clearly. Europe was very strong. But as we move into 2013, we also know that we\u2019re comping against those success factors. We rarely talk about things like weather and the fact that where Chinese New Year shifts around. So as long as we continue to talk about the entire first quarter we know we\u2019ll see some shifts from a January into a February relative to the Chinese New Year, but it won\u2019t affect the overall quarter. So we believe that as we move into, as we talk about our first quarter sales, that the first quarter sales will mute out many of the things that were \u2013 that shifted around during last year.Having said that, it was a 7.5% -- as I mentioned it was a 7.5% or 7.3% comp in the first quarter of last year, and so we know we\u2019re going up against that, it\u2019s going to be fairly tough. In the first quarter of the year we do see a shift from a Chinese New Year perspective out of January into February, so we know that that\u2019s going to be a part of that. We believe the plans that we\u2019ve seen are solid plans, but nonetheless we still face some economic challenges around the world.Kathy MartinThe next question is from David Palmer from UBS.David Palmer - UBS Investment BankHey, guys. If I can throw in a little one on China. Is the consumer reaction there to that chicken supply issue diminishing or is it still as bad as it has been? My major question though is on reimaging. When you factor in the reimaging, the new build for relocation and reimages, what percent of the system is now done and where do you think that percentage will be in a year, what lifts are you seeing and do you think that that outperformance continues into year two after reimage such that we might see accumulative increasing benefit? Thanks.Don ThompsonThanks, David. Why don't we have Tim Fenton give a perspective relative to the chicken supply issue and then I'll ask Pete to talk a little bit about reimaging.Tim FentonHi, David. First of all, safety of our food is always top of mind for our customers, it's one of our priorities. We have strong procedures in place McDonald's China for testing all of our products. We test all batches of all of our raw products that come through our doors. So a very little impact in December as a whole, maybe seeing a little bit more, but it's really an industry-wide situation or broad based country-wide chicken industry issue that we're experiencing in China right now.Peter BensenAnd David, as far as reimaging, in the U.S. we closed the year at about 35% complete on both interiors and exteriors. Europe was a little over 90% done on the interiors. As you know, they started sooner and over 50% on the exteriors. And APMEA is about 60% done on the interiors and close to 50% on the exteriors. You saw in our guidance that we're actually reducing the number of reimages in 2013 relative to 2012. Part of that is because of the substantial progress we've made in a lot of these countries including Canada which we typically don't break out separately as well as the conscious decision I certain markets China being one to redirect some of the capital toward new store openings. As far as the sales performance, it continues to be strong and within our expectations and as we get more and more history, especially in the U.S. it's the data I'm most familiar with, we're actually seeing the second year incremental comp sales stronger than the first, so that benefit continues to grow. I think as the trade area and customers get used to the new environment and the more modern and relevance surrounding in addition to some of the more investments we do to improve the efficiency like the dual drive-through, sales just continue to build over time. So it's going to continue to be a part of our strategy and we're really happy with the results.Kathy MartinNext question is from Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman SachsSo U.S. restaurant margins have declined for two consecutive years now and the pace of declines has accelerated and it's about 100 basis points or more in each of the last two quarters. My question is, is the recent increased focus on value exacerbating the issue at all? And separately, are there any initiatives that you're looking to put in place for 2013 to help stop the slide?Don ThompsonHey, Michael. Just a couple of things relative to the value piece because we get asked this question quite often. The first thing I'd say is that in the US, keep in mind, we always had the Dollar Menu. What we did towards the fourth quarter of \u2013 in the fourth quarter of last year was really go back to advertising the dollar menu more because we had shifted our media weight over to the Extra Value Menu. So we took it away from Extra Value, put it back over the Dollar Menu. If you look at it from a percent of sales perspective, the Dollar Menu is still in the 10% to 15% range. Typically, we say 13 to 15 is still in that range, so it has not gone up by some substantial amount, as a result of us going ahead and advertising the Dollar Menu more so in our media. I will also say that the way that we're advertising Dollar Menu now is more consistent with how we had done it in the past and we got away from that in the second and the third quarters of 2012. So that really is the difference relative to the Dollar Menu piece.Peter BensenAnd one of the things we're doing, Michael, to \u2013 you asked about enhancing it, one of the things we're doing in late December we added the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger which was another reason to visit the Dollar Menu adding some excitement and some new news as well as putting a product on there that actually is better from a food cost perspective.Kathy MartinOur next question is from Mitch Speiser, Buckingham Research.Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.Great. Thanks very much and you\u2019ve answered a lot of my questions in the prepared comments. Just on the cash flow, which there isn\u2019t a lot of data on \u2013 in the press release. The share buyback was a bit lower in the fourth quarter, your dividend payments, I think, are now exceeding share repurchase. As we look at 2013 and given the increased CapEx budget, should we expect any change in trend in share repurchase activity?Peter J. BensenHey Mitch, you know regarding the quarter, typically the fourth quarter is our lowest share repurchase as we tend to have our dividend increase in the quarter and we spend a significant portion of our CapEx in the fourth quarter. So you typically see our share repurchase less. As you point out, the dividend continues to increase, that continues to be a greater portion of our free cash flow, but we remain committed to our strategy of returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time.Kathy MartinOur next question is David Tarantino from Baird.David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.Hi. Good morning. I wanted to come back to the 6% to 7% long-term operating income guidance and my question centers around 2013, you\u2019re coming off the year in 2012 where you didn\u2019t had that guidance for the first time in recent memory. So, I wanted to ask what your thoughts are and your ability to hit that in 2013 and specifically maybe talk about the degree of difficulty this year relative to the degree of difficulty last year? Thanks.Don ThompsonThanks, David. Let me just reiterate something that I mentioned in the formal comments and that was in 2012 we did meet our long-term system wide sales growth target of 3% to 5% in constant currencies. And so from a top line perspective, we did have growth that was in line with what our expectations were. Also keep in mind, in 2012, that we had some additional G&A investments that were made, incremental G&A investments that we made around several things. One was the Olympics another was an incremental investment in technology, we wanted to really establish a NewPOS technology system, which will help us operationally around the world in a stronger fashion. And then clearly we also had our owner operator\u2019s convention. We had several things that came into play. So, I wanted to make sure that we also put that in perspective. If you were to net those things out we would have still came in at about \u2013 we would had about a 5% growth in constant currencies, and so first is just the level set, that\u2019s very important.The long-term targets that we've established are exactly that, they are the long-term average targets that we believe are viable for our business; so the 6% to 7% is that long-term target. We also know that one year doesn\u2019t change our strategy. One year will not change our results. We don\u2019t think that there\u2019s been a fundamentally enough shift for us to change our targets as we move forward, and we think that the plans that we have around the world are strong enough and viable enough for us to again move toward and achieve those targets.Kathy MartinThe next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.John Glass - Morgan StanleyThanks. First if I could just ask you to clarify the commentary around January. Was this \u2013 is this a global I mean, every region phenomenon\u2019s negative or is this specifically driven, you highlighted Chinese New Year and some other issues. Is it really just APMEA and maybe you\u2019ll see other regions as being better or slightly positive, because in the U.S. you would \u2013 really saw a trend change in December, I guess -- we\u2019re all trying to figure out if that\u2019s an anomaly, that\u2019s just a clarification. And then the margin question, in the U.S. food inflation is going to be half the rate it was in the last two years and it sounds like you\u2019re going to price a bottom line with inflation. So why wouldn\u2019t that be a relatively positive sign, if you could maybe just hold margin in \u201913? I understand sales depending to some degree, the sales cooperate you could hold margin for the first time in a couple of years?Peter J. BensenHey, John its Pete. On January it\u2019s not our practice to get into the regional breakout of that. So, we need to get the month behind us and I\u2019ll give you all the texture and commentary when we release in early February. As far as the U.S. margin goes, you hit on it \u2013 it\u2019s really a top-line game. So well yes we\u2019re going to experience some relief in the commodity side. We\u2019re still going to have a shrinking eating out market based on the most recent projections anywhere from 20 to 50 basis points are the forecast I\u2019ve seen. So in that environment it makes it even more challenging from a pricing perspective to recover all of those input costs. So once we get passed the first quarter, which is our toughest comparison, I want to believe that the comparisons and the margin performance will be less pressured than it was in 2012. But until we really see an expansion in the consumer environment and the eating out market, the margins will continue to be challenged.Kathy MartinOur next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.Jeffrey Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.Great. Thank you very much. Just kind of moving more towards Europe, seems like the value focus has been in place now over the past few quarters. Just wondering whether in your view it's reasonable to assume that the goal to stabilize traffic kind of at the expense of average chicken margin was a success and as we look to '13, maybe should we see benefit from some trade backup to whether it be core or premium menu as you guys have alluded to in the past, therefore a return to perhaps positive comps and margin expansion in Europe. It seems like Germany and France are the areas where color would be helpful? And then just as an aside, you mentioned extended hours in each region in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on where we stand on extended and 24 hours in each market? Thanks.Don ThompsonHi, Jeff. I'll touch base on the frontend and then I'm going to ask Tim Fenton to talk a little bit about what he's seeing relative to some of the plans from \u2013 some of the markets across Europe. If we go back to 2012, one of the things that we mentioned is that we needed to really institute a stronger value messaging in France and in Germany. We had one that we felt fairly strong about in Spain. We needed to really initiate a stronger value platform in Italy. And so that was kind of the way we entered into 2012. We do feel much better relative to having had France make many steps forward which Tim can talk a little bit about relative to their value enhancements. In Germany, Germany is a tough environment from a consumer perspective. It is, as we've always mentioned, the most cost sensitive from a promotional perspective. We have some things that we've been doing there with the 3.79 meal deal, but there's some other pieces that have come about that Tim and the team have looked at relative to France and Germany. So do we feel like we've established value platforms across Europe? Yes, much more so than when we were in 2012 so it won't demand the same level of trying to implement value. But now what we've got to do is make sure we're reinforcing some of the other parts of the plan. And so Tim has been meeting with the folks and going over plans recently, so Tim\u2026Tim FentonSure. Well, there's some headwinds obviously in Europe. Decreasing consumer confidence I think it's been at the all-time low since they've been tracking it. IEO continues to contract, however, Europe gained market share for 2012. France, base back in the second quarter put much more emphasis on some of their value initiatives that they had with petite pleasures, just started and Don alluded to the Casse Croute, in France about 10 days ago which is basically a baguette and a drink for \u20ac4.50, just started 10 days ago with advertising, so we really don't have a lot of input on that. And as far as Germany, the McDeal started back in June which is two EVM's for \u20ac3.79 and just been the most price sensitive country we have as well as shifting some of our focus, our GRPs on our SMS which is equivalent to like a Dollar Menu that we have here in the US. So tough nut, we're working at it. The good thing is we're coming from a position of strength as far as market share, as far as sheer voice, physical plants, operations, so it's a strong case for us moving forward.Peter BensenAnd Jeff, a quick update on the 24 hours. APMEA leads the system with 60% of their restaurants at 24 hours. The U.S. is at 44% and Europe is at 26%. And all of those, it continues to be a focus as we talk about broadening acceptability being one of our three global priorities operating more hours continues to be a focus in all of the markets around the world.Kathy MartinYour next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.Jason West \u2013 Deutsche Bank SecuritiesYeah, thanks. Just one quick one on Japan if you could talk a bit more about what you're doing to turn that around. Is that really just a broader market issue or is it something you can do there to change the trend and when that might happen? And just bigger picture on the CapEx and the growth outlook, Don, you guys are kind of pushing a little bit harder on unit growth again and you're not changing your long-term EBIT growth number, so it does suggest the returns could be under some pressure, could you just talk about the decision to ramp up growth when you\u2019re seeing some issues with margins? Thanks.Don ThompsonTim, you want to talk about Japan?Tim FentonYeah, Jason its Tim. First of all, I think Japan is probably where the most competitive markets we\u2019ve right now with \u2013 in the IEO, and it is a declining IEO market. In spite of that, again Japan is gaining market share in 2012. They\u2019re also strategically working \u2013 moving away from some of the tactical promotions or discounts they would had and if you look in 2012 \u2013 2011 was right on the 40th anniversary, so that moving away from the tactical to more of a strategic value, it revamp some of their dollar maneuver or 100 Yen man use to go with 100 to 250 and 500 and to really try to address the erosion that we\u2019ve had in average check. We had good guest counts growth. We\u2019ve just lost an average check with some of the new premium products that we\u2019re bringing into.Don ThompsonAnd Jason relative to CapEx, I know you referenced ramping up. It\u2019s not really a ramp up. What we have established is a long-term development strategy. It is a part of the overall plan to win in one of the three global priorities and to broadening accessibility. Our goal is to be able to grow to the real opportunity that McDonald\u2019s has out there, and we think that we do clearly have some opportunities there. What we don\u2019t want to do Jason is getting to an old habit that we had, which was we start developing and maybe the economic environment will get slightly more difficult, so we slow down, we ramp up the teams and the resources and ramp them down. We were inconsistent in growth. We changed that in China. We\u2019re now looking at markets that are higher opportunity markets around the world to be able to ensure that we have a steady consistent plan, strategic growth as we move forward.And on the CapEx, be specifically I ask Pete to make a couple of comments there.Peter J. BensenYeah, I mean, Jason the increase in unit, we just take the mid-point of our 2013 guidance. It\u2019s a little over a 100 increase in units. More than half of those are coming out of China and we talked about the opportunity there and the strategic importance to growth there. Europe\u2019s another 30 of those roughly. In places like Russia, Italy, Spain where again as Don mentioned, the opportunity continues to be large, and over the last couple of years we\u2019ve worked on building our pipeline of sites and we have a very strong pipeline and feel very confident that this is absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term future.Kathy MartinAll right. We have about 12 people left in the queue, so I\u2019m going to ask you to try to stick to that one question. So our next question comes from Joe Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill LynchThank you. Pete, I want to stay on the CapEx side for a moment. You referenced in the G&A in the fourth quarter the acceleration in the IT slowing a little bit, and it sounds like you\u2019re shifting resources away from re-models towards new units, and I am not sure where the IT plans fit in, in that. Has that been slowed a little bit as well, and maybe just talk about the pros and cons of moving to new unit development over remodels if that\u2019s the choice you\u2019re making?Peter J. BensenJoe, the slowdown in the IT acceleration really was more impactful to G&A than it was to the CapEx. And the slowdown really was just a shift. So we had identified the plans that we have and just as things softened a little bit at the end of 2012 we made a conscious decision to slow down a little bit on that, and so we\u2019re continuing to focus and that\u2019s primarily as you know rolling out our new POS system and doing some things around our financial and HR systems around the world. Those continue to be a focus. We\u2019re just pacing that slightly differently.In terms of the CapEx, as Don mentioned this is growing to market opportunity. So it's not \u2013 we\u2019re going to get 2.5% of our sales growth in 2013 from unit expansion and that\u2019s half of our 5% kind of top-end target. So this is not really a dramatic change or shift. And again if you think about more than half of that increase coming from China where we know the long-term opportunity is huge and again that comment it's very important that Don made, it's very hard to start and stop new restaurant development, and you can't use one year\u2019s results or one year\u2019s pressure on margin to make a quick and short-term decision that has a negative impact to the long term. So we worked hard these last couple of years to build the pipeline, to improve our tools, to improve the unit economics such that when we open these restaurants, they're opening at good volumes around the world. So we continue to think that's absolutely the right thing to do and will be beneficial over the long term.Don ThompsonJoe, also the need does shift a little bit. If you look at Europe, we're over 90% complete with the interiors. Australia is fully reimaged. And so when those markets don't need the level of reimaging capital, then we are able to be able to deploy and strategically deploy some of our capital to the new opening opportunities as long as those opportunities are within the plan and we view those opportunities as viable growth opportunities for the future.Kathy MartinOur next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.Howard Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk ManagementThanks very much. I wanted to address the U.S. business if you don't mind and I know all the data is not in for the fourth quarter and I can't see the informal eating out market, but if I benchmark yourself against some of the other competitors that we can see the data for, it doesn't look like you're actually gaining market share. And I know a lot of these concepts are nipping at your butt in terms of copying your menu and narrowing the gap in terms of look and feel of the restaurants with yours. I'm just wondering how you are responding and I say that, I know you're not going to respond to certain competitors actions but it certainly feels like the industry is coming closer to where you are and there haven't been there in the past. So I'm just wondering how you look at things from a competitive standpoint and what you do to maybe widen that bar between you and the competition again? Thanks very much.Don ThompsonHi, Howard. I'll take the first part and I'll ask Tim to speak a little bit about some of the things he's seen relative to the U.S. as they just went through again plant reviews. But overall, here's what I would say to you. Clearly from the year of 2012, we grew market share in the U.S. and so we feel good about that. Howard, clearly as we came to the latter part of the year or in the third or fourth quarters, we felt some softening and some slowing ourselves and make some adjustments in the plan a couple of things we needed to do stronger. We need to have and execute, we had it but execute them more robust menu pipeline for our consumers and that's across the board in beverages and beef offerings and chicken offerings and I feel good about that and Tim will expand on that a bit. We needed to be able to reestablish value. We were kind of in the middle of a place that was not good. We were between Extra Value Menu and Dollar Menu. We have an iconic property in terms of Dollar Menu to be able to put the advertising and the weight back there and add some creative juice to that is what we wanted to do, and so I think those things were archived in 2012. So, now as we move into 2013, we've got to take those to the next level in menu and being able to make sure that we secure even more customers. So, with that, and knowing that we have to make sure that we don't price ourselves out of consumers' pockets. Tim and the folks from the U.S. with Jeff Stratton now had been focused on that. Tim?Tim FentonYeah, Howard, actually in December we had a positive 1.1% gap versus our competition after being slightly negative in October and November. I think what we feel really good about coming through the last meeting was our pipeline as Don mentioned in his -- for new products in his new comments is much more robust than it was this time last year. We've got over 180 products. We can pull from our menu globally and we found that a lot of these products, they travel quite well and I guess a good example would be the CBO that we just ran in the fourth quarter which came out of Europe, was very successful for us. Chicken McBites came from Australia. But we have a lot of things in test. Beef chicken, breakfast items, beverages and snacking that was again more robust than we had at this time last year.Kathy MartinOur next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.Matthew DiFrisco - Lazard Capital MarketsThank you. Just looking at the other income line, it looks like that was a big benefit, unexpected benefit and it looks like your -- it was from gain on sales of restaurant businesses in Europe and Canada. Curious is this something that is also going through 2013 as far as maybe more of a contributor, as I think it was basically a third of the contribution to the EBIT expansion year-over-year in dollar terms. And then this sort of goes into the \u2013 also it \u2013 along with those lines, below the line for your guidance for \u201913, I\u2019m just curious have you changed your position Pete, as far as the technology expense it appeared as though, entire costs you were saying \u201913 was going to be flat with \u201912, that wasn\u2019t going to be a source of leverage and now there are some number shifting. Is technology going to be more of a weight on G&A? I guess, this is just going to help us all understand, I\u2019m trying to figure out is the guidance of 6% to 7% long-term for EBIT or is it actually for \u201913 as well? Thank you.Peter J. BensenAll right, Matt. A lot wrapped in there. Other operating and \u2013 that number is we \u2013 its I don\u2019t want to say its hard to predict, but it does depend on transactions and activities around the markets, around the world. The primary source of that as you pointed out was refranchising in Canada, a couple of markets, in Europe and China. And so specifically China that was a combination of about four DL transactions and some conventional franchising. That activity will continue in 2013 as well as some limited refranchising, some of the other markets, but it's hard to give an exact prediction on where that number is going to be.Regarding technology let me clarify. So, when we first started 2012, we indicated that we expected about a $100 million of incremental spending, about half of which was going to be related to the Olympics in the convention and half of which was related to technology. And that going into 2013, we did not expect the extent of growth in the technology to be the same in 2013 as it was in 2012. And part of what we\u2019re experiencing here Matt is as we scale back some of that spending in 2012; we\u2019re now by default having some additional spending in 2013. On top of a slight acceleration in the pace of NewPOS rollout and some of that spending that we did \u2013 that we made in 2012 and prior was capitalized on the balance sheet and results in additional amortization expense. So, it is up slightly in 2013, but because of those two issues and not because of a change in strategy. And as Don mentioned in his remarks regarding the 6% to 7%, we don\u2019t give annual guidance, but those are intended to be long-term annual targets for our business and targets that we feel comfortable are appropriate for a company of our size.Kathy MartinOkay. We\u2019re starting to run out of time, but we\u2019ll take Jeff Omohundro from Davenport. You\u2019re next on the queue.Jeffrey Omohundro - Davenport & CompanyThanks. Just a quick one on the U.S. in the pacing of new products, given the change of leadership. I just wonder if you give some details around plans to speed up pacing across the barbell and if so will there \u2013 how soon would that \u2013 would we see that during 2013? Thanks.Peter J. BensenHi, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Relative to pacing of change across the barbell, we've got -- and again I mentioned we need \u2013 we have a solid value platform. We just needed to talk about it and make sure that it was top of mind for consumers and I think we\u2019ve begun to do that and reiterated our position there. What we\u2019ve got to do is make sure we have that other side of the barbell and that\u2019s the entr\u00e9e side of the barbell and ensure that, that is going to be \u2013 we have new entr\u00e9e news in beef and chicken across the year. I will also say that we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re talking about our beverages. We've done quite a bit on the McCafe line-up to ensure that this is a viable growth vehicle for us into the future. So you will see more news about that. And lastly you\u2019ll see some news about breakfast, and so all of those things are going to be rotated through if you will the calendar in 2013.Kathy MartinOkay, we\u2019re going to take four more because I know we\u2019re going to go over a little bit here. Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.Jeffrey Farmer - Wells Fargo SecuritiesGreat, thanks. Just along those lines, is there a way you can quantify your increased media support for the dollar menu in the fourth quarter and I guess into early 2013. More specifically how does that compare to what you saw through the first three quarter. So really just trying to gauge how much more intensity you put behind the dollar menu focus in the most recent quarter?Peter J. BensenJeff, basically the way that I\u2019d try to explain this to you is that we looked at the overall value expenditures, those that were spend on extra value menu and those spend on dollar menu. If you took the composite of those two and then you look at the fourth quarter \u2013 you\u2019re not going to see something that was substantially different in terms of our media expenditures, what we did was we shifted the allocation to Dollar Menu rather than the allocation being an Extra Value Menu. That's the biggest difference there.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. Actually I do want to follow up on the question on the Dollar Menu comment. Basically, you're going more towards value. Obviously, we've seen mixed results in some of your markets. I mean, I think there was a comment about how Japan \u2013 the fact that ticket was really under pressure, Australia was obviously more successful with that. Is there -- I guess could you help calibrate why that might be the case and in the US, would you expect to see as you get more innovation on value and more marketing spend, would you expect to see that pressure on average checks like you did in Japan?","Don Thompson","Sara, just to clarify, we don't expect to have a tremendous amount of innovation around bringing a lot of new products into the Dollar Menu unless they're going to be favorable from a profitability or margin perspective. So, when you saw the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger, that helped us in terms of the overall offset of margin. So, I wouldn't look to see a lot of new Dollar Menu-based products. What we want to see is a stronger balance relative to the entree-based products. So that's what's happening in the US. It is not going to be -- and as I've also heard that we are focusing more on Dollar Menu. Yes, more on Dollar Menu, but not more on the overall value perspective. The expenditures are similar, but we are focusing on a core equity that we have. Relative to Japan, that's a slightly different strategy. I'll let Tim talk a little about what we've done in Japan.","Tim Fenton","In Japan, Sara, coming off some intense promotional activities we had in celebration of the 40th anniversary of going into Japan. We're trying to get away from a lot of the couponing they were doing. It's been flooding the whole marketplace from all of the IEO industry to be more strategic and more of a branded value. So we've got a little growing pains there right now, but we think it's the best for the brand. We're seeing it resonate with our core products and again, we're still gaining in our market share. So, yeah, we have a little tough time going through this next couple of months, but we think long-term it's the way to reset our business.","Kathy Martin","Your next question is from Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if we could shift the conversation over to the human capital angle, because you've talked a lot about the marketing and menu tactics and strategies. With some of the shifts that you have had in the past year or so at the executive level, would you look at this as an inflection point and what changes do you think could be a result of those new dynamics? Thank you.","Don Thompson","Hi, Nicole. I'm going to assume, Nicole, you're talking about the shift that we had in the U.S. in leadership relative to Jeff Stratton and Jan Fields. One of the things I'd say first and foremost is, Jan was a solid leader for us at McDonald's and did an outstanding job in the U.S. business. When we looked at the results and where we wanted to take the business, we made a decision to move forward and make a leadership change. Jeff Stratton is a seasoned veteran with McDonald's. One of the things that Jeff brings is a global exposure relative to markets around the world and some of the things that they have done quite differently to enhance things like our menu pipeline. Jeff also brings a lot of operations experience as he was the head of our Restaurant Solutions Group relative to our capacity and productivity in the restaurants. And so the change that we made was a change that we saw as most appropriate for our business and we needed to be able to continue to move forward. I think his relationships with the franchisees is very solid, as Jeff at one point was one of the divisional presidents in the U.S. and so he set the ground running with collaborating with the operators, our marketing changes and enhancements that we made going into the next year and we feel very good about the prospects of where we're headed in the U.S. business.","Kathy Martin","All right. And our final question will be from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Great. Hi, thanks. I'll make this quick. On the US, the rate of unit development in 2013, where specifically are you seeing that opportunity and I guess the question is, would there be some cannibalization that could happen as you locate close to existing restaurants of is it the fact that you haven't grown in 10 years more or less, but there's a lot of trade areas where you simply haven't touched and there is opportunity for completely new sales generation? And then \u2013 and secondly, how much would moving to a developmental licensing structure in China allow unit \u2013 or will \u2013 introducing more developmental licensees, I should say, allow a China unit development to go up over the next couple of years?Don ThompsonThanks, John. Tim will talk about DL opportunities, just on the new development aspect. As we look at opportunities around the U.S. and we do have opportunities around the U.S. and we\u2019re able to cite those through some of the proprietary software that we have and also our field visits. We understand we have opportunities. But also take into account that we\u2019re not going in and establishing a target of X number of restaurants must be built. We\u2019re building to real opportunities. We\u2019re not going back to days when we wanted to just build 400, 500 restaurants regardless. That\u2019s not something that we will ever do again, John. And so when it comes to impact on existing restaurants, we really evaluate the net system sales positive effect of any new site that we\u2019ll open up. We want to make sure it is accretive to overall system cash flow, accretive to franchisee cash flow, so that\u2019s one of the things that we guard against and we look to minimize any kind of same-store impact that we might have.Relative to DL, I\u2019ll ask Tim to just speak about our DL strategy moving forward.Tim FentonYeah, John, I know we\u2019ve spoke on this several times before. We will continue to move our portfolio towards a franchising in China. It\u2019s taken us years to build up that inventory. As we\u2019ve stated before, our goal is to be anywhere between 20% and 25% franchised by 2015. We will continue to use the DL concept, its working very well for us. As far as putting a number on how many additional restaurants, it takes them a while to get used to our business as well and as we\u2019ve learned the right way on just developing a real estate, it takes some time for them to be comfortable with their area. So, I don\u2019t have a number on that, but we will continue to move not only with developmental licensee, but conventional licensing in China.Kathy MartinGreat. Thanks everyone. We\u2019re ready to close this up with Don, who has a few final comments.Don ThompsonAs we bring the call to a close this morning, I really just want to thank all of you for joining us today. I also want to acknowledge the recent passing of our Honorary Chairman and our first grill man, Fred Turner. We as McDonald\u2019s have been so fortunate that Fred Turner chose to dedicate his talents and his foresight to our great brand, and we pay the greatest tribute to Fred as we continue to deliver a consistent QSC experience to our 69 million customers each and every day.The fundamental strength of our global business remains solid. As we continue to make the right strategic decisions to mitigate short-term pressures in these challenging times. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll continue to grow our global market share which is very important while delivering enduring profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.Our McDonald\u2019s system of franchise, supplier partners and company employees are very well aligned as we execute our plan to win and long-term strategies to drive growth and we\u2019ll do that by optimizing the menu. We\u2019ll modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility around the world. So, thanks again for joining us today, and have a great day everyone.Kathy MartinThank you."],"13883":["McDonald's Corp.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Mike Flores","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Mike. Good morning.","With another solid performance in the third quarter, we remain confident in our business as we continue to execute an aggressive and holistic growth strategy. We are making substantial progress in modernizing restaurants around the world, enhancing hospitality and innovating the experience for more than 60 million customers we serve every day.","As a result, we have achieved our 13th consecutive quarter of global comparable sales growth of our increasing top-line, traffic share and guest counts in most of our top markets. During the third quarter, most of our largest international markets continue to drive momentum in our business. Canada has been on the 10-year run of success. In August, I was in Vancouver to meet with the local leadership team, and we visited the first McDonald's restaurant open in Canada.","It was recently modernized and we could see the digital menu boards, the refresh d\u00e9cor, McCafe bakery displays and other improvements making such a noticeable change to McDonald's customers. Like many of our top performing markets Canada is excelling at the fundamentals of running great restaurants.","The crew members continue to set some of the highest standards of hospitality in the McDonald's system. Customers' appreciate the commitment, crew members in Canada have to personalize service that makes each visit enjoyable as demonstrated by continued year-over-year increases in customer satisfaction scores.","Earlier this month, I was in China, we marked a full year since the successful transaction that created the largest McDonald's developmental licensee. The partnership operating at managing McDonald's businesses in Mainland China and Hong Kong offers exceptional business expertise and deep understanding of the local market. They are moving rapidly with ambitious expansion program of at least 2000 new restaurants over five years. They have opened about 375 new restaurants in 2018 over 400 in 2019 and we expect to make a ramp up the phase even more aggressively over the next few years.","I was also impressed to see how well the team in China is operating a highly competitive environment. They have made steady gains with our brand image among consumers in China's largest cities as they have modernized nearly 75% of the existing restaurants in the market.","China also is a leader in McDonald's system with two of our top growth initiatives, digital and delivery. The market has driven exceptional growth for delivery and is gaining strong adoption for its digital platform.","Many of our top international markets are well positioned to drive sustained growth for our business. We have exceptional management teams and aligned franchisees working together to execute ambitious integrated plans.","We are confident that we will continue to achieve sustained momentum as our restaurants serve delicious food, offer warm hospitality and advanced strategic platforms enabling us to satisfy rising customer expectations.","The U.S. continued to move forward with the most significant transformation ever undertaken in the largest market in the McDonald's system. As we have discussed before, the U.S. team and our franchisees are taking on a lot all at once. U.S. is maintaining an aggressive pace of modernizing restaurants, completing another 1000 projects during the quarter.","At our current pace by the end of 2019, we expect to complete over 12000 restaurants with our Experience the Future initiative making this the largest construction project in our history. They still have hard work ahead, but we are seeing an encouraging response from customers in restaurants when many of these improvements are already completed.","This is in line with our experience in other McDonald's markets such as Canada. The U.K. and Italy that executed the program several years ago that was similar to the one the U.S. is undertaking now. This continues to strengthen our confidence, Chris Kempczinski, our U.S. President, his team and our franchisees are on the right track as we introduce these enhancements to a growing number of restaurants.","As we've evolved to more heavily franchised business model we're making sure our operating structure continues to adapt. We have a growing number of developmental licensees. These business partners are intensely focused on growth and innovation and operates in some of our most complex markets.","Starting in January, we'll make changes to the operating structure of our business. Joe Erlinger, who now is President of High Growth Markets, will lead our International Operated Markets. Ian Borden, who now leads our Foundational Markets, will be President of International Developmental License Markets. This structure will ensure we provide the right level of support that will contribute to the success of our developmental licensees and other franchisees.","It will also continue to enable us to share and scale our best solutions across our international markets.","I also want to take a moment to acknowledge Doug Goare, President of our International Lead Markets and Chief Restaurant Officer. Last month, we announced his upcoming retirement. Doug has made many valuable contributions to McDonald's over his 40-year career. We've appreciated his leadership and his counsel and thank him for all he's done for our brand and our organization.","Now Kevin will discuss some of the financial performance highlights from the quarter.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve.","We're pleased with our strong sales performance for the quarter. Global comp sales increased 4.2%, reflecting positive results across all of our business segments. Comp guest counts grew in most of our top international markets, while in the U.S., guest counts declined during the quarter. As Steve mentioned, our top international markets are consistently leading in driving the performance of our system. In addition to Canada's success, here are just a few other highlights from around the world to illustrate this momentum.","Australia has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. France is enjoying eight consecutive quarters of guest count growth. The Netherlands just experienced their 14th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales and momentum continues in Japan as they now have 12 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth.","Comp sales in the International Lead Markets remained strong, up 5.4% for the quarter. The U.K. delivered their highest monthly sales and guest count volumes in their 44-year history, resulting in 50 quarters of consecutive comp sales growth. In addition, every market within the segment contributed to the growth.","As markets across the ILM segment reach critical mass on Experience of the Future, or EOTF, they continue to see higher contributions from multiple platforms, including value, delivery and digital.","In addition to Australia's launch of All Day Breakfast in 2016, they recently introduced an all-day favorites platform. Customers can now enjoy a limited menu of their favorite burgers, chicken and fries, available any time of day. The sustained positive results of the well-established markets in this segment are a demonstration of the size and scale potential of the McDonald's brand.","Turning to the U.S., comp sales increased 2.4% for the quarter. A higher average check drove sales due to favorable product mix shifts and menu price increases. The product mix shifts were a result of menu news, including glazed Buttermilk Crispy Tenders, our 100% fresh beef quarter pounders and new choices afforded to customers through our value offerings.","Initiatives deployed across the U.S., from delivery to self-order kiosks also contributed to the higher check. The U.S. plan is grounded in the importance of delivering a mix of higher average check and comparable guest count growth. As guest counts remain a challenge, we're focused on increasing customer visits.","The environment in the U.S. remains very competitive, especially around value and deal offerings. Considering this, we're pleased with our comp sales gap for the quarter of positive 70 basis points versus our QSR sandwich competitors.","On our last earnings call, I talked about the need to further appeal to our deal customer segment. We recently wrapped up a successful 2 for $5 Mix & Match Deal offer, and will soon launch a new classic meal deal option featuring some of our iconic core menu items for our customers looking for a satisfying meal at an affordable price.","Breakfast remains an opportunity. And in September, we expanded our $1 $2 $3 menu offerings by introducing $1 any size coffee as well as adopting 2 customer favorite breakfast sandwiches at the $1 price point. Soon, we'll introduce new breakfast menu items inspired by our customers. A combination of national value, a return to local breakfast deals and new food offerings positions us to win back customers at breakfast.","In the High Growth segment, comp sales grew 4.6%, with positive results across substantially all markets. Italy, the Netherlands and Poland all delivered double-digit comp sales increases for the quarter. Italy continues to gain sales and guest count momentum across all dayparts, and each of the Velocity Growth Plan accelerators are contributing meaningfully to results. And across the foundational markets, comp sales were up 6%. Each geographic region contributed positively to results with Japan continuing to lead the segment.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Kevin.","The key elements of the Velocity Growth Plan are working. We have powerful growth drivers at the heart of our strategy. The taste of our delicious food is a top reason customers choose McDonald's. The iconic sandwiches at the core of our menu continue to have strong appeal and we're always striving to make our food even better.","France, for example, where we continue to increase market share, saw success with a 50th anniversary Big Mac campaign. The market also achieved a double-digit increase in premium burger sales from the same quarter a year ago, with a lineup featuring proven successful favorites such as the 280 and the Big Tasty.","Many consumers also are more focused on the quality of ingredients in their food. And during the quarter, we announced a significant step forward we've made in the U.S. Our 7 classic burgers in the U.S. now have no artificial preservatives, no added colors from artificial sources and still no artificial flavors. This was in addition to the switch we made earlier this year to 100% fresh beef in our quarter pound burgers cooked right when you order. Previously, we also removed artificial preservatives in our Chicken McNuggets.","Now let's turn to our accelerators. Delivery, digital and Experience of the Future are proving to be catalysts for sustained growth. As we continue to maximize the impacts of these accelerators, we are expanding choices, enhancing convenience and elevating the overall experience for McDonald's customers.","We continue to move aggressively in developing the delivery opportunity. With over 37,000 restaurants, we have a massive global footprint, which provides a distinct advantage by placing us closer to more customers than any of our competitors. We're focused on expanding coverage, growing demand and innovating to increase efficiency and provide better service to our customers.","We now offer delivery from over 15,000 restaurants, representing substantial growth from the end of 2016. With the benefit of our global partnership with Uber Eats, we are continuing this expansion. We expect to reach thousands more of our restaurants by the end of the year, including a total of 9,000 in the U.S.","Delivery is becoming an increasingly meaningful contributor to comp sales. In several top markets such as the U.K, Australia and France, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales at restaurants offering delivery. We're working to encourage existing delivery customers to order more regularly as we also strive to raise awareness that McDonald's offers this convenient option. Customer satisfaction with McDelivery remains high. Once they experience the convenience, many of them become our most loyal customers, frequently reordering the delivery. The delivery market is evolving rapidly and we're committed to innovating so we remain competitive.","We are seeing improved speed and accuracy after completing an initiative early this year to integrate delivery orders into our point-of-sale systems in many of our restaurants. We are exploring additional innovation opportunities ranging from integrating delivery ordering through our mobile app to new packaging that will protect the quality of our food to new approaches that improve efficiency at our restaurants with the highest delivery volumes. Underpinning everything we do with this growth accelerator is our commitment to make delivery easy and convenient for our customers, which will help us maximize the competitive advantage for our business.","We have also introduced new technology to our customers that allows them to engage on their terms. Self-order kiosks, which are already in over 15,000 of our restaurants worldwide, provide customers an opportunity to spend more time browsing the menu and personalizing their orders. Supported by our guest experience leaders and with the option of table service, the popularity and utilization of self-order kiosks continue to grow over time with a higher average ticket.","In France, Italy and Spain, well over half of all in-restaurant visits are transacted through the kiosk.","We continue to engage customers through our global mobile app. Many of our markets have used special deal offers to drive incremental traffic and encourage increased utilization of the app.","During the quarter, the U.S. doubled the pace of downloads and registered users, driving more transactions through the app. As this base of active users grows and the rate of mobile order and pay adoption increases, we are providing our guests greater convenience on their terms while gaining deeper insights on their purchasing behavior. All of this is helping us create a foundational base of information upon which we will build programs to deepen our customer relationships.","Through EOTF, we are elevating convenience, hospitality and personalization for McDonald's customers. The improvements include crew members who serve in the front of our restaurants as guest experience leaders, kiosk ordering, table service, digital menu boards and a global mobile app. It's clear that customers notice and appreciate the changes we are making. When all of these elements are in place at a restaurant, we are seeing improvements in sales and guest counts.","We've seen steady improvements in overall customer satisfaction and in particular in the U.S. restaurants, which have put in place all of the growth strategy initiatives. These restaurants were achieving significant growth in both new customers and frequency of visits by existing customers. And these customers are giving us much higher satisfaction ratings, especially for those that dine in.","We're encouraged by the opportunity for our business as we continue to roll out EOTF to more restaurants around the world, maximize the customer and business impacts and to find ways to further elevate the customer experience in the future. We have made significant progress in deploying EOTF across the McDonald's System over the past year. And by the end of the year, we expect to have converted over 15,000 restaurants across the global system, including half of all restaurants in the U.S.","Kevin Ozan","As Steve mentioned, the U.S. is modernizing at an unprecedented pace, transforming over 3,000 restaurants to-date in 2018 alone and expecting to surpass our original target of about 4,000 projects this year. As we move at a quickened pace, we continue to learn throughout this process and adapt our approach in order to maximize the benefits to the business.","Overall, restaurants have experienced a little longer downtime than we expected, so we're focused on limiting that in order to minimize the impact on sales and guest counts.","The downtime in our restaurants ranges from partial, for example, when the drive-through remains open, but the lobby is closed for remodel, to full, when a restaurant has a large scope project and the restaurant completely closes for a short period of time. The sales and guest count recovery period after we complete a project has also been a little inconsistent. So we've put processes in place to execute strong grand reopening plans after construction that involve our local communities. Overall, we are seeing the sales lifts we expected, so our efforts are focused on achieving those results as quickly as possible.","Our refranchising strategy has been a key part of transforming McDonald's into a more purposeful, stable and efficient organization focused on delivering long-term growth. We're now more than a year out from our significant refranchising efforts, including the China, Hong Kong transaction last year and I'm pleased with our resulting global financial performance.","Earnings per share for the quarter was $2.10, a 22% increase in constant currencies after excluding prior year special items. Year-to-date, our operating margin improved to 43%. Nearly 85% of our total restaurant margin dollars for the quarter came from our franchise business and the growth in franchise margin dollars more than offset the decrease in company-owned restaurant margin dollars.","Franchise margins for the quarter benefited from refranchising as well as positive comp sales growth, partially offset by higher depreciation related to our EOTF partnering contributions in the U.S.","Consolidated company operated margins declined 70 basis points to 18.4% for the quarter. ILM company operated margins grew 60 basis points driven by positive comp sales, partially offset by commodities and continuing labor pressures.","U.S. company operated margins were challenged due to EOTF, labor costs and commodity pressures. Our company-owned restaurants in the U.S. are modernizing at an accelerated pace. In addition to the anticipated depreciation pressure on margins, our restaurants converting to EOTF are experiencing a temporary decline in labor productivity due to a combination of lower guest counts and continuing to pay crew during construction downtime. We expect this pressure to dissipate in mid-2019.","Moving on to menu pricing and commodities. In the U.S., third quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 2% while commodity costs for the quarter increased nearly 3%. We expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat in Q4 and anticipate our U.S. grocery basket will be up about 2% for the full year.","For the International Lead Markets, menu prices averaged about 1.5% higher year-over-year. Commodity costs were also up about 1.5% for the quarter and we still expect commodities to be up about 2% for the full year.","Continuing on to G&A. At the beginning of the year, we indicated that we expected our G&A for the year to be down about 1% in constant currencies with fluctuations between quarters due to the timing of spending. For the third quarter, in constant currencies, our G&A was down 8%, which resulted in cost being down 3% through the first 9 months of the year. We now expect G&A cost to be down about 1% to 2% for the full year.","Our effective tax rate was 24% for the quarter. We now expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, down from 25% to 27%, although we may have additional favorable adjustments in Q4 as we finalize the amounts recorded at the end of last year related to U.S. tax reform.","Turning to foreign currencies. For the quarter, foreign currency translation hurt our results by $0.05 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the impact of foreign currency to be a similar headwind in the fourth quarter, which would result in a full year benefit of $0.03 to $0.05. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year.","Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to touch on our capital allocation. Our first priority remains investing in the business to drive future growth through initiatives such as EOTF. Our current expectation is that we'll spend about $2.5 billion in capital this year.","As we communicated last month, we increased our quarterly dividend by 15% to $1.16 per share, the equivalent of $4.64 annually. The dividend meaningfully contributes to our cash return target, which we increased to about $25 billion for the 3-year period ending 2019 and reinforces our confidence in our long-term strategy.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Kevin.","We provided an overview of the progress we are making and perspectives about why we remain so encouraged by velocity strategy and the future of our business. Most of our largest international markets continue to drive momentum. U.S. is growing sales as it makes investments that will enhance the experience of customers we serve. We're encouraged by the success of restaurants that have already put the growth initiatives in place.","We will continue to fine-tune our tactics, but we are confident that our strategy is clearly guiding our business in the right direction. The McDonald's System is focused on execution and committed to unlocking even greater potential.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mike Flores","Thanks Steve. We are now going to open the call for analysts and investor questions. Please press start one, if you have a question and pound one to remove yourself from the queue. And to give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions please limit yourself to one question and we will come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. Now, our first is from David Palmer with RBC. David?","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning.","Question, I think, for Steve on the U.S. There's been a lot of change obviously in 2018. And I think people are trying to figure out which parts of this are temporary friction that you'll evolve out of into 2019 and beyond? And then, maybe where you have learned something and you're going to make adjustments. Just, I guess, to summarize, you've had that shift in marketing dollars out of regional to national value. You have the Experience of the Future. And then, of course, people are hearing about these headlines about franchisees that are adjusting to a new structure of communication and decision-making and I think people want to understand what adjustments you might have to make for that, too. Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, David, thanks.","As we've said all along, really, throughout this year and it will continue through '19. We're taking on a really ambitious plan in the U.S. And we're at that kind of -- the grind out stage at the moment where we're putting significant investments into the restaurant and adapting to changes in that. And it's -- naturally, that's just how it works. So the good news is that we've always had a very proactive, positive relationship with our owner-operators as much as we have with our suppliers. We call it the 3-legged stool. So any conversations which are constructive and helpful into how we can better execute our plan, we're totally open to. So Kevin referred to 1 or 2 things we're looking at with regards to EOTF, for example, on how do we minimize the impact of the downtime so we can come out stronger.","So whether it's the initiatives -- and we're learning as we go along with regards to the most effective way of investing the national marketing spend versus the local, for the co-ops. And we continue to learn as we go along there. And breakfast is a good example where we feel there's more regionalization to breakfast, and therefore, we're going to swing a little bit more of our emphasis on the marketing side to the local co-ops to take ownership of that. And then, we can invest in more national platforms in the center.","So I think this is evolving. What is really encouraging for us and just keep reminding ourselves why we're doing what we're doing, is not only does the international business provide a helpful kind of signpost to what the opportunities are. But actually even here in the U.S. now, if we look at the analysis between the performance of restaurants which haven't yet adopted any of the EOTF and the major initiatives all the way to those restaurants that have adopted multiple of the initiatives within their bigger, bolder vision plan, there is actually an absolute crystal clear correlation at both sales and guest count level and customer satisfaction level that, literally, as you step up the initiatives -- whether it's going to be EOTF, whether it's table service, whether it's delivery, whether it's outdoor menu boards, for example. As you step up the number of initiatives the restaurants adopt, sales step up nicely with it as do guest counts and customer satisfaction.","So you can expect us clearly, as we always do, to work with the operators. And any constructive ideas we're absolutely wide open to. We're just -- our success is inextricably linked. And we actually see our franchisee relationships as being something which is something of a competitive advantage for us. It has been over time and we see it continuing that way. So I think, fundamentally, the key elements that we have built into the bigger, bolder vision plan, which is really pulled together between our own leadership and the operator leadership through the course of 2017, we're still confident in. And as I say, the international business provides a good signpost for that.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Great thanks. I wanted to dig into the gap to domestic quick service peers that narrowed in 3Q. You guys are obviously introducing impactful initiatives to grow mix through fresh beef, then the new chicken tenders flavors while remaining competitive on value, through enhancements to the $1, $2, $3 menu as well as the new 2 for $5 promotion. Has the offset to your efforts been a more broad slowdown in service times across U.S. system? Or is this being confined to the disruption of traffic from remodel construction. And if it is the latter, can you help quantify what the impact has been to 3Q comps?","Kevin Ozan","I can start and then Steve can chime in.","Let me talk briefly about the comp gap that you started talking about, the 70 basis points for this quarter. I guess, we certainly look at, I'll say, all of the above current year comps, 2- and 3-year stacks, just to look at kind of trends in our business. I think we feel pretty good about the fact that we've had 7 consecutive quarters, 11 out of the last 12 of positive comp sales gap versus those QSR sandwich competitors. I would say that service times still are an opportunity. And I guess, I'll let Steve talk a little bit about that. But it is fair to say that service times remain an opportunity. And so that is one of the big opportunities that I think we still have to continue closing or kind of accelerating that gap.","EOTF drag, I guess, real quickly, we won't quantify every quarter what the EOTF drag is. But just to give a perspective, roughly, if I look at year-to-date comps in the U.S., roughly it's probably around 0.5 point impact negative certainly on our U.S. comps. And there are several components of that, as you know. One would be the downtime we're experiencing. And so we're focused on reducing that downtime. One would be the recovery time and how long it takes for us to get back to and kind of volumes that we were at, plus the lift that we expect. And then, net of that is obviously the sales lifts we're getting. As time goes on, obviously, our expectation is that the negative drags will start dissipating as we complete projects while we will obviously be left with the sales increases and sales lift.","So again, that's what we've seen in our international markets. I'd say it is a little bit longer downtime, a little bit longer recovery period. But we are seeing similar overall trends in the U.S. that we have seen internationally.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to add to what Kevin was saying there. I mean, interestingly enough for us, as Kevin said, our service times have slowed down. But interestingly, customer satisfaction has improved. So now we don't just want to rely on that. But it's interesting that as we have enhanced the broader experience that we do see customer satisfaction levels improve, but we also know that speed is a fundamental part of our DNA.","So when you look back over the last 2 to 3 years with the introduction of initiatives such as All Day Breakfast, which should help drive the top-line, but have added a level of complexity into the restaurants, introduction of fresh beef, which has really enhanced the taste and the quality of the quarter pounder in the signature ranges, but has been an operational challenge to absorb.","And even if you look at such initiatives such as GMA offer redemptions and just the speed with which our drive-through teams can redeem offers and still keep the car count moving through. I think we've got ourselves a challenge into 2019 that I know the team are focused on, which is around how do we get back to the concept of net simplification. I mean, we are always going to want to introduce initiatives that are attractive to customers, which are reflecting where customers want us to go and the changing taste, but at the same time, how can we maintain that discipline of making sure we take as much out as we ever put into the restaurants.","So I know in particular with the drive-through, that is a focus between our leadership and operator leadership, and a team has been established to make a meaningful headway into that. It's slightly less of an issue for us in-store, obviously, because customers are now self-selecting how they order. Many are choosing to go to the self-order kiosk because they can get longer dwell time there. They don't feel so hurried. If you're slightly more in that kind of grab-and-go mode, let's say, a busy lunchtime, weekday lunchtime, then you go to the front counter as you typically have. So you'll see greater focus on the drive-through and we do have an ambition to bring the service times back down.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.","Eric Gonzalez","Okay. Thanks for the question. Can you comment on the performance of breakfast in the U.S. during the quarter? Are you still losing share in the morning daypart and maybe if the loss accelerate in the quarter? How much was breakfast hurt by the messaging of the advertising shift?","Steve Easterbrook","Well, as you say, we've made some tweaks through the year actually at breakfast, both in terms of regional spend -- shifting some of that spend to regional. We're still losing a little share. It's very competitive out there at breakfast. We did make some changes in September, such as adding $1 any size coffee, $1 sausage biscuit, $1 sausage muffin. Again, the local co-ops choosing which of those items are best suited for their customer base. So that shift was really largely through September. So it's a little early to tell as to whether that's going to be sufficient.","But we're also -- we haven't had much new food news at breakfast for a little while. And you'll see some new food news in the fourth quarter this year, which I know the team are excited about and so am I. So it continues to be a battleground. I mean, just go back to Andrew's previous question and this one, Eric, is the reality is, it's a market share fight on traffic. There's really no tailwinds in traffic. Any expansion or any additions that anyone, from our data, is seeing is really through new units additions. So on a like-for-like basis, whilst we can get sales growing, I don't see many people -- many out there in the sector who are actually growing traffic at all. So you really -- it's a scrap and it's a market share fight and our teams are responding.","So we want to do better at breakfast. We've got some initiatives in place, which we're going to see out through the next few months and also some new food news, which we think will reenergize the daypart.","Mike Flores","And our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Question regarding the U.S. and just the store level margins there. Can you tell us what the decline was year-over-year in the margin there, when you strip out the EOTF down time pressures meaning what was just the decline in margin trend from the kind of the real pressures you're seeing.","And a follow up on that, how are these margin issues that are you are seeing framing the current conversations that you're having with franchisees related to the overall strategy, whether that be menu strategy or EOTF strategy and what not? Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","I will talk about kind of the financial piece of the U.S. market, then I'll let Steve talk about the owner-operators related to that.","A couple of things here, I'll say there were a few pressures on margins this quarter. One was, I'll say, overall labor pressures and that has 2 main components to it. One of them is kind of increase in wages and labor costs. And second is productivity, which would be the downtime and lost guest counts related to EOTF. I'd say about roughly half of the labor impact was due to each of those. So roughly half was on productivity, roughly half on wages.","The other piece of hitting margins is the depreciation related to our investments. So as you know, we're -- if I think about the company-operated stores, obviously, we're incurring capital to remodel those stores and the depreciation related to that is also hitting margins.","This quarter, we also had some commodity pressure, a little bit more than we had the previous 2 quarters and a little bit more than we expect to have next quarter. So the combination of the labor cost, productivity, depreciation and commodities all hit company-operated margins and put pressure on them this quarter.","The only thing, I guess, I'd remind everyone of is our McOpCo margin dollars these days represent less than 10% of our total margin dollars in the U.S. because of the refranchising that we've done and the fact that we're now 95% franchised. But obviously, it does impact restaurant-level profitability and certain of those costs certainly have an impact on operators also.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Just to take up the owner-operator sentiment. I mean, clearly, stating the obvious, owner-operators want to grow cash flow and we want owner-operators to grow cash flow. Our plan was built and designed to do exactly that. Clearly, they're seeing many of the same input cost pressures that the company-owned restaurants are. And when you've got your 2 major lines, food and labor both with inflationary increases that puts pressure on the bottom-line. So I mean, really, this comes down to it being a growth story. We're having strong average check growth, as you would have recognized. And partly, that's because of the strategic investments we're making. I mean, we're seeing higher average checks at the self-order kiosk because people dwell for longer. We're seeing clearly a higher average check in our delivery orders. That can be somewhere between 1.5 and 2x a normal average check.","And then some of the other menu initiatives, such as the glazed chicken tenders, for example, have helped boost average check. So it's not an average check story. This is about getting the guest count moving. And if we can get both of those alongside each other, that will give us the top line growth that we're looking for.","And I think wherein, back in the day, it used to be sort of a 2% to 3% comp would have helped just a flat at a margin percentage level. We need stronger growth than that. So -- and that's the mindset with which we've built our plans. All of our markets in the developed world are facing similar input cost pressures. So -- and that's why the strength of the international growth is so positive because it does translate into cash flow growth as well as top line growth.","But that's why we're going to stay not single minded, but certainly focused on getting the guest count momentum back into the U.S. business. If we can maintain -- if we can generate that and maintain the average check growth, then that's going to be a lot more profitable for our owner-operators, which is what we're keen to see.","Mike Flores","And our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. My question is with respect to the G&A savings and the improved guidance there. How sustainable are those lower rates of savings than what you had originally targeted for?","Kevin Ozan","So, again at the beginning of the year we said that we'd be down -- we expect to be down about 1%, we are now saying 1% to 2%. So in our mind it's not dramatically different this year than what we expected. We will have a little bit more decline next year and certainly we won't have costs related to our operator convention that we have every other year. We don't have costs related to Olympics and then we've taken some actions this year where we will get a full year of savings next year such as the U.S. reorganization.","So I think we're well set up to achieve on our G&A savings that we expected next year and this year is coming in a little bit maybe more than we expected or relatively in line. ","Mike Flores","And our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Thank you. Two, I think basically follow ups. First, it surprised me a little bit that the net EOTF impact in the U.S. was 50 basis points year-to-date '18. So I was hoping you pour some thoughts in terms of what you thought that impact would be as we got into the fourth quarter of '18 and first half of '19 is the first clarification.","And then, secondly, half of the U.S. system will be on EOTF by the end of '18. One could interpret that '19 CapEx would be even higher than '18 CapEx or revised '18 CapEx. But I did want to make sure whether that was true or maybe some of the increase that we saw in this '18 CapEx is in fact paying forward for some of the project that you'll be doing in '19 thus allowing your previous CapEx guidance to '19 to remain unchanged?","Kevin Ozan","Thanks John. I'll take both of those. Regarding the net EOTF drag if you will, I said on a year-to-date basis, it's above roughly half a point, it is fair to say that the impact in Q2 and Q3 were more than Q1. So I guess, I'll say it's safe to assume that may have been a little more than 0.5 this quarter, but -- if we want to look at this on a longer term basis because to us there is a long-term initiative for the long-term sustainability of our U.S. business. So I don't want to get into having to talk about a specific impact every quarter which is why we've talked about it on year-to-date. But it is fair to assume that it was a little bit heavier impact on an individual quarter comp sales.","Regarding capital, so we said that our capital this year we expect around $2.5 billion. If we look at couple of things I guess to know regarding this year's EOTF projects. One, a little bit heavier skewed to McOpCo, our company-operated stores. So we've completed about 60% of the projects, the company-operated restaurants. So a little bit more skewed to company operated restaurants.","The other thing that I would say is, while downtime is a little bit heavier and recovery period is a little bit longer. Construction costs are probably a little bit higher than we originally anticipated to partly because we're going in a -- quicken the pace. And so we're not going to achieve some of the efficiencies that we may have thought that we were going to not dramatically different. So what that means for capital in 2019 is, our CapEx should be relatively similar maybe a little bit higher in 2019 and 2018. We will likely do a relatively similar number of projects potentially a little bit less, but there are some of the higher cost projects.","So if you think about what we've got accomplished in 2018, we got a -- we will get more than our 4000 projects done, but some of them are a little bit skewed to the lower costs on easier project to get done. In 2019, it will be some of the higher cost more intense projects if you will. So our overall capital should be relatively similar to the 2.5 again maybe a little bit higher than 2.5 but not substantially higher.","And then, again, we have seen some inflation I would say in the construction costs that has impacted some other cost. We do expect this overall impact of EOTF to start looking positive as we progress through 2009, probably in the back half of 2019 is when you should expect to see the net impact EOTF being net positive .","Mike Flores","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning, Steve. I want to come back to your discussion on throughput for the U.S. business. Seems like a big opportunity we've been talking about now for multiple years and I know you've thrown a lot at the system in the past year or so in terms of complexity and new operating approaches. So I'm just wondering, I guess if you can elaborate a little bit more on what you think the opportunity is and what type of -- in terms of drive through speed in terms of time. You think you can shave off of that and what it might mean for the sales going forward?","And how quickly you think you can start turning the dial on that whether it's a 2019 or even longer term impact? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Sure, David. I think -- I mean, I think the greatest opportunity we have as we look all around the world and the U.S. is no different, is continuing to maintain our kind of system standards of day-to-day operations. You'll hear me talk a lot about running better restaurants and that's not loose rhetoric. That's an underlying principle by which we're all embracing and at the same time, consumers get increasingly demanding. And therefore, they expect different forms of service. They expect greater interaction with technology. They expect more menu innovation, et cetera, et cetera. So it's always a delicate balance to get the operational foundation right whilst also creating enough energy and attraction in our business to win customers more often in a flat market, frankly.","So don't want to put a quantification on the improvement of drive-through. But what we can do and we have done, and you may even remember it from when we actually launched the velocity plan back in March of last year. We're able to model really what we believe the car throughput would be as you can positively impact service times. So whether it's from a car that may be turning away as they enter the lot because they could see the line and that will just turn them off and they'll carry on going, all the way through to just literally throughput through -- in particularly in the peak hours, obviously, the lunchtime hours and the early evening hours. But it's a fundamental truth that the quicker we're able to get service, the more cars we can serve and -- because we are beginning to create the demand.","We just need to just be able to meet that now as well. So we'll have more to say around it. But there are probably seven or eight sub-teams within the U.S. working at a number of different areas around complexity. Menu is one of them. Getting reliable technology, working on a more consistent basis would be another on how we can ease the merchandising. We clearly have a broad menu, but how much of that do you merchandise? Do you tend to focus more on your highest-selling items, for example. How we can also improve the training and reduce -- and improve retention of our crew in the restaurants would be another one. What other elements of the building and equipment could we continue to invest in, which would actually make it just easier for our managing crew to run great restaurants. So -- and then just getting back into the disciplines of day-to-day operations, making sure that as we release new initiatives to the restaurant, we provide fantastic training materials for our teams and make sure we don't overload them.","So it's kind of a multi-pronged approach. We will continue to be introducing things to our restaurants because that's what our customers expect. But I do think we need to do -- collectively, we need to do a better job and I need to do a better job at ensuring that there's a corresponding reduction in just the workflow for our managing crews. They're working hard out there, and it's not easy. And we're committed to making a difference.","Mike Flores","Next up is Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Perhaps looking outside the U.S. for a moment, Steve you mentioned China and what sounded like encouraging commentary all around in terms of new leaders and their initiatives and how they're pretty keen to accelerate unit growth and what will be your largest market outside of the U.S.?","I'm just wondering if you can provide any more color around that in terms of performance maybe the comps this quarter or just broader sentiment because whether it's in comps or consumer behavior or all the headlines we hear about is this caution. And I would have thought we might have heard more of a tempering tale around the China growth story. So maybe you can provide any insight into anything you're hearing whether the qualitative or quantitative that might indicate that?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. Absolutely, it was -- as I mentioned in my comments, I was out there earlier this month actually, I managed to spend two or three days in Beijing with our partners, with our management teams out there and obviously getting into a restaurant. So to give you a sense on the quarter, sales were marginally up in China for quarter three, guest counts were up stronger than that. So they -- the number of initiatives to drive customers into restaurants and that just gives us a marginal positive sales comp.","I felt really good about the fundamentals of the market. I mean the 3000-ish restaurants now, 75% of those have being remodeled to the full EOTF standards. They are system leading for us in terms of delivery, both the combination of the McDonald's delivery service, MDS as we call it, which was the original system we adopted there. And then, the use of number of third party operators. Now, it is a dramatic to experience. And I was in one restaurant in Beijing where they created a -- more dedicated delivery area in the front of the restaurant where they were able to just take the riders, and the drivers would come in and we could just service them independently, so it didn't distract from in-store dining experience for our customers.","I mean they continue the remarkable journey on the digital platform for example. So we've seen -- got about 60 million app downloads for example, therefore building this rich database of customer behaviors and understanding on the same purchase patents. But also encouraging, just the interaction with our partners, they've got a good long-term perspective. They have already previously announced the ramp up in new restaurant openings from 375 this year, reached, it will be just over 400 in '19. And it won't surprise me to see that kind of rate of acceleration will continue as you look into the out years. Under the new ownership and our management team have settled into a good constructive working relationship.","And so I think overall we feel really strong. We were in a very strong position in Tier 1 cities in the most developed cities, it's a bit tougher in the lower tier cities. And again, we are going to keep working on the best positioning for us, the investment levels in the restaurant, menu prices and restaurant sales expectations as we opened more restaurants in those lower tier cities, so we still have a lot more to learn there. But, we have got the right partners in place, you got a deep understanding of the Chinese consumer and Chinese marketplace. So overall, I left China feeling really encouraged that a year 15 months into the new ownership structure that we've made a great decision. And also I'm going to say the -- what was also encouraging is that we're not really seeing any meaningful anti-American sentiment given some of the geopolitical issues that clearly exist between the countries. So I think increasingly, we're being seen to be a local business -- a locally owned business of a global brand and that's also encouraging as well.","Mike Flores","So we have time for one final question. And that would be Andy Barish with Jefferies.","Andy Barish","Yes. I was just wondering as you go through your kind of operating plan and look out towards '19, your competence in reaching kind of your normalized target that you've outlined before any puts and takes that we should be aware of it at this stage after what was termed kind of a choppy 2018?","Kevin Ozan","Yes. I can talk about the financial targets obviously. I think we talked about that we're progressing on operating margins. So I felt very good about our sales target, our operating margins, our ROIIC target and our EPS target as well as achieving our G&A target that we've set. So as I think about all the things that we've set out there going into 2019, I think we feel pretty good about all of those. Obviously, the U.S. continues to be a very competitive market, but as we look overall, I feel really good about all those. And I feel certainly good about achieving our cash return to shareholders target by the end of 2019.","So I think we entered 2019 with pretty good confidence in the business knowing that as Steve said we still got a big street fight to continue in the U.S. just for us to continue getting all of our projects done while in the same time trying to achieve comp scale to increase and turn around the outcome growth there.","Steve Easterbrook","And then, just to add to that, I mean, momentum is a very important psychological helps guide behaviors of our teams. I think as we -- as winning is contagious from market-to-market. I think with our new simplified structure previously, and then, the way we are going to adopt it into the new year. Just the visibility of what working for market-to-market is only getting better and the speed with which we are lifting, localizing and then launching these initiatives has never been greater.","We've been through -- clearly we go through our annual planning processes, as we exit or look to exit 2018. I think 16 of our top 18 markets are in positive sales comp territory and some of them are quite -- have incredibly strong sales momentum as well. Certainly as we go through the early look-up plans for next year, I would say our Managing Directors in the markets are confident that momentum continuing. Clearly we are planning to grow in each and every market around the world. So I think the next year -- the next four to six weeks we shape up the detail of the 2019 plans. If there is a mood of optimism amongst the Managing Directors and our field leaders and I share that. But, obviously, none of this is taken for granted. There is not a single market out there, where there is easy growth that just simply is not. Even though what have typically been the hyperinflationary countries where you have a lovely tailwind the likes of a China or Russia historically though. So these are now much more mature markets, much more competitive and we've to sharpen our games in those markets as well. But we are confident in the direction we're heading and excited about what's more to come.","Mike Flores","Thank you, Steve and Kevin, and thank you, everyone for participating.

Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. In addition, McDonald's Chief Administrative Officer, Pete Bensen will join us for Q&A. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast and podcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.","Stephen Easterbrook","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Since stepping into this role maybe two months ago, I've been relentlessly focused on assessing current plans, challenging our people and teams to think differently about what we're doing and how we're doing it, and working with senior leadership to determine the best path forward.","As we announced this morning, we have scheduled a separate call on May 4 to share the initial details of our turnaround plan. We appreciate your patience, as we focus today on our first quarter results and the overall approach we are taking as we develop plans to reenergize the business.","First quarter performance reinforces our imperative to stabilize and improve our underlying business performance. Let me start by sharing an overview of recent performance across the top nine markets that contribute most of our overall consolidated results, starting with Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which are trending positive.","Australia is in the early stages of turning around its business through a multifaceted approach to enhance brand appeal for consumers. This includes meaningful enhancements to our menu, including both core and new menu items across several categories, value platforms and better restaurant operations.","The U.K. continues its strong track record of positive performance with first quarter comparable sales representing the market's 36 consecutive quarter of growth. These results reflect the market's diligent execution of its customer-centric plans that span multiple initiatives, including food choice and food quality, marketing and promotions and enhancements to the service experience, such as expanding drive-through capacity during peak periods and building the overnight experience.","In addition, in Canada, strong promotional performance and new menu news drove average check and positive comparable sales performance for the quarter. Next, are Germany and China, two markets that have shown recent signs of improvement.","In Germany, negative comparable sales trends have moderated in the last two quarters. The market has strengthened its value platform, and at the same time promoted premium products and add-on purchases to their average check. We expect recovery in this market to remain uneven, however, as reflected in March's weak comparable sales performance.","China continues to recover from last year's supplier issue. Efforts to regain brand trust are working, and the market remains on track to return to a normalized level of performance by mid-year.","And finally, the U.S., France, Russia and Japan, where challenges persist. U.S. results remain disappointing. Recent actions taken by Mike and his leadership team, including implementing a more efficient operating structure, simplifying the menu and holding the U.S. Turnaround Summit with operators in March, are helping to create a renewed sense of energy and focus around better delivery of local customer needs.","In both, France and Russia, consumer confidence remains low and challenging macroeconomic conditions continue to negatively impact results. Despite a declining IEO industry, France continues to maintain market share with efforts to strengthen the value platform and enhance the customer service experience on differentiating the brand in the market.","Amidst the external pressures in Russia, the team remains focused on driving sales through strong product and promotional offers, growing the breakfast business and initiatives that focus on rebuilding brand trust with consumers in the market. Japan's recovery from the supply issue has not been as strong as China, and subsequent consumer perception issues have further depressed sales and profitability.","As evidenced by last week's announcement of the business revitalization plan, the Japanese and APMEA teams are intensely focused on addressing the significant challenges in this market, though we expect results will continue to be negatively impacted for the foreseeable future. And Kevin will provide more details around our first quarter results in a moment.","Let me shift gears now and discuss the approach I am taking to lead McDonald's into the future. My operating principles, if you will. First is a greater emphasis on personal accountability. I am honest and fair if I don't dispense forced kindness. Where we need to fix the fundamentals, we need to act now; and where we need to make an impact, I'm not looking for incremental steps.","We intend to make meaningful impact with customers and how they perceive our brand and our food. I hold people accountable for tangible actions and outputs, and I can assure you that I hold myself accountable to these same high standards.","My second operating principle is grounded in the customer. As a retail business we must be even more customer-centric. This means deeper understanding, better listening, better segmentation, genuine sharp insights regarding what our customers want and need and when they want it, as determined from the smart use of data and analytics. We need to be the best at knowing what matters most to consumers, and we will focus our best talent and prioritize spending, where it will optimally support our turnaround.","My third philosophy is progress over perfection. We will try new things, move fast with what works and even faster from what doesn't. And when we find winning plays, we'll be more nimble, much like we did with the rollout of Apple Pay this last fall, from first contact to going live to 12 weeks. We can make meaningful changes for customers in weeks. We just have to do it more often.","My final approach to leading is I champion simplicity. We are simplifying for greater transparency, accountability and speed. We are making the business more responsive to market conditions, while using our scale advantage more effectively. We cannot afford to carry legacy attitudes and legacy thinking, and we won't.","My overall vision is for McDonald's to be seen as a modern, progressive burger company, delivering a contemporary customer experience. Modern is about getting the brand to where we need to be today, and progressive is about doing what it takes to be the McDonald's, our customers will expect tomorrow.","We are already moving more assertively in this direction, with actions that delight our customers and energize our brand. For example, we recently committed to enhance the benefits to employees at company-owned restaurants in the U.S., including a wage increase and paid time off for full and part-time for employees.","In March, we announced in the U.S. that we will stop using antibiotics that are important to human medicines, and are checking supply chain within the next two years. And there are plans to feature 100% sirloin burgers for a limited time in the U.S., along with a current test on all-day breakfast.","We also undertook a significant effort to excite our customers and bring the world together virtually with I'm Lovin It 24. About 70,000 people participated in the event, which included 24 hours of McDonald's inspired disruptive creativity in major cities around the world. And it garnered more than 2 billion impressions across public relations stories and social media interactions.","Last month, the German team opened a new 500-seat flagship restaurant in Frankfurt, showcasing our most modern digital and service amenities. And just yesterday, we announced our global commitment on deforestation, which confirms our aspiration to end deforestation throughout our supply chain.","We are harvesting the power inherent in the McDonald's brand and in our network of valued franchisees, employees and supplier partners to make this great brand even greater. One of the advantages of my broad experience within McDonald's and running other restaurant chains is seeing other cultures, different structures, different models.","Through this experience, I see McDonald's and its fundamental advantages, challenges and opportunities much more clearly. It is this perspective that is helping me look objectively in the business and make decision to position McDonald's to deliver enduring, profitable growth for shareholders and the system.","Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve, and hello, everyone. We begin 2015 taking action, to lay the foundation for McDonald's turnaround, as we work to address the significant internal and external headwinds that are impacting our business.","Today I'd like to begin by discussing the performance factors that impacted our first quarter results, including the strategic charges taken in the quarter. Then I'll provide updates on key financial metrics and close with some final thoughts about our path to realizing our long-term potential.","Our financial model, and therefore my remarks, start with topline sales. First quarter comparable sales were down 2.3%, reflecting negative guest traffic across all of our geographic segments. APMEA's first quarter comp sales decline of 8.3% had the largest impact on our global performance, with Japan and China posting declines of 32.3% and 4.8%, respectively.","While these results are partly due to the lingering impact of the APMEA supplier issue, Japan's performance reflects the broad-based consumer perception challenges that the market is working to overcome. Japan accounts for the lion's share of this segment's quarterly comparable sales decline. Sales trends in China continue to show sequential improvement, as we moved through the quarter. And Australia remains a bright spot, posting its third consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales.","In the U.S., comparable sales were down 2.6% for the quarter, as the segment's slightly positive breakfast dayparts was offset by weakness across all other dayparts. We are working to enhance the customer experience with locally relevant taste, a simplified menu and compelling value offerings. Europe comparable sales ended the quarter down 0.6%, with positive performance in the UK more than offset by weak results in France and Russia.","Looking ahead to April, global comparable sales are expected to be negative. This weak topline performance accounted for about half of the constant currency decline in operating income for the first quarter. The other half of the decline in operating income is attributable to the $195 million of strategic charges taken in the quarter to optimize the business.","The first component of the charges, totaling $85 million, includes asset write-offs related to our refranchising initiative, as we made decisions to sell certain restaurants to developmental licensees. The next component of these charges is related to the strategic decisions to close about 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, the U.S. and China. These restaurant closings are in addition to the 350 global restaurant closings originally planned for 2015.","The total charge for asset write-offs related to these incremental closings was approximately $72 million. Most of these restaurants were not contributing to our overall profitability or cash flow, and we will continue to review our restaurant portfolio with the intent of optimizing our asset base around the world. The final component of the charges was $38 million related to restructuring costs for our U.S. business. This amount consist primarily of employee severance and other related costs.","Earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.37, which include $0.17 related to the strategic charges and $0.09 in negative foreign currency impact. Excluding the impact of the charges and foreign currency translation, earnings per share for the quarter was down $0.11 or 9%. From an operating perspective, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which declined $152 million to $1.6 billion, a 1% decrease in constant currencies.","Global company-operated margin dollars declined $164 million to $560 million for the quarter, a 13% decrease in constant currencies. The company-operated margin percent decreased 180 basis points to 14.3%, reflecting negative comparable guest counts across all segments as well as higher commodity and labor costs.","Next, I want to provide an update on our commodities, pricing, foreign currency impact and cash returned to shareholders. I'll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe.","For the first quarter, U.S. commodity cost rose approximately 2%, primarily due to higher beef prices. To help offset this pressure, we took some price increases. Our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 2%, which was below food-away-from-home inflation of around 3%. The current projected increase in food-away-from-home inflation for the full year is 2% to 3%.","Excluding currency, Europe's commodity cost were relatively flat in the first quarter. Our pricing increases in Europe, varied by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year.","Now, turning to foreign currency impact. The U.S. dollar has strengthened dramatically against nearly all of the world's other major currencies. During the last eight months, the dollar has experienced its fastest rise in 40 years. At these levels, foreign currency translation is having a significant impact on our reported results, as evidenced by the $700 million impact to our first quarter reported revenues and the $0.09 impact to our first quarter reported EPS.","Based on current exchange rates, we now expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact our results by $0.13 to $0.14 in the second quarter and $0.40 to $0.45 for the full year. As usual, take this as directional guidance only, because rates will change, as we move throughout the year. And keep in mind, this is an accounting translation impact more than a cash impact.","Despite our topline and margin pressures, our business continues to generate significant cash flow. In addition to reinvesting in the business to drive future growth, we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases in the first quarter.","As Steve mentioned, we're taking a close look at our organization, challenging ourselves and the status quo. Our goal is to position the company for enduring profitable growth. We must get back to better leveraging the benefits of our business model, including the entrepreneurial spirit of our franchisees.","We must utilize our considerable resources more efficiently, and we must meet our customers' evolving needs more consistently. I am energized by the challenges before us, and I look forward to working with Steve, Pete and the broader McDonald's system to bring our vision to reality. Thank you.","Now, I'll turn it back to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Chris Stent","Thanks, Kevin. Before we begin Q&A, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2015. As you know, each quarter we provide details around our expectations for several key components influencing annual earnings per share. In light of the upcoming announcement of McDonald's turnaround plan, it was not appropriate to update our outlook in management's prepared remarks or as part of today's 8-K filing. An update on our outlook will be provided in conjunction with the announcement of our plans on May 4, 2015.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Chris Stent","We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows.","The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","A question on the U.S. business. In the U.S., I've heard a lot over the last few months about the need for more simplicity, needing to improve speed, which I think suggests a diagnosis of a throughput problem. But when you look at the underperformance in the comps versus the industry and on an absolute basis, it does suggest a bigger, more pure demand issue.","And so the question is, what's going to be going on over the next couple months to really drive a resurgence in guest counts that maybe more dramatic than simplification? I guess like, are the extended breakfast tests going well? What's the plan there? As far as new products being rolled out more rapidly, like you guys just did the chicken sandwich, is that something we're going to see more of? If you could just kind of talk about that altogether, that will be great.","Stephen Easterbrook","You're absolutely right. There is no one single solution to getting any of our businesses moving. We have strong plans in place. And I guess if I can dissect that question of yours; one is, how we're going to drive demand? And then secondly, how we're going to manage that demand?","The driving demand is going to be driven through both national and local menu news. So we have some strong and some exciting product pipelines ahead. So most recently we've announced the sirloin burger, which we believe will be a favorite with customers and have broad resonance. But also we are liberating the creativity, and I guess the insights of our local markets to develop local food menu items that better resonate with the local customer base. So the demand driving, I believe, can operate at two levels.","That said and done, we've still got to make the entire McDonald's experience just a little easier for our customers and a little easier for our crew, and that's where the simplification piece comes in. And it's not simply the menu simplification, it's what else can we take off the workload of our teams in the restaurants to enable them to focus on what really matters, which is taking care of customers. So menu simplification will certainly help.","There has been the initial phase of that from January, where we have not seen a significant sales uplift from it, but we have seen it provide us with easing of operational complexity. There will be further moves on menu simplification coming up now, because we have a number of tests in place, and we can share those with you as the results become clearer.","But also there is other things we can do to take workload out of the restaurant and just simplify the job of our managers and crews, so they can focus on their frontline role, which is taking care of customers. So two things, driving demand and then meeting demand, and we've got actions on both.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen and Company.","Andrew Charles","Kevin, to put the U.S. and China restaurant closures in perspective, what's the base of company restaurants that are currently cash flow negative? And should we expect these closures to be the first wave and what could be future closures as well?","Kevin Ozan","The restaurants that we closed, that we're announcing that we're closing right now, were all certainly underperforming, not adding significantly to profitability and cash flow. We don't expect a lot more throughout the rest of this year. So you shouldn't expect to see a lot more happen through the rest of the year related to additional closures.","There may be some little charges that, I'll say, come in through the next couple of quarters, some related to incurring costs as we actually close the restaurants, and there may be a few additional restaurants. But you shouldn't expect a lot more significant closings, certainly nothing to the magnitude of the first quarter.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley","Maybe a couple of follow-ups on that, and if you guys defer this to May 4, I understand, but there was no mention of expansion in 2015. Are the old expansion plans kind of still in place, so net-net there would still be some increase in restaurants? And then, somewhat related question, I guess. The $85 million charge from the prior or already previously disclosed refranchising plans, is that coming because you decided to do those on a developmental licensing basis? And if so, maybe talk about that change, in thought of if in fact it was a change.","Kevin Ozan","First, related to expansion. You saw we took everything out from the outlook. Obviously, we're still opening restaurants, but we'll update all the kind of outlook pieces, including expansion, on the call on May 4.","Related to the charges, a couple things. So we referred to one of the pieces of the charge as cost related to write-offs, as we made decisions to sell restaurants to developmental licensees. That'd be consistent with our past practice, as we make decisions to sell, whether its restaurants or countries to somebody. We need to look and see how it's valued and what we believe we can get in return for selling those restaurants.","And as we make a decision and evaluate kind of the fair value versus what we have recorded on our books, it requires us to potentially write down the net book value to get to the cost of the selling price we're going to realize. That's what those amounts relate to. It will be consistent with prior practice. We made some decisions to actually sell some restaurants to developmental licensees, and we need to now record the cost of it. It equals what we expect to realize when we sell those restaurants.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Steve, just a question on franchise relations or maybe the health of the franchisees, however you want to look at it. But it's obviously difficult for us looking in from the outside. On one hand, it would seem like your franchisees are probably among the most successful in quick service, whether it's from sales or a profit standpoint. But at the same time, I can't imagine the recent weakness doesn't drive some frustration.","So I'm just wondering, with that kind of as background backdrop, I mean, what's the greatest pushback or perhaps just maybe suggestions you hear from franchisees in terms of turning around at least the U.S. business? That would be one thing, because I'm guessing they have some pretty good insights.","And secondly, do you typically discuss the initiatives and plans for the system with them ahead of time? For example, like the turnaround presentation in early May, do they get kind of advanced look or do they opine on the initiatives that you plan on putting out there?","Steven Easterbrook","So the overall brand relationship is absolutely fundamental to the ongoing strength. It has been for 60 years, and certainly I want to continue that and champion that. When business is a little tougher, like it is at the moment in the U.S., with cash flows being challenged, yes, frustrations do arise, as you would expect. The wonderful thing about the relationship we have with the operators is that there's a really open dialogue. Their views and our views, we share openly, as we build these plans together. And I don't think that will change.","As you go through turnarounds, I'm going to tell you from my experience in the past in other markets, they are a little bumpy by nature. It isn't just a straight line growth curve. And it does require some bold and decisive decision-making, which on occasions could lead to one or two friction points. And there's one or two things we can learn from one or two decisions we've made, but it doesn't mean the decisions we are making are wrong, far from it.","I am confident in the decisions that Mike's making for the U.S. and I am making at a global level. And the ultimate objective from this clearly is, as you know, with our business model, of the three-legged stool, is that our supply partners, our owner\/operators in the company succeed together. And I would love that to be an operator-led success as well. Nothing would thrill me more.","With regards to what we are looking towards on May 4, we have a number of measures we'll talk to, some of which clearly you won't expect me to talk to now. Some of which will be, we're going to share some broader operating plans at the markets with a broader audience. So some of the work is going on in the markets, as we speak; there will be other elements that we will save for May 4 to share with all audiences at the same time.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Keith Siegner of UBS.","Keith Siegner","Steve, if I could circle back to some of your original points earlier about driving demand and ways to driving demand, you talked about the product. But another increasingly important area is the digital engagement tool. Just wondering if you could give us an update on the launch of a mobile app, maybe some of the details of what functionality you might include in the launch? And then is there going to be this roll of subsequent updates and increased functionality? How do we think about adding in this tool to the driving demand aspect to the equation?","Steve Easterbrook","It is a great question, Keith. It's something we are excited about here, I have got to say. As you probably know in my previous role I was responsible for trying to establish our digital team and division here, and that we've built a highly skilled and capable group of managing that for us.","We are moving, without a doubt, from a world of mass marketing to one I describe as mass personalization. And clearly, technology allows us to do that now, which allows us to build a much more meaningful relationship with our customers, to shift from a transactional relationship into a far more engaging and meaningful, purposeful relationship where we can understand their needs on individual basis rather than a generic basis.","We are building, what we're calling our global mobile app. We will be launching it in the U.S. in the second half of this year. And there are two elements to our digital vision. One is the experience side and the other is the engagement side. The experience is how can we use technology just to make the day-to-day customer experience easier and more convenient. And the engagement side is really more about the fun part of the brand.","So the initial app that we'll be launching will be focusing primarily on the experience, just trying to make the day-to-day customer experience smoother and more convenient. And then, future iterations, which are already building up the pipeline, I have got to say, will further enhance that experience and introduce more elements of fun to it. So I would not really be -- personally, we are not building in a sales build in relation to this for 2015, but we do see it as being a business driver as we look out.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","In past 10-K filings you have disclosed, it looks like that the annual cost to support a typical company-owned U.S. restaurant was about $50,000. I am curious if that number is still accurate. And just as a quick follow-up, on that May 4 date, I am just curious, how did you come to determine that that was an appropriate date to share the turnaround plan details?","Steve Easterbrook","Well, I can take the second one. So the date was -- clearly, this is my seventh week now in position alongside Kevin as well. And you can imagine we have been working pretty hard on this. It wasn't a standing start. We both have our histories we brought into our current positions. May 4 is an important opportunity for us, partly because -- so we are moving flat-out to build the meaningful plans that are merit sharing with you.","Also, that week we have our leaders from around the world in here as well. And is a great opportunity to share it with them, at the same time we share it with the broader audiences. So that date just sits comfortably in the cadence of action that we're building here.","Kevin Ozan","And then regarding your question on kind of G&A per restaurant, in the U.S., we have said it's about $45,000 per restaurant. Internationally, it varies by market, but it's generally in that $45,000 to $50,000 ballpark.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Steve, to the extent, if you're willing to talk about it today, when you think about your turnaround plan, do you think about them focusing more on the operating part of the business, or is it more of a financial restructuring, or how do you weight those two in importance in your mind?","If you're not willing or less willing to talk about that now, I also wonder about how your own turnaround experiences, maybe it's the U.K. or some other business you have been involved with. What are the important elements in those turnarounds? And are those applicable to this situation or is this very different in your mind?","Steve Easterbrook","Absolutely, unequivocally, this is around driving operating growth in our operating business. Simply put, we want to sell more hamburgers to more customers, more often, around the world. So this is going to be a growth-led turnaround. There are things we can do to help that.","And probably to your second point, and just from personal experience, back in the U.K., there were certain things we can do as management and as leaders in this business to help us run a more effective operating business.","So the sort of things that I have been looking at is around our organizational structure, around our ownership mix, about how we can get that drive in the restaurants most effectively, and about how we best use our resources. And you may have heard me say before, any leader in any business, there are typically three resources that we have at our disposal. There is human resource; there is financial resource; and there is time.","So we're challenging ourselves to how we can most effectively use those three resources to prioritize them behind the areas they're going to deliver the greatest return and the greatest growth in this turnaround.","Chris Stent","Next question David Palmer from RBC.","David Palmer","Steve, just a question on premium and value. On the value side, particularly as you focus on the U.S., how confident are you that regional value marketing is going to be the way, going forward? And how confident are you that this will be effective enough to replace what the Dollar Menu did for McDonald's over a decade?","And on the quality side, I know this is a journey which you are embarking upon and you are seeing a little bit in the second quarter, but how good is good enough? For instance, one would have no doubt that if you had a chicken sandwich as good as Chick-fil-A, that that would sell well. But I'm just trying to get a sense of your commitment and how you're benchmarking, and where your goals are on quality.","Steve Easterbrook","So on the value piece, I would say, regional clearly has a part to play, but they need to balance. And although that Mike and the U.S. team are working on that balance between getting national-driven value where we can use our scale and that economy of scale on a national level, along with freeing up the regions to really identify the menu items that matter most in their geography, given maybe their climates and given affordability issues. It very, very much differs, region by region. So there will be a balance to play on value. We haven't quite found that equation yet. But we have been working hard to unlock it.","In terms of quality, our benchmark is ourselves. What we are working on now and what Mike and the menu team is working on is how could we deliver a better McDonald's menu? So we are very proud of our core products. What can we do to enhance the quality, both direct quality, and also the quality perception as we develop new items. Again, our benchmark is ourselves. And our customers are guiding us on that. So we believe if we can bring great quality products at the value of McDonald's that is the equation that will drive growth.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","So looking at a number of initiatives, whether it's on the improving sort of employee benefits and wages, or improving the quality of products, theoretically there would be a cost associated with most of these. And how do we think about it from a high level versus the plan to absorb those costs versus push that onto the consumer through pricing in the company system?","And then as these cost pressures on ingredient side would float to franchises and then wages, there could be some over effects for McDonald's. And then other larger players who are making similar moves, just helping them manage through that without necessarily passing all of it on.","Kevin Ozan","The minimum wage cost, as well as all other costs certainly impact how we look at pricing, how we look at our margins. We have talked about with the minimum wage that it will impact our margins in the near term. But there is a lot of benefits to it, and that it will be able to enhance our competitiveness in the marketplace. Our thought is that our turnover will decrease. We'll be able to attract and retain the best employees.","So while there's a near-term cost to some of those, we also look at the benefits. And the market will help dictate to us what kind of pricing we're able to get related to some of those costs. But we look at a lot of this as, what do we need to do to make sure that we have got the business set up to be able to drive top line sales. And those are some of the pieces.","Steve Easterbrook","Just one piece to add to that as well is, I talked about simplicity and simplification. Complexity typically adds costs, in one way, shape, or form as well. So I know Mike and the team are working hard to try and strip either the non-value-added activity out of the restaurants, or make cuts as far away from the consumer as possible, just to free up a little bit of room on the P&L, so we can mitigate one or two of the inherent inflationary costs that we face.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","One little detail, and then I guess a bigger question. The detail is, I may have missed it, but could you give us the China comp? And then the bigger question is, just going back to the store closures, can you give us a sense, were they more likely to come from later cohorts as stores, as in, is there some evidence that maybe the store growth that we've seen over the last couple of years probably may have led to a point of kind of over saturation?","I guess, in general, when I look at turnarounds in this industry, they usually do include a fairly significant amount of asset rationalization. So I'm just trying to get a sense of the sort of growth rate going forward that you would expect to see, and how you think about the stores? Maybe some of the more recent development decisions were not ideal?","Kevin Ozan","Regarding China's comp for the quarter, it was negative 4.8%. So that's the China question. The other, regarding kind of optimizing assets, what I would tell you is we've been reviewing our restaurant portfolio around the world to ensure that we're set up to grow successfully in the future. So that review resulted in these decisions to close the 350 underperforming restaurants, primarily in Japan, U.S., and China.","In China, a lot of those openings were, I'll say, between 2009 and 2012, where they have been consistently underperforming. Our sales estimation processes probably weren't as great during those years, but we now have better tools and a better processes so that our sales estimation processes have been better. Japan, they are generally heavy loss-maker restaurants that we're closing, so that will help the portfolio.","And we're pretty much complete with that review. Like I said before, there may be some limited additional closures. There may be some limited additional charges. But the magnitude of any additional charges will not be anything close to what we have got in the first quarter.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Will Slabaugh, Stephens.","Will Slabaugh","Just a question around the menu globally, and maybe even more applicable here in the U.S. Can you talk about the balance of launching new items that are enticing and different enough to actually drive new people, or maybe lapsed guests into your restaurants that's been lacking a little bit in the past number of years versus your plan to simplify the menu?","Steve Easterbrook","So I think there is probably three elements to this, actually, Will. So one is our core menu, which is still our fundamental engine of growth. These are $1 billion brands. A handful of products are $1 billion brands, right, and are much loved, so we are working hard to reinvigorate the consumers' love and demand for that.","On the new items, two elements, some is launching permanent new items, and some is just using LTOs. Again, they both play a different role. You can only absorb so many new permanent items because, then that's -- clearly they demand a permanent place on menu boards. And that does can typically add up additional complexity.","LTO can provide some funds. So you're talking four, five, six-week promotional activity around themes a bit. It could be around World Cup soccer. It could be around the Olympics. It could be around the time of year and the seasonal events. That just makes yourself interesting. That rewards existing customers who may want to try something different for little while and then return to their favorites.","So that's always a balance, because you're part of what we're working on with our marketing leads, certainly in the major markets, is to understand how that best balance works. If we lurch too far one way and streamline it, we don't have enough new and enticing news out there. If we go the other way, it becomes a little frenetic and customers can't follow, and the restaurants find it hard to execute.","But there is not a science to this, but all very important, but primarily, core, meaningful new menu additions, and then introducing some fun on occasion through LTOs, just to spice up the market a little bit.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Going back to Jeff Farmer's question about the timing of the meeting, I guess, it felt like you guys are going to spend a little bit more time, Steve, since you haven't been there very long to kind of get the plan together, based on some of your comments at the New York meeting. So I guess, can you talk about, is the meeting on May 4 meant to present the comprehensive sort of final plan that you have come up with or is this more sort of a first look at some of the things that you are working on, and that you will build from there? Can you help frame that a bit?","Stephen Easterbrook","Yes. On the call, we will be sharing the initial details of the turnaround plan. Clearly, I don't want to say too much about it, because that's the reason we are having the call on May 4. We have selected that date because we believe those initial plans will be well enough baked out that it will be meaningful news to all the audiences that have an interest in what we're doing at McDonald's.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies.","Andy Barish","Just one I guess quick follow-up, and then a financial question. On the product news, Steve, do you think the brand has in the research you're looking at or doing, do you think the brand has credibility on the premium side? I mean, there have been some efforts, obviously, with most recently reintroducing chicken tenders, in the past on premium burgers and wings that haven't really worked. So I guess, what's the current thinking on that? And then, the financial question for Kevin was, you referenced higher lease costs and the franchise margin decline. Is there something going on with rent escalations, or something above average, I just don't recall seeing that historically in your explanation.","Stephen Easterbrook","For premium quality, I mean I often describe, because it's possibly the most democratic, with a small d brand in the world. And what customers love the world over, and none more so than here in the U.S., is how they can buy into aspirational quality products, but at a McDonald's price. They don't have to pay over the odds for it.","And when we were on our game, and we have all elements of our business working well, our service experience, our digital engagement, the cost account quality, and new food news, then all those components really do add value to the customer experience, and their perception, their assessment of us.","So yes, there is room for it. We have to be competitive in the marketplace, but we can bring great quality. So for example, removing the antibiotics out of our chicken supply chain across the next two years is a move that customers value, because we can bring to them quality ingredients and quality menu items at the McDonald's affordable prices. And they encourage us to do more of that.","And we will continue, particularly here in the U.S., as Mike brings to life the food agenda that he has his part of his vision for the business, we will continue to make moves such as that to bring premium quality food at everyday prices. And again, the sirloin burger is a great example of that. It's a premium beef cut at McDonald's prices, and looking forward to customers' response to that.","Kevin Ozan","And then, Andy, related to the lease costs, to your point, we normally have rent escalation, so it's not necessarily anything new. Some of it is escalation. But more of it really relates to sales. We've talked about before, it's a topline game, so negative comp sales clearly put pressure on our margins. And when we don't have that sales leverage that's significantly impacts margins. So that's really the bigger impact.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco of Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","I think what stuck out to me also was a couple of the growth year markets where you're opening a lot of stores also seem to be some of the weaker comp stories this year. I understand it's a long-term plan, some of those openings. But, is that somewhat of a foreshadowing, I guess, for 2016, perhaps the lower comp environment that we're in now? Should it be presumed that we are going to probably see a little bit more pragmatic and slower development in those markets in response, especially from the franchise community more so or the emerging franchise community in China, does that disrupt it at all?","Peter Bensen","Yes, there is really no correlation between looking at the store growth numbers in the release and the comp sales. We have acknowledged in some of the major markets, we've got some turnaround activity to undertake. And we are undertaking those obviously with the belief and the confidence that there is long-term growth potential in those markets.","And restaurant development is not something that we kind of turn on and turn off with a switch, because there is a pipeline involved. There is some permitting to restaurant opening. It's a several month to multi-year process, depending on the country. So you shouldn't be drawing any correlation between those two, and as we'll be able to talk about it in a little more detail on May 4, the efforts around turning the topline in the business are of utmost focus, especially in those markets where comps are weakest.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe","Just the two part question, if I may. Steve, as you've kind of seen all the research that McDonald's has had, was there maybe one or two big things that consumers were telling you about three to four years ago that you needed to change, and you could have kind of prevented the decline in the sales? And I ask this question really in the context of what were those preventable factors, if you will, and is the organization kind of in a place where it can act on some of that right research?","And secondly, if I may, which I guess is a little bit unrelated, there has been at least some illusion that there could be separate expressions of the McDonald's brand through the drive-through and the in-store experience, at least in the U.S. And Create Your Taste is certainly maybe moving in that direction, but if you could give us some light in terms of how some of the drive-through optimization tests are going around the U.S.?","Stephen Easterbrook","So looking back three to four years, rather than anything we missed through consumer insight, I think perhaps the challenge we let ourselves with, we had four or five growth initiatives working together really through the 2000s, so from '03 to about 2010, 2011, we had a number of different growth platforms that worked. And they worked around the world. Different markets sequence them in different orders, but everything from delivering great quality coffee, which then drove breakfast business, going to extended hours, the re-imaging program, for example, just to name three.","Perhaps what we didn't foresee and responded as well as we could have done ourselves is to create that future pipeline and growth platforms. Now, sometimes the consumer will guide you there, but sometimes you've got to take that into your own hands. And that was probably perhaps something that, as we look back through our history, we wish we could have done a little better.","The one trend I would say, we're working hard to address now is general consumer desires to be part of something big, but to be treated as an individual. And that's where the whole personalization piece comes in. Whether that's the way we engage and communicate with customers, which is, I believe, technology will help us get there, where we'd have a much more personal relationship at a level that customers are happy with. But also on the menu side and that's where the customization of food comes in.","And then on to your second point on Create Your Taste, one of the beauties we have here is we have an ability to test these things out and learn. So Create Your Taste, for example, is an option within our broader McDonald's experience in the future ambition. We have a really concerted push on this in Australia, and we will have one or two markets up and running within the U.S. And we will respond, we will be able to see from consumers' response to that pretty quickly how that in-store experience builds out and plays out.","And then, again, relating to your second point, how that then works through the drive-through, and time will tell, but we have a number of other ways that we can perhaps customize our menu or personalize our menu, that we're also are working on.","So we have test sales going on around the country and around the world, to better learn how we can best meet that consumer need is around personalization. It is powerful. We believe we can deliver against it. And our confidence is when we start to really connect on that level and unlock the benefits of personalization to 69 million customers a day, that will have a significant impact and drive long-term, sustaining growth.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","I just wanted to ask about the early stages of the efforts to drive results to restructuring of the field level operations. I think that's something that was done in the U.S., I don't know, a quarter or two ago. And I believe that was maybe doing it by region or better matching up the corporate with the local consumer preference. Could you just let us know what you're hearing from the field level operations, please?","Stephen Easterbrook","Yes, so Mike made a very deliberate move at the backend of last year to announce a streamlining of the organization structure. I mean over time, the structures can build up. And really, he took a very concerted view of that. Really took out one level, one layer between corporate and then the regions, and these were 22 regions around the U.S.","What that has done it is ask for a different role of performance out of our general managers and our operator leaders in the regions, and a different way of engaging and a speed of decision making in the center. So as the teams are embedding with these new accountabilities and new responsibilities, we were in that transition stage.","I don't think we've got everything humming perfectly right now, but nor would I expect us to. It's a significant change for the organization. It's absolutely the right one to have made, and has my full support. And we want to shorten the time period to get superb execution of the new roles and responsibilities in that structure.","Chris Stent","The last question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","Steve, just a high-level question about your vision. I think you mentioned that you wanted to remove some of the legacy thinking and change the mindset of the organization. I was wondering if maybe you could share some examples of some of the legacy thinking that needs to be changed. And then, maybe secondly, based on the seven weeks or so you've been in the job, maybe talk a little bit about how ready you think the organization or the system is to embrace some of that change in thinking?","Stephen Easterbrook","That's a nice, soft one to end with, David. Thank you. Right. So when I talk about legacy thinking and legacy attitude, I mean we have been phenomenally successful for 60 years. And there's so many good reasons for that. And there is much of that I would not ever wish to change or challenge. It's very precious to us, and will stand as in good stead for the next 60 years. However, there's a certain conservatism and incrementalism that builds into that.","And again, as a company, that has not necessarily been a bad thing. But when you do need to make a step change, our organization doesn't naturally go there. It needs to be led there. And in my experience at McDonald's, whenever we've made substantial decisions and substantial changes, we are wonderfully adaptable once that has been spelled out. But we won't naturally take ourselves there as an organization.","So with the team around me, we're challenging some of the conventional thinking on multiple fronts, and some of that we'll be able to share you over time. With regards to whether the seven weeks will get people into a state of readiness, I think there's a hunger and an interest in our business to embrace change. So I mean I hear it as I get into the markets, hear it from younger operators, and I think there is a pull and a hunger in the field for what are we going to stand for, where we're heading, and how are we going to get there.","And I am not new to most of the McDonald's system. I am new in position. I totally recognize that. And different expectations and accountabilities come with that, but I think my track record and my history in McDonald's is relatively well known around the place. And therefore, I don't come as a complete surprise. So I look forward to sharing more on May 4 and ongoing.","Chris Stent","We're nearing the top of the hour, so I will turn it over to Steve who has a few closing comments.","End of Q&A","Stephen Easterbrook","Thank you, Chris. Again thank you everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I want to reemphasize our commitment to reenergizing the business on moving more quickly and assertively to meet the demands and the needs for our more than 69 million customers every day around the world.","I am confident in our ability to make the right move to reset McDonald's as a modern, progressive burger company that provides a contemporary experience for our guests. We will keep driving towards this vision as we build the business and brand and deliver long-term value for customers and shareholders. I look forward to sharing the initial details of our turnaround plan with you on May 4. Thanks again to you all. And have a great day."],"13881":["McDonald's Corp.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Michael Flores","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan.","Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast. Now before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments today. Both documents are available on investor.McDonalds.com, as or any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. 2017 was a very strong year of performance for McDonald's. Our results demonstrate we successfully completed the transition from turnaround to growth. Our momentum is broad based across the McDonald's system. There are strong leadership teams in place, our business is fit for purpose and grown platforms underpinning our strategy of residential customers and markets around the world.","Our top priority in 2017 was serving more customers more often and we did. We grew cash counts by 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% in the full year, with all business segments positive. This is our first full year of positive comparable cash count growth since 2012. ","Comparable sales for the quarter grew 5.5% marking our 10th consecutive quarter of growth. Full year comparable sales increased 5.3%, our best performance in six years. We made significant advances with our franchise strategy in 2017 culminating with our largest developmental licensee transaction China and we reached our target of refranchising 4,000 restaurants per year ahead of schedule.","Customers tell us that we are notably enhancing their McDonald's experience by being more attentive to their needs and serving hotter and fresher food. Our overall customer satisfaction surveys scores continue to improve in 2017 with most markets achieving gains across multiple elements of brand perception particularly friendly service and taste and quality of food. As a result, six of our top eight markets grew market share with the UK, Canada and Japan leading the way. ","We are pleased with our progress but certainly not satisfied. There is more potential in the marketplace and in our plan and we are leveraging our considerable size and scale to unlock it. We are sharper and more focused in the way we organize bank and act and we are confident in our ability to execute with excellence to drive sustainable long-term growth. Kevin will walk you through more details about our financial performance in the fourth quarter and the full-year. ","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve. By all measures our strong performance in 2017 shows that we have momentum. Enabling us to drive our business innovate and invest in our growth so we can compete effectively in today's globally marketplace. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement in soft global markets and on top of strong prior year results. ","Comp sales in guest counts were positive across all of our operating segments with overall results driven by strong performances in the U.S., the UK, Japan, Canada and China. U.S. comp sales increased 4.5% for the quarter compared with the rest of the QSR sandwich competitor set which was relatively flat. ","Comp sales for the international lead segment rose 6% with positive results throughout that segment. High growth comp sales increased 4% led by China's strong performance along with positive results across the segments European markets partly offset by some near-term challenges in South Korea. ","In foundational markets comps were up 8% in addition to Japan's strong performance comps were positive in each of the segment's geographic regions. I also want to mention that starting with fourth quarter 2017 comparable sales in our foundational segments and on a consolidated basis have been adjusted to exclude the impact of Venezuela due to its hyperinflationary status and the significant impact that it had on the fourth quarter. We recap the comp sales for the first three quarters of 2017 to exclude Venezuela and reflected those in the earnings release to provide comparable amount. ","As we move into 2018 we will continue to direct our efforts and resources towards driving the convenience and menu innovation that will help maintain this topline momentum. ","On a reported basis earnings per share for the quarter declined 40% to $0.87. These results include a onetime net tax cost of approximately $700 million for the impact of U.S. tax reform. The $700 million net cost consist of 1.2 billion of cost for the deemed repatriation of our undistributed foreign earnings partly offset by a benefit of $500 million for the revaluation of our differed tax assets and liabilities to the lower U.S. tax rate. Excluding the impact of tax reform diluted earnings per share increased 19% to $1.71, reflecting strong comp sales, G&A savings, a reversal of a tax valuation allowance in Japan and a 27% tax rate. This tax rate was lower than expected because of tax law changes in some countries outside the U.S. in the fourth quarter.","We ended 2017 with franchise restaurant representing 92% of our total restaurant base, up from 81% three years ago. As a result, franchise margins now comprise more than 80% of our total restaurant margin dollars. For the fourth quarter franchise margin dollars increased across all segments reflecting sales driven performance and the shift to a more heavily franchise system. The franchise margin percent in the U.S. remained flat, due to higher depreciation cost related to our rollout of experience to the future.","Our company operated restaurant base now consists of a little over 3,000 locations, spread across the U.S. international lead and high growth segments. The U.S. and international lead markets accounts for about 75% of the company operated margin dollars. ","For fourth quarter, consolidated company operated margins improved 40 basis points primarily due to our refranchising efforts. Company operated margins in the U.S. declined 150 basis points, due to higher labor costs which reflected both wage pressures and our continued investments and deployments of our key initiatives along with higher commodity costs. ","Commodity costs in the U.S. for the fourth quarter were up a little over 1.5% versus last year while our full year U.S. grocery basket increased 60 basis points. In terms of menu pricing our fourth quarter pricing was up 3% year-over-year, which was above food away from home inflation of 2.5%. The menu price increases we took in the fourth quarter were part of our broader strategic pricing reset of the menu board ahead of the launch of our $1, $2, $3 menu in early January. By the end of the first quarter this year we expect our pricing to be back below food away from home inflation.","For the international lead markets commodity costs were up about 3% for the fourth quarter and 2% for the year, with menu prices up about 2% year-over-year. G&A for the year was down 7% in constant currencies, in line with the guidance we provided at the start of the year. I'll put these things in the perspective relative to our G&A savings target in a few minutes when I review our updated outlook for 2018.","Finally, other operating income increased nearly $60 million for the quarter, primarily due to the one-time reversal of the valuation allowance in Japan that I mentioned earlier.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Kevin. As our results demonstrate, McDonald's is much more agile and able to move at a pace needed to address the needs of today's customers. With the introduction of our velocity growth plan last March we aligned and mobilizes the McDonalds system. We began actually straightaway and by the end of the year we made substantial progress in the eyes of our customers. We are serving more customers as we retain those most loyal to our brand, regain visits from those who have been coming less often, and convert the casual to committed customers. We have grown sales across the full breath of our menu with great tasting value offerings, delicious core selections such as our Big Mac and exciting premium sandwiches with a wide range of flavor profiles. ","With relevant menu choices for our most price sensitive customers we have strengthened consumer perceptions of McDonald's as a place to find a tasty and affordable meal. Across the system our markets have increased the range and appeal of our food and real bundles offered everyday at compelling price points. ","At [indiscernible] in France offers premium quality and a very affordable portion size. The saver menu in the UK and value picks in Canada provide a range of affordable food for snacking and adults. ","In the U.S. from a big troop [ph] of $5 combined with $1 any size found in beverages provides customers the opportunity to bundle and share with incremental visits and average share in the quarter. ","Programs like McPick 2 for $5 and Germany's tasty McDonald's featuring both taking core sections for EUR1.99 not only appeals to the price conscious consumer and drive incremental traffic they re-introduce customers with the great taste and quality of the food at a core of our menu. ","Across the model systems we have increased a full and excitement via iconic food customers identify with our brands, the Egg McMuffin, the quarter pound of a cheese, chicken McNuggets, French fries and of course our world famous BigMac which is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We have reaffirmed that customers crave this food and the core of our menu still drives growth. ","Maintaining greater strength in our core menu platform has allowed us to venture further into exciting and compelling new offerings such as all-day breakfast which is satisfying customers and driving growth for McDonald's in the U.S., Australia and Canada. We also recently launched Buttermilk Crispy Tenders in the U.S. which contributed in a meaningful way to our sales performance for the quarter. ","Markets that have already modernized their restaurants and have the capacity and creditability to promote premium beef and chicken sandwiches. Such as the Signature collection in the UK and Seriously Chicken in Canada which is driving brand perceptions towards higher and profitable top line growth. ","[indiscernible] for our customers who access our great taste include we are providing them with greater flexibility and choice in how they order pay and are served their food. ","In 2017, we left from piloting delivery with UberEATS reaching 200 restaurants in Miami, Tampa and Orlando, so offering our customers the convenience of great McDonald's food delivered from 7,000 more restaurants in 21 different countries around the world. With our market in Asia and Middle-East where we've often delivered for many years we are now delivering meals from over 10,000 restaurants more than one quarter of the systems restaurants. ","Delivery orders tends up above average check size by 1.5 to 2 times and with high customer satisfaction we are seeing solid repeat business from those who try it. ","During the fourth quarter delivery gained traction and emerged as a meaningful contributor to our comparable sales in several of our largest markets. In many of our markets we've scaled the experience of the future platform providing our customers a more seamless, personalized and enjoyment experience with digital menu boards, self-order kiosk, greater hospitality and a modernized look. ","They are telling us they like the new McDonald's better. They are rewarding us with more frequent visits and they are spending more on average when they do. ","We deployed experience the future for ALGF in about one-third of the restaurants in the McDonald's system, including nearly 3000 restaurants in the US. Customers increasingly expect to engage with brands by apps on their mobile phones and in the US alone we have over 20 million registered users of the McDonald's mobile app. We are well positioned to capitalize on that user base. ending 2017 with 20,000 restaurants around the world offering mobile order on pay. I'm proud of our team's work we achieved that milestone from a standing start in just over 10 months. ","While still very early with customer usage we're encouraged by digital orders as we're seeing higher average check size and greater customer satisfaction among the customers. In particular many customers are appreciating the added convenience of curb side pickup. ","Now as we're starting 2018 our focus is on executing our velocity growth plan. We will continue to provide customers an improved experience and greater choice in how they order, pay and serve their food. We have opportunities in 2018 to raise consumer awareness of the enhanced convenience available with delivery and mobile order on pay.","In the coming months we've initiated marketing campaigns that encourage more customers to enjoy these expanded options to engage with McDonald's. As we do we're optimistic this will contribute to the momentum of our business. With nearly 37,000 restaurants in a 120 countries McDonald's has a distinct scale advantage and significant potential. Over the course of 2017 [indiscernible] markets throughout the United States and around the world. We could see first-hand how our local teams are leveraging the benefits of being part of the larger McDonald's system and delivering on that in ways that matter most to the customers in their communities.","The contemporary d\u00e9cor of well-trained crew members we saw in markets such as the UK, Canada and Poland demonstrate how successful we've been in enhancing the overall customer experience in a modernized restaurant, where customers have better experience perceptions of our brand improve sales increase and guest counts grow. In Italy we saw the results of a strong focus on the operational excellence. Customers appreciate the quick friendly service and great tasting food they receive which has dramatically changed the trajectory of our business in the market.","With this accelerated growth we enjoyed its best year of sales since 2006. Cost [ph] has been a system leader in the development and evolution of self-order kiosks at the customer convenience and solutions for bottlenecks during high volume periods. During our visit last fall we saw how our French team has led in hospitality and table service across the market, to further elevate the customer experience and open up capacity. Service in the bases like these on top of their menu and value platforms have helped the market achieve an all-time high in market share.","Restaurant employees in Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires demonstrate an outstanding commitment to hospitality. While visiting the [indiscernible] I experienced first-hand the passion, energy of our crew and managers as they embrace [indiscernible] an innovative program creating a new service focused culture, is making a real meaningful difference for customers. ","The confidence we have in the business continues to grow and I can say that our franchisee share our optimism. Buoyed by this confidence and the benefits the franchisees and the company will see as a result of U.S. tax reform we are further accelerating our investment in experience of the future in the U.S. We will bring EOTF to nearly 4,000 additional U.S. restaurants in 2018 resulting about half of our U.S. restaurants being completed by the end of this year. This is no small feat. ","While our franchisees are confident about our plan for the future they also acknowledge this is a major undertaking, that will require significant investment of time, focus and leadership to execute well. And clearly it will require significant financial investment too. ","Between the company and our franchisees over the next two years we will invest approximately $6 billion to transform the U.S. business. The impact will extend beyond the new equipment d\u00e9cor we are bringing to restaurants. This is an investment on our local communities as a benefit of these projects which extends construction crews and supplies. We also will continue to demonstrating our commitments to our people as we look at enhancing the training and development opportunities now offered through our Archways to Opportunity program.","We did all this in partnership with our owner operators, with confidence and a firm commitment that the payoff will be a better stronger McDonald's delivering a vastly improved customer experience and sustained profitable growth.","Now Kevin would share additional details about our outlook for 2018.","Kevin Ozan","With the progress we made in 2017 our business is strong heading into 2018. Over the last few quarters I have been messaging that our 2018 results will be choppy due to the refranchising of several markets in 2017 and the $100 million of depreciation benefit in china and Hong Kong in 2017, associated with the refranchising of those markets.","Looking forward we expect 2018 results to be even a little more choppy, with U.S. tax reform and a new level recognition accounting standard that went into effect January 1, this year. On revenue recognition while the new accounting standard will have no impact on our cash flows the change will affect the way we recognize revenue for initial franchise fees that we received, for new restaurant openings and new franchise terms. Previously we recognized initial franchise fees when we received them, upon opening new restaurants or granting a new franchise term.","Beginning in 2018 we will recognize that income over the life of the franchise term. For this year we expected this change to have a negative impact of about $50 million on our consolidated franchise revenues and franchise margins. ","I talked to you about the impact of U.S. tax reform on our 2017 results and I'll spend a couple of minutes walking through how we expect the full impact of business going forward. All of this is based on available information and our current estimates which we know could change as further clarifications provided and our analogies are finalized. ","From an earnings standpoint we expect our effective tax rate for 2018 to be 25% to 27%, down from our historical range of 31% to 33%. Our global blended rate will be higher than the new U.S. rate due to taxes that we pay outside of the U.S. which currently average close to 30%. ","From a cash flow standpoint, we expect an incremental benefit of 400 million to 500 million annually prior to any reinvestment. A few points to put this in the perspective. First, we historically have not had a large amount of cash held overseas. So, the new law will not result in us suddenly bringing back a lot of cash. Second, this incremental cash flow represents less than 10% of our historical annual operating cash flow of roughly $6 billion. Finally, we have not been capital constrained in the past, so we expect our capital allocation priorities to remain consistent with what they have been. ","First, to reinvest in existing restaurants and invest in opportunities to grow the business; second, to pay dividends, and third, to repurchase our stock. Having said that we now expect to return about 24 billion to shareholders for the three-year period ending 2019 which is at the high end of our previously stated target. ","From a business operation standpoint, we expect our U.S. franchisees in general to also benefit from tax reform. Given the ongoing strength of our franchisees existing cash flow this benefit should enhanced our ability to invest in and execute on the velocity growth plan. ","Next, I want to take a moment to review the progress we've made on our financial targets around refranchising and G&A. During 2017 we completed transactions in the Nordics, Taiwan, China and Hong-Kong which, enabled us to reach our targets to refranchise 4,000 restaurants. ","We begin 2018 ready to operate under the streamlined and more heavily franchise business model that we set out to create under our turnaround plan. While we do expect to continue to refranchise some of our company owned restaurants in our major markets like the U.S. international league markets we anticipate the gains on sales of restaurants in 2018 will be down roughly 30 million to 40 million from 2017 as our refranchising activity begin to slow down. ","Regarding G&A we developed the targets savings of $500 million from our base of $2.3 billion at the beginning of 2015. Through 2017 we have realized about $300 million of net savings. In order to achieve those net savings, we save significantly more than $300 million on a gross basis related to maintenance spending. And then reinvested some of those savings primarily in technology and digital. So, at the same time we saved cost overall, we've also shifted more of our remaining spend from maintenance spending to investing in activities that drive growth. ","For 2018, we expect G&A to decline by 1% in constant currencies. This reflects savings from our refranchising transactions and a reset of our incentive compensation offset by one-time cost associated with our bi-annual worldwide operator convention to final year of our Olympics sponsorship and our upcoming headquarters office move, as well as continued spending in technology. We expect to fully realize our targeted $500 million of net savings in 2019. As we have become more efficient with the G&A required to run the business we will continue to invest in activities that we believe can accelerate growth. At the same time, we will continue to exercise strong financial discipline in the use of our valuable resources. ","Moving on to capital, we expect to end 2017 with capital expenditures of nearly $1.9 billion. This was slightly higher than we anticipated at the beginning of the year because of currency exchange rates and because we were able to complete more EOTF projects in the US than planned, ending the year with 3000 EOTF restaurants as Steve mentioned.","In 2018 we expect to spend about $2.4 billion of capital, approximately 1.5 billion or two-thirds of our capital will be dedicated to our US business, primarily focused on further acceleration of experience of the future. Of the remaining capital budget about half is earmarked for new restaurant openings and half is allocated to reinvestment as we continue to expand the experience of the future in markets outside the US. Our capital will contribute to about 250 new store openings while capital from developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute to another 750 openings for a total of a 1000 planned new restaurants.","Finally, for 2018 we anticipate some currency tailwind primarily in the first half of the year. At current exchange rates we expect a positive impact of $0.07 to $0.09 in the first quarter and $0.23 to $0.25 for the full year. As you know over the last month exchange rates have fluctuated more significantly than we've typically seen and we don't know what will happen to rest of the year. So please take this as directional guidance only. ","We've made significant progress in our business. The path that we're on with the velocity growth plan along with the investments we're making in our future position the company for sustainable long-term growth. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term financial targets beginning in 2019 and now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","As you can see our business is growing. It is fundamentally sound and we're confident about our future. We have returned the business to growth and have achieved momentum with comparable sales. 2017 was our best performance in six years. Customers are rewarding us with visits because the actions we're taking to serve them great tasting meals, offer friendly hospitality and provide more choice in how they order, pay and serve their food. The three biggest draw to McDonald's system is continuing to make bold and aggressive investments in our most promising growth platforms. A strong signal of the confidence we have in our future.","We're also looking forward to 2018 because there're many opportunities that will bring the building brand excitement with our customers and our people. This spring we'll gather at our worldwide convention in Orlando with nearly 14,000 owner operators supplies employees in the McDonald's system. This will be a tremendous opportunity for building our enthusiasm as we celebrate our progress and then rally together to pursue our even greater ambitions in the years ahead. ","As I mentioned this is the 50th anniversary of the BigMac a one of a kind sandwich invented by Jim Delligatti one of our earliest McDonald's franchisees. We have exciting plans to celebrate the many fans who remained so passionate all these years later about this iconic burger. ","Our flagship Chicago restaurant is receiving a dramatic makeover and it will offer great convenience and hospitality to our customers when it reopens later this year. The modern designs will play our latest technology and decor side, the green space, planters and outdoor sitting and a park for community to enjoy. ","And, I can't wait to take another picture there and advancing the evolution of our culture, when we open our new headquarters in Chicago's West Loop. Moving into the heart of such a dynamic city will put us closer to our customers and energize the McDonald's team. ","We are becoming a better McDonalds and as we do, its driving better results. While pleased with the progress we made in 2017, we have far greater ambitions. We have the right organization and the right plan. The fact always we put in place is delivering growth today, we are confident they will serve as the spring board accelerating our future success. ","So, thanks everyone, and now I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Michael Flores","Thanks Steve, so we will now open up the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions]. And give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions please limit yourself to one question and we will come back to you with follow-up questions as time may allow. Now the first question is from David Palmer with RBC. David?","David Palmer","This is regarding U.S. it wasn't that long ago that surveys that we have done or seen elsewhere had McDonald's U.S. towards the bottom of the pack and if you are -- in the peer set, in things like quality and even towards the middle of the pack and things like value and convenience where you think McDonald's should obviously be winning. Those surveys are probably pretty stale now. You are probably seeing some improvements but perhaps place where you have made the most progress? And then it maybe it makes sense to tie into a market like Canada where you are further along with reimaging and other initiatives, how you think the brand perception can improve from here? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","You are absolutely right, I mean clearly, we see at a market by market that we are very close to all the consumer research and feedback we can get. I mean very simply, I guess you could characterize it into brand perceptions but also operational metrics as well and the two kinds of got to hand it hand. ","What we have seen around the world, and what we are beginning to see in the U.S. is when you look at a brand like McDonald's everything that you do communicates, so the look and feel of the restaurants, the quality and engaging element of our marketing programs, the friendliness of our people and their enthusiasm, technology innovation, you saw us talk about keeping the business for the future as well. ","So, what we are beginning to see is as we can change the broad-based investment both in our people and our restaurants in the menu improvements such as through poultry supply chain with the antibiotics, whether for the clean label nuggets and so on all of these things communicate at businesses on the move and a business that\u2019s heading in the direction that our customers wants us to. ","So, we are certainly encouraged we are seeing some improvement in operational metrics in terms of friendliness, better service in terms of the customers perceptions and then you look at the broader brand metrics like is a brand for -- it is a company for a customer like me for example, so broader brand metrics, and we are beginning to see that mix. begins in the markets that are more advanced and you can look on the more developed markets, markets like Canada as you mentioned UK, Australia but we also see it into a number of our high growth markets where we already have modernized the estate and really repurposed the whole employment preposition countries like Netherlands and Poland and Spain and Italy. We begin to see as each part of progress we make it's just a mix all brand perceptions and also just the taste and quality of the food perceptions go up if you are able to satisfy customers in more environment. ","So, we are encouraged its early days we finish the year in the U.S. with around 3,000 of our restaurants really representing the look and feel that we are proud of going forward and with the further acceleration that we've announced the day, the 2018 we are going to have probably just north half of our state converted into really a great expression of the forward-looking brand McDonald's by the end of 2018. So, we are encouraged but a lot of work to do.","Michael Flores","And next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer. ","Brian Bittner","Can you just give us any insights into any sales benefits if any that you are seeing so far from your national value platform whether you are seeing a change in the industry gap or just incrementality in your business would be helpful. And could you also second to that help us understand that this platform has changed to sales mix from value in any meaningful way in your sales driver's recent history?","Steve Easterbrook","It's really too early for us to give any meaningful feedback on the dollar menu 1, 2 and 3 and it's only been 20 plus days it's been in the marketplace. And when you introduce a platform as strong and that's being built upon for the medium-and-long-term it\u2019s going to take 3 to 6 months for it to fully ebbed in the minds of consumers. ","With that said in terms of the gap we're beginning to see in the marketplace broadly we ended the year in a competitively strong position. We announced in the U.S. a sales number of 4.5%. I think the overall competitive set was pretty much flat I think it was plus 0.2. So, we have noted that over the four quarters of the year the gap has suddenly increased. They are giving there any future direction but it was very encouraging for us that the more illicit the plans that we execute across the market we are making a dent in the competition which clearly gives us further encouragement. ","On a weekly basis I think we outperformed the peer group in 48 out of the 52 weeks across 2017 so again really consistent strong competitive performance marching here in the U.S. We feel good about the dollar menu 1, 2, 3. I mean just as an overall guide we are not seeing a significant or material shift in product mix. we are still seeing average shared growth across the overall business. so, we feel that it's settling in and embedding in well. we've brought in some of the elements which was successful for us in 2017 so that should be the dollar any size fountain drinks, which we know is very powerful and very strong. there were really augmented with some breakfast products and both across beef and chicken menu as well including then also the $3 happy meal.so we're off to a good start. it's very days to comment anything meaningful for it but it's certainly encouraging.","Michael Flores","Next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Kevin, can you speak to a long-term CapEx target you laid out at the Analyst Day back in March and how would expect it to bridge from 2.4 billion in CapEx in 2018 to 1.2 billion ultimately and just kind of in reference to the original expectations for about $1.7 billion per year through 2020. ","And just one clarification as well, you talked about investing in tax savings in your experience for the future. Just want to clarify, you're investing greater than a 55% stake that you originally did in 2017 into the modernized restaurants in 2018?","Kevin Ozan","Okay, Andrew. I'll try and hit all of them, if I forget something you'll remind me, but let me start with the capital. So, you're right when we talked about it at Investor Day back on March 1st, we expected that it would take several years to complete the experience of the future roll out in the US. ","We've now taken the opportunity with the momentum we have and with the operators on board so effectively just pull that forward some. So, what you'll see is a total capital envelop of around $2.4 billion in 2018. You should expect a relatively similar amount in 2019. ","My guess is there will be a little left over in 2020 I hesitate to say it'll be completely done in '19 but it should be significantly completed by the end of 2019. And then probably beginning in 2021 would be the ongoing normal run rate which right now absent anything new that we know about would be in that 1.2 to 1.3 billion range.","So that's how I think of kind of evolution of the capital, it isn't spending more than we originally anticipated it's just moving forward the spends that we're able to complete the EotF projects quicker. ","Same with that investment is as you referred to our 55% hasn't changed, it's just accelerating the timing of some of those projects but our contribution rates, the partnering program we have is consistent with what we talked about. So that hasn't changed, again it\u2019s just the timing aspect we'll be able to get the projects done quicker than we originally anticipated.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to add to that, and Kevin's absolutely right, I just want to put into context the significance of the acceleration that we are describing here. We exit 2017 with around 3000 restaurants fully converted. We started the year with around 700 so 2017 therefore we completed around 2300 projects. so, this is the best part of doubling that rate and again just to put it into context something similar to do in the UK, France and Germany all together in one year. I mean this is a massive undertaking, a massive signal of confidence from all of our operators and ourselves. But the other piece, the devil's always in the detail and our aim isn't just to get 4000 done it\u2019s to get 4000 done very-very well because owner\/operator is committing their money into this and every customer would like to see how the go stand the execution. ","So, for us this is a really significant undertaking ensuring our confidence in the future of the business and the confidence that we have for an infrastructure investment such as this as a result of tax reform I think is worth pointing out.","Michael Flores","Next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Hey thank you, I have one question and then a follow up if I could. The first is actually considering such a strong year I was surprised to hear Steve say that you think you can accelerate the momentum next year. So, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what that means, is that sort of talking about brand perception or do you actually see traffic and comps accelerate and so just trying to understand maybe quantitatively what that commentary means.","And then the second question I had was sort of broad on, was a follow up on the value discussion. I think some of your smaller competitors have tried to be aggressive on value and have seen kind of a worst-case scenario where they maybe get better traffic but there is pressure on check and profit dollars. Could you maybe talk a little bit about how your marketing messaging allows you to drive value traffic but still see higher check averages, is it just your volume of marketing, is it the nature of the messaging just trying to understand how you are able to do this thing from what some of your other competitors are seeing?","Steve Easterbrook","I'll have a step of both of those and Kevin can join me on things I miss. We don\u2019t want to get into any habit of forward projecting if you like but as we enter this year and because we are reviewing our plan, areas of strength, areas of opportunity, the path is delivering and through 2017 delivers -- we exceeded what we expected out of our fan in 2017. That gives us encouragement that we have a number of facets of our business that are working, whether it's the core nuts and bolts focus in the market on the day to day operations, your friendly service, hot fresh food, staffing our restaurants fully, and the real basics of the customer experience but all the way through to the efficient accelerators and the other platforms of growth whether it's through delivery, the emergence of some of our digital and technology and the growth opportunity that has and what we continue to see out of experience the future. ","So, you have heard me talk probably number of times around how we try to layer these platforms of growth upon each other. They don\u2019t all outperform, but if they can just underperforming we go back and take a look and review and look to enhance and want to outperform our expectations. As we enter the year we feel confident that the plans we built and the progress we have in place are going to continue to deliver strong growth. ","As we continue to invest -- you are absolutely right the brand perceptions will undoubtedly improve if we continue to execute to the standard that we set ourselves. So, once we have about a third of our global stakes now fully modernized in the truest sense actually continue that pace. We know that the brand perceptions improve in restaurants is a much more modernized. So that we find, we are confident that the key metrics both the -- if you like the lightening indicators and the leading indicators both the financial metrics as well as the brand metrics will continue to improve.","With regards to value, it\u2019s a market share fight, we don\u2019t see really, I think any significant broader market growth this year. We are certainly not planning on that. So therefore, we know we are in a market share fight and values is where it really does get the street fighting really hits. ","What we feel good about on the marketing side here and particularly if I talk to the U.S. is two things. One, we have great quality and great value items in the $1, $2, $3. If you look at that line up these iconic products the customers are familiar with are confident with and really, I think exudes much of the values and the things around what we stand for as a business and also as we develop our menu. So, as well as offering great value and we think it reinforces the quality perception and taste perceptions that we are looking to move. ","In terms of just the muscle we have, I mean one of the changes that the operators in the company signed up to last year was we were going to divert more money from the local agencies, the local costs, into national, into the national marketing cost. And that is A, more efficient in spend, and secondly, gives us much more universal trout. ","So, I think that makes us somewhat in -- really gives us a differentiating muscle as opposed to any of our competitors. so, I think the quality of the lineup and the financial muscle we have through our national marketing program in general we think will remain very competitive on the value add. ","Michael Flores","Next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.","Chris O'Cull","It looks like the average U.S. company operated store experience have decline year-over-year in the margin profit dollars. I'm curious if franchises experience similar performance and given the level of promotional activity and labor pressure what comps you really need in the U.S. to increase that margin dollar profit?","Kevin Ozan","It's a fair comment because historically we have always set kind of a normal inflationary environment that a 2% to 3% comp would maintain margins. I think clearly today the 2 to 3 isn't enough mainly because of labor pressures. For us it's both on the cost side as well as we are investing in labor to make sure that we deploy all these initiatives in the right way. on the operator side it certainly we have the wage pressures.","Having said all that their cash flow is still doing pretty well right now so, in the U.S. they are near all-time high cash flow so they are able to still invest in the business and move forward will all these EotF projects that we need them to do. So, while there is additional pressure because of labor, the fact that we are growing guest counts and growing account sales is affording the operators with the cash flow that they need to be able to appropriately invest in the business. ","Steve Easterbrook","And just actually just share comps of the previous points as well from Sara's question, if I would continue comment on our marketing shift and to national from local because of the [Indiscernible] we can gain, we've been able to slightly reduce the marketing contribution that goes with the P&Ls of both our operators and our company stores. So again, this is huge in our size and scale not just an advantage to get us share of voice and drive the effectiveness of our programs, but actually, we can do more cost effective and pass on that benefit through the P&L, so it turns out to be a win-win forward of us. ","Kevin Ozan","The only other thing I would reiterate is we have talked about our conscious efforts to invest in some of this labor in the near term. so, some of that investment in our labor as far as to make sure we deploy all these initiatives is a near term phenomenon that we would expect for another couple of quarters but shouldn\u2019t be ongoing then forever if you will.","Michael Flores","The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino ","My question is on delivery in the U.S. and Steve I think you mentioned that is becoming a more meaningful contributor to comp so I was wondering if you would be willing to share some metrics around that, what type of sales lift are you seeing overall and comment on what you've seen in the markets that have been offering delivery for the longest period of time. ","And then lastly if you could also talk about what the franchises are seeing from a margin perspective on those delivery transactions?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I would speak a little more to delivery. I am not going to give any precise commercial information, that wouldn\u2019t be sensible. But I'd like to talk about platforms of growth. We believe we have 5, 6, 7 platforms of growth all working at the same time. Delivery is one of those. So, it's now featuring as a meaningful contributor to the overall sales build we have in the market. We did a really good job at rapidly rolling out delivery across -- well globally but also across the US and we ended with around 5000 restaurants with UberEATS here in the US. So, we got a two-pronged approach for 2018. One is to continue to expand but it won't be at the same rate because we're looking at major cities and open areas and we hit a good number of those early and clearly, we can only expand at the rate that the UberEATS coverage will offer as well. ","But I mean we have a, have a great opportunity to actually just be aware of this and the usage from a customer perspective, the US is a little behind in terms of guest counts but the number of other established markets. so again, what we are doing is kind of the stuff you'd expect us to do for some great best practice sharing, what is it that's driving such high take up in markets like the UK, Australia increasingly so Canada. We're getting some great results also out of Netherlands, out of our growing businesses in Spain and Italy as well. So, we believe we can get the adoption and frequency to increase in the restaurants that are already offering delivery and we will just generally expand that number across the US as the UberEATS coverage expands.","In terms of the franchisee, clearly is a different margin dynamic because there's a fee element that we pay to the provider through UberEATS which compensates for the fact that we don't have some hire drivers, run cars, have all the insurance cost, all the complexity and the complication of that, so that's kind of clearly the consideration balance we have to make. But the reality is this is, we're seeing the vast proportion of this is incremental business. And as long as that business stays incremental then we get an incremental dollar profit as well. It will be a lower margin percent but it's incremental dollars which is ultimately what we're aiming for and frankly we believe we had a bit of a jump on the market here as well with us by leveraging the size and scale.","We will find ourselves very high up if you were to go on to UberEATS in many of the markets now, we'll be one of the early recommended restaurants just because the operation that we run now we can actually get from order to delivery in under 30 minutes pretty much everywhere we are which puts us right at the head of the pack in terms of the convenience that we offer customers.","Michael Flores","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. A question on I guess probably on franchisee sentiments, I mean you talk about massive signal confidence in the franchisees, obviously they're pleased with the sales on that. I am just wondering if you could take a bit about is there any pushback you often hear about the overloads from some of the initiatives going on simultaneously Steve as you mentioned you've got five, six, seven platforms going. so just wondering whether from an ops or a cost standpoint you're getting any focused pushback. and one of those initiatives I'm assuming is fresh beef which even give much color to today I was just wondering whether as an aside you can offer anything incremental in terms of feedback from test or the timing and pace of the rollout that you're expecting which I believe was in the middle of '18. Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yeah, sure Jeff, so franchisee sentiment, clearly, is something we work so closely hand in hand with the owner\/operators. I mean our owner operators knew as our leadership team in the US, they were building a very aggressive and confident plan and they call it in the US the bigger, bolder Vision 2020, so they collectively built this plan knowing that there was a lot tied up into it. ","As we entered the 2018, there is a totally expensive combination of excitement and confidence and also just the anxiety that comes with the workload and commitments that have to be made. So, I would say so much as push back but just the reality is now hitting home, we have got a lot of work to do, both at a local and the restaurants of the owner\/operators and also at a national level to execute some of these priorities. ","But Jerry its nothing that\u2019s are changed and talk about and then really, we are looking to alleviate the anxiety just with some great execution. If we can execute Dollar Menu 1, 2, 3 from the start of the year, we have got a couple of other promotional campaigns coming up soon that why we are really exciting and drive the business. And then if we can get the -- and change the bit of liability through the technology through the mobile app our customers have and also improve on the user experience for example on the self-order kiosk. There is loads of areas we are looking to continuously improve and as we do so our collective confidence grows. But I wouldn\u2019t say the sentiment is any different from any normal human reaction to when you enter a year and you got to work really hard also write some big cheques, always makes you think twice and I understand that and Jerry we are very empathetic to that.","With regards to fresh beef, yes, haven\u2019t spoken so much about this because we are in roll out stage, we are converting a lot of our facilities around the country in order to meet the demand when we go to national launch which should be around May-June tie. So, we really completed the first full wave. We probably have now 2,000 to 3,000 restaurants, which now have the fresh beef or quarter pounders and our signature range. And clearly, we have a phased rollout for the next two to three months. But the feedback we are getting is clearly unique diligence in the operational training in order to get our grill teams familiar with the new procedures, but once they are embedded by crew members are very tactful they learn very quickly. I mean the other -- it's mostly encouraging feedback we are getting is from customers who just love the taste of the fresh beef and the quarter pounder. So, we are getting unsolicited feedback from customers on a notable improvement, so again that just gives further encouragement as we roll this out in the next two, three months.","Michael Flores","The next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy","If I may two questions, one to clarification. On G&A did you intentionally or was it accidentally that you removed the 5% to 10% additional savings beyond '19? And then just as a follow up to some of the questions on the franchise profitability. Based on your conversations how are they thinking about their spread between not just the investments hitting OTS and value but also what they are seeing on a labor front as companies like Starbucks and Walmart has once again taken it upon themselves to pass along savings and raise wages, any color you could provide on that would be helpful.","Kevin Ozan","I'll start with the G&A. So yes, it was conscious that we took out the 5% to 10%. I guess just to reiterate some of the things I said we have been focused on both savings G&A and shifting some of our spend from maintenance to areas that grow the business. ","The way I -- our overall philosophy is to achieve savings as far away as possible from the areas of the business that directly impact our customers. So that\u2019s where we have been focused. We have realized that we are going to need to continue to invest in technology and digital in order to keep up with where the world is going and our customers' expectations. So, we're going to comment to the $500 million but not commit to anything past that. ","We do look at a variety of G&A measures both internally and externally to compare with our peers so we look at G&A as a percent of sales, we look at G&A as a percent of operating income, because effectively the G&A is incurred to grow sales and operating income and I'm not a 100% sure that everyone in the industry classifies all the cost exactly the same way so to me the ultimate measure is looking at operating margin, kind of how efficient are you at bringing revenues down at the bottom line. ","So, we look at all those measures to ensure that we are spending our cost efficiently, we're going to continue our financial discipline. I think over the long term we would expect that our G&A would be at or below 2% of sales but for now we're going to commit to the 500 and just keep reevaluating and keep our discipline. ","Related to the labor cost. It's very early days and each of us is working on the programs that we are building for the benefit of our people so it's no immediate impact we can see but overall, I would say that the fight for talent continues, it's going to get increasingly challenging to attract the talent you want into your business and then you go to work really hard through training and development to retain them. so, the local level owner\/operators company restaurants clearly want to stay competitive on pay but also want to differentiate ourselves through the program such as our trace of opportunities which we are looking to significantly enhance the benefits to our employees from that and also broaden the accessibility beyond the U.S. into a global program as well because we want to make sure that all of our people around the world stand to benefit. So, we remain very close to it and that's actually one of the advantages of a franchising organization such as ours is that when owner\/operator is close to the market as they are very swift to adapt to the changing marketplace. ","Michael Flores","So, we've reached the top of the hour. We will take one more question and that will be from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass ","This question is around return on capital goals. First of all, just the lower tax rate, does that necessarily imply higher dividend even keeping your payout ratio the same or do you tend to sort of smooth that overtime. Anything with leverage ratios as tax reforms or potentially you think about leverage. And then finally you think about sort of overall return on capital goals. I know you are still within that 2019 goal but is it -- given you got line of sight in CapEx spending a couple of years when is the appropriate time to talk about new goals or return on capital for investors to think about under this new all franchise business model?","Kevin Ozan","Let met talk about I guess the various pieces of written on capital that you mentioned since you hit them all. That's a board decision, we will review with them kind of ongoing we didn\u2019t have a new discussion right now related to changing dividend kind of as quick reactions to tax reforms but we certainly will have those discussions as the year progresses in our normal course.","I don\u2019t know that a tax reform in of itself changes dramatically the way we think overall about dividends. we've been committed to dividends for over 40 years, well we're still committed strongly to dividends. We do look at things like payout ratio and so we will continue to look at just as a guide we don\u2019t have a set target but we will continue to look at payout ratio to help inform that decision. We did as you indicated even with our acceleration of CapEx for 2018 and 2019 we're still comfortable in indicating that we'll return about a $24 billion to shareholders through 2019 which was at the top end of our range. ","Leverage ratios you know I think the rating agencies are still working through some of how to look at tax reform and how to think about their model for us right now. We continue to believe that we're at the appropriate credit ratings so we don't have a plan to change our credit rating. That gives us a little bit of room plus or minus in any given year and so as we think about returning it does imply a potentially a little bit you know little bit flexibility in adding some debt and as I indicated our priority still is the same, the first priority is clearly to invest in the business for growth and then we'll consider dividend and share buyback.","Michael Flores","Well thank you, I'll now turn it back over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, just before I close just to add to Kevin's last comment. Just not to lose sight, the fact is our operating business is still the massive generator of cash and there's no doubt tax reform provides an encouraging help post for our owner\/operators and ourselves but growing the business is going to be the primary source of cash growth going forward and that's where we remain focused. ","So just to close up I just want to reiterate our philosophy strategy is working and we really do have high expectations for McDonald's in 2018. We've got strong leadership team and a great commitment and are live over the franchisees, supply partners and employees who make up the three nuggets store the McDonald's system. So, we got great confidence about where we're going to take our business this year and look forward to sharing that with you as we progress, thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes McDonald's corporation investor conference call, you may now disconnect.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, McDonald's USA President, Mike Andres will join us for Q&A.","Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.","Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonald's.com, as are our reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don. Don?","Don Thompson","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. 2014 was a difficult year, during which performance fell short of our expectations. But it was also a building year. As we entered 2014, we were well aware of the obstacles that we faced in terms of growing comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad-based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L.","Now, while some of the challenges were anticipated, others were not, like the supplier issue in Asia Pacific and Middle East Africa, and the volatile operating environment in Russia and the Ukraine. And we experienced shortfalls in our internal plans, particularly in key markets such as the U.S. In response to these shortfalls, we took a number of important steps to lay the foundation for our turnaround. We're acting with a sense of urgency as these steps are critical to addressing current performance and to advancing our longer term strategies.","Specifically, we renewed our focus on our customers with the evolution of our strategic plan. We brought in new talent in several major markets around the world to provide innovative thinking and fresh perspectives. We announced the changes that we are making to the U.S. organization to put decision-making and accountability closer to the customer. We redefined menu choice and personalization with the introduction of the Create Your Taste platform in Australia and the U.S. We focused on the service experience through an increased emphasis on operations excellence and the initiation of our global digital strategy. And we did more to bolster trust in brand McDonald's, because we know that when our customers feel good about us and about eating at McDonald's they visit us more often.","Now, let's turn to 2014 results. In constant currencies, operating income was down 15% for the fourth quarter and 8% for the year. Earnings per share was down 14% for the quarter and 11% for the full year, both in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the higher tax rate and the supplier issue in APMEA, earnings per share for the year would have been down 1% in constant currencies. For the full year, global system-wide sales grew 1% in constant currencies, and global comparable sales were down 1%. Comparable sales were down 90 basis points for the quarter.","Looking to January, comparable sales are expected to be negative due in part to the shift in Chinese New Year and consumer perception issues in Japan. The changes we are making are designed to refocus our system on those areas that matter most to our customers today and for the future. And that starts with deepening our relationship with customers to increase relevance, drive traffic, and position McDonald's for longer term growth. Our actions are guided by our four strategic growth priorities, which are broad enough that markets adapt and focus on those elements most relevant to the local customer basis.","Beyond our existing menu, we are asserting McDonald's burger leadership by offering greater customization and choice. Not only does Create Your Taste provide new menu news that excites consumers, it has the potential to lift sales of core classics, by bringing more customers into our restaurants. At the same time, we are strengthening the menu pipeline to create greater choice at the local level that reflects attributes like taste preferences and demographics, and those things that makes each market unique. Greater localization enables us to take advantage of those attributes and tailor our menu and our marketing efforts to strengthen our relevance and appeal to customers in those regions.","You will also see changes in our customer service models as we work to create more memorable experiences and to deliver unparalleled convenience. For example, multiple order point strategies include self-order kiosk, table service, or mobile order and payments will modernize our customers interact with our brand and quite simply make it easier to get McDonald's their way, whatever that might be.","We're also strengthening the value proposition. We're strategically evaluating pricing relationships across the entry level, core, and premium tiers of our menu. At the same time, we are thinking differently about how to encourage customers to bundle products and use add-on purchases to create a satisfying affordable meal.","We will also see a shift in the way we engage our customers and consumers in general. We are being bold and direct as we talk about what matters most to customers, especially the quality of our menu ingredients with multifaceted efforts like Our Food, Your Questions in markets including the U.S., Canada, and Australia.","Collectively, these changes create the McDonald's Experience of the Future, which brings the work that's happening within each strategic priority together to deliver changes our customers will notice. It builds on the investments we've already made in technology, re-imaging our restaurants, and operations improvement with an increased emphasis on tangible customer-centric innovations for menu and service to profitability grow the business.","We have enduring competitive advantages that have served us well over time, and those advantages are even more relevant today. Our size and geographically diversified restaurant portfolio allow us to test new products and concepts at a local level, and then broadly scale those that are successful, like we've done in the past with beverages and like we are currently doing with Create Your Taste.","McDonald's operates as one single brand, allowing us to focus our energy and resources on evolving the customer experience and changing the way we engage with consumers, while also leveraging the equity inherent in our iconic core products.","Our global infrastructure enables us to tap into a variety of perspectives and expertise. Our franchisees are an integral part of the communities in which they do business. Suppliers bring innovations in their disciplines, and company employees focus on strategic direction to complement day-to-day execution in our restaurants. And finally, our strong financial foundation, which is supported by industry-leading average unit volumes, it enables us to pursue our global growth priorities in every type of operating environment, while returning significant amounts of cash to shareholders each year.","Now, in our July call we outlined the steps required over a 12 to 18 months period to strengthen our foundation and enhance our relevance and appeal to customers. Having reached the six month mark, we're beginning to see signs of progress in some of our priority markets. While specifics vary across the markets, the underlying formula has been very consistent. In 2014, these markets brought in fresh leadership with new perspectives on how to get customers back in the restaurants. They strengthened franchisee alignment in those relationships and reemphasized value and reenergized our marketing approaches.","We're already seeing a shift in Australia which has over 900 restaurants. It started with fundamental improvements in our marketing efforts and across our entire menu and it was enabled by much stronger alignment with our franchisees. We're building on this strong foundation with plans to roll Create Your Taste across the majority of our restaurants by the end of this year. This is first of our priority markets to demonstrate signs of recovery with positive comparable sales and guest counts since September.","It will take longer to see an uptick in the U.S. which has more than 14,000 restaurants across 22 different regions. The changes we announced last year to create a flatter, more nimble organization have opened the door for decisions to be made closer to the customer. Mike Andres is on the call today, and he can share more during the Q&A about the work that's being done to take shape around our menu, marketing, and service, which will enhance our relevance and appeal to customers.","Now, over to Germany; negative trends are beginning to moderate with the month of December marking the highest comparable sales performance in more than two years. While we expect an uneven recovery as market dynamics remain challenging in the near-term, we are focused on driving sales and guest counts by strengthening value offers, highlighting the quality of both core and premium products in our marketing messages, and aggressively pursuing growth opportunities within the family and breakfast businesses.","Our position in Australia, the U.S., and Germany is much like what the U.K. experienced in the early 2000. We can and we will turn around these markets with a balanced approach.","Russia and China are also key markets that are in a recovery mode. While the specific tactics are different, both markets are focused on enhancing our brand image and winning customers back by emphasizing food quality and also celebrating the many reasons to choose McDonald's, such as convenience and affordability.","Fourth quarter comparable sales in China were negative 6.7% due to the lingering impact of the supplier issue. Each month of the quarter showed sequential improvements, reflecting the positive impact of our ongoing customer recovery efforts in the market.","Finally, in Japan, the team continues to work to overcome significant challenges. The market is executing a multifaceted brand recovery campaign, which is designed to rebuild brand trust and strengthen quality and affordability perceptions. While we know these actions will win back customers, history tells us that these efforts would take time to resonate, so we expect continued volatility in the market through most of 2015.","2015 will be a year of regaining momentum globally. We expect further growth amid the pockets of success we're already seeing. However, it will take time, especially in our larger markets for customers to notice the comprehensive changes that are underway. So our internal projections assume continued sales and earnings pressure and volatility in the business, particularly in the first half of the year.","In light of continuing headwinds, we made thoughtful adjustments to our 2015 plans, pulling back in some areas to fund key growth initiatives focused on delivering greater customer relevance, broader consumer reach, and better restaurant execution. For example, we've reduced capital expenditures by paring back on new store openings in markets that are experiencing significant near-term challenges, including China, Russia, Germany, and the United States. And we're redirecting G&A from the U.S. business incorporates to priority initiatives that will drive our growth. We are committed to taking necessary actions to improve performance and position McDonald's for enduring profitable growth into the future.","As we embarked on a New Year, we maintain high expectations of our sales and for our brand. I remain confident in our prospects, both in the near and long-term. We're keenly focused on the opportunities that exist within our global growth priorities to serve our customers' favorite food and drink, to create memorable experiences, to offer unparalleled convenience, and to become an even more trusted brand.","We're changing, and we're doing it aggressively. We know that some tactics will be different from market-to-market and region-to-region around the world. And that's why our plans are supported by comprehensive and localized execution approaches that rely on our franchisees, our company employees and suppliers to satisfy customer expectations and drive stronger business results.","Thanks again for being on the call everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.","Pete Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hi, everyone. 2014 was a challenging year for McDonald's' all around the world. Our results were impacted on a variety of fronts and across each of our geographic segments.","Today, I'll like to spend a few minutes putting our 2014 performance into perspective, providing details on some key fourth quarter numbers and outlining the critical components of our 2015 financial plan. I'll begin by reviewing our results for the quarter and full year, highlighting the three factors that had a notable impact on performance in each of our major geographic segments.","First, the underperformance of our U.S. business; throughout 2014, our results reflect the impact of ongoing broad-based challenges, including operating in an increasingly competitive marketplace and the sluggish industry growth. For the year, the segment's operating income declined $257 million or 7% partly due to negative comparable sales and guest counts, which contributed to margin decline. U.S. results were also impacted by higher G&A spending and other operating expenses associated with positioning the U.S. business for the future, including the segment's revamped marketing approach and development of the new brand love campaign. We expect to encourage additional U.S. restructuring cost in the first quarter.","The second thing that we can item that affected our global result was the APMEA supplier issue. The total impact from loss sales and expenses associated with our customer recovery efforts was approximately $110 million or $0.09 per share for the quarter and $290 million or $0.23 per share for the full year. The markets most affected by this issue include China, Japan and Hong Kong. Prior to the supplier issue, these markets collectively represented about 10% of global system-wide sale and 5% of global operating income.","In APMEA, our results were also pressured by ongoing performance issues in Japan. With the full year, APMEA's operating income declined 28% or 25% in constant currencies, $430 million. Japan's contribution to APMEA's operating income includes royalties and the company share of McDonald's Japan after tax results.","The third significant impact on McDonald's global results for 2014 was in Russia and the Ukraine. During 2014, McDonald's Europe experienced significant decline in company operating margins driven by weakening currencies and economic slowdown and store closures in these two markets. For the year, Europe reported a $90 million decrease in operating income, a 2% decline in constant currencies with the segment's company-operated margins weighing heavily on results.","The entire operating income declined for the year with solely driven by Russian and the Ukraine company-operated margin results. Over half of this margin decline reflects the significant impact of weakening currencies on imported commodity costs in these two markets. We expect this currency impact to significantly pressure the segment's company-operated margin again in 2015, especially in the first half.","While we expect to move beyond some of these unique events of last year, certain challenges remain. In the U.S., our turnaround initiatives to reignite momentum are in progress. Mike Andres and the U.S. leadership team are implanting a new or nimble organizational structure that places decision-making back in the hands of the local market teams. The U.S. business is working aggressively to implement these changes, but it will take time before we see the benefits in the segment's overall financial results.","In Russia, while all of our restaurants impacted by the temporary closures are back in operation. The market remains in a recession and the economic outlook is weak. More broadly, consumer confidence across most of Europe is forecasted to remain low throughout 2015.","In APMEA, in response to the supplier issue, customer recovery efforts initiated in September in each of our impacted market, while sales trends in China showed signs of improvement during the fourth quarter. Our best estimate is that it will take at least three to six more months for our business in china to return to a normalized level.","For McDonald's Japan, recovery from the supplier issue has not been as strong. At the same time, new consumer perception issues have emerged, which have further depressed sales and profitability. We expect these issues to impact results for the foreseeable future. Japan remains on our priority market list.","Next I want to provide a 2014 update and a 2015 preview for some of our key financial items; commodities, pricing, G&A, and currencies. I'll start with commodity cost for the U.S. and Europe. For the fourth quarter, U.S. commodity cost rose approximately 3.5% primarily due to higher beef prices. For the full year, commodity cost ended up about 3%, which was the upper end of our forecast, as reductions in other commodities were more than offset by increases in beef. Commodity cost pressure is expected to continue into 2015 with the full year increase projected at 1.5% to 2.5%; again, driven primarily by beef.","Excluding currency, Europe's commodity costs were up 1% for the fourth quarter, and were relatively flat for the full year. For 2015, our full year outlook is for Europe's grocery basket to also reflect an increase of 1.5% to 2.5%. To help offset this pressure, we have taken some price increases. The U.S. ended 2014 with pricing abruptly 1.8%, notably lower than the 2013 increase of about 3%, and lower than food away from home inflation, which ended the year at 3%.","During the second half of the year, we consciously did not completely offset the prior year price increases that rolled off. This further pressured our margins during the third and fourth quarter. And based on where we stand at the start of 2015, we expect this pressure to continue in the near-term.","Our price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment, excluding Russia, averaging about 2% year-over-year. Consolidated G&A increased 9% in constant currencies for the fourth quarter, and 5% in constant currencies for the year. For the quarter, these increases were driven largely by cost associated with positioning our U.S. business for the future as well as cost related to our long-term growth initiatives.","As I mentioned in October, during 2014, we identified $100 million of G&A savings in the U.S. incorporates. These savings are being redirected toward our critical long-term growth initiative in 2015. Our review of the corporate G&A spending was completed in December. We're nearing the completion of our full G&A review of the U.S., and we'll provide more details on these efforts later this quarter.","While our G&A increased for both periods in 2014, I want to emphasis an important point. McDonald's operates in a pay-for-performance culture. As such, short-term incentive pay outs for 2014 were zero for all corporate and U.S. employees. In addition, 2014 performance negatively impacted management's long-term incentive compensation.","We expect 2015 G&A to increase 7% to 8% in constant currency primarily due to the restoration of incentive pay. EXCLUDING incremental incentive base compensation 2015 G&A is expected to increase 1% to 2%. More than 100% of this remaining increase relates to costs associated with the expansion of our strategic growth initiatives, including Experience of the Future and our digital strategy.","Foreign currencies proved to be another headwind in 2014 with translation negatively impacting fourth quarter EPS by $0.08, and full year EPS by $0.12. Given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all major foreign currencies, we expect a negative translation in first quarter 2015 of $0.10 per share and a full year impact of $0.35 to $0.40 per share. As usual, take this as directorial guidance only because rates will change as we move throughout the year.","Finally, I'd like to share our current capital expenditure and restaurant opening plans for the upcoming year. Our plan for 2015 capital expenditure budget is approximately $2 billion. Nearly $1 billion left in our initial capital expenditure plan last year. The decrease in our 2013 capital expenditures is driven primarily by an $800 million decrease in capital allocated to new restaurant opening. The most notable reductions will take place in market experiencing the greatest challenges.","China, Russia, Germany, and the U.S., our $2 billion capital budget is divided relatively evenly with approximately 1.5 year mark for new restaurant openings and the remaining $1 billion is dedicated to re investments. We continue to rigorously screen new restaurant opportunities to determine where they will generate the most attractive returns given each markets potential competitive environment and current industry dynamics.","In 2015, we do expect to open more than thousand McDonald's restaurants primarily in China, the U.S., Russia and France. This compares with about 1300 restaurant opening in 2014. On a net basis we expect 600 to 700 additions for the year compare with approximately 800 in 2014. The majority of our reinvestment dollars are slated for the U.S. and the Europe. Expansion of the Create Your Taste burger platforms up to 2000 restaurants in the U.S. continue to rollout. Experience of the Future in Europe accounts for majority of the reinvestment dollars.","Earlier this year, we outlined plans for some additional opportunity to enhance shareholder value by optimizing our capital and ownership structure and scrutinizing our G&A spending. As we close out the first year of our three-year plan, I'd like to update you on our progress. During 2014, we re-franchised over 400 restaurants against our three-year target of at least 1500. In the area of G&A, we identified and redirected nearly 100 million in savings for 2015 for future long-term growth initiatives such as the digital strategy in the McDonald's' experience in the future. As always, we continue to explore additional savings opportunities.","As we move into 2015, we remain on track to deliver against our three year target to return 18 to $20 billion to shareholders between 2014 and 2016 in the form of dividend and share repurchases, having returned $6.4 billion to shareholders last year. We're moving forward aggressively to regain business momentum.","Together; our strategy, strength and structure provide the capability and opportunity for us to change the trajectory of the business and our financial performance. We're on the right path. We've made tough decisions and are holding ourselves to rigorous standards of performance and are doing more with less. As a system, our charge over the coming year is to accelerate the pace of change and elevate the overall McDonald's experience in the eyes of our customers.","Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Chris Stent","Thanks, Pete. I'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] To give as many people as possible the opportunity to ask questions, please limit yourself to one question. We'll come back to you for follow-up questions as time allows. The first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley","Thank you. I'm going to cheat right away and ask two, but that's down from three, so I'm actually complying. A lot of the discussion of plans for the U.S., and it seems more long-term than near-term. The near-term sales results notwithstanding the slight improvement in the month of December have been so weak. I guess I'm curious what the plan is to change the trajectory of sales.","And then the related question I guess is on Create Your Taste, I think when we visited the restaurant with you in your mini-meeting in December that was the sixth restaurant with Create Your Taste, now you're talking about 2000. What is making you accelerate this from a financial standpoint? How confident are you that it works? What are the economics in Create Your Taste, I guess is the basic question?","Don Thompson","Hey, Joe, thanks for the question, questions in this case. Couple of things, what I'll do is I'll respond a little bit to the Create Your Taste piece and then I'm going to ask Mike to speak a little bit to some of those initiatives and actions that are actually in the near-term because I think that was really your question.","Relative to Create Your Taste, please keep this in mind, we have been modeling out looking at Create Your Taste, Build Your Burger now for over three years. We started this in the innovation center. We moved it to a test restaurant in Romeoville. As you know, Joe, when we look at something we look at all aspects of the implementation, from not only the production side and the service side, to crew interactions, to consumer relevance. And so, we've been doing quite a bit in the prior years. Then we've had this in a restaurant in test in the California area, in the SoCal area. We had it in test for about another year plus.","Also keep in mind that we've had similar initiatives in markets outside of the U.S., markets like France on the service side of this, we've been looking at some of the digital application pieces of this in markets like Sweden. So, all of these things have come together into what we today call Create Your Taste. So as we move forward now, this is not about just having had one restaurant, this is about having three plus four-odd years of looking at a concept and various pieces of that concept coming together.","Create Your Taste is not just about the food from a customization and personalization perspective, it's also about the digital engagement and interaction of customers via kiosk or mobile ordering. It's also about a change relative to the interaction with our restaurant employees and how they engage and embrace the customers. It's also about the physical changes within the restaurant as well as how we present our foods, so that you can understand and see the freshness of the produce and the quality of our proteins.","And so this is a much broader piece than simply about the food itself. It is about the overall experience. And so, hopefully that answers that question. I'll ask Mike to speak a little bit about some of the things taking place in the U.S. because there are quite a few relative to the near-term.","Mike Andres","Hi, Joe. As you mentioned, we're looking at our business clearly from a near-term and a longer term perspective. In the near-term, this is a market share game; it's always going to be a market share game. So we trust and we expect to see a more customized approach from our owner operators in terms of owner operator-driven business plan locally, it's based on the customer insights and the unique competitive sets in the marketplace. And these plans are going to be multilayered in nature. You'll see disruptive value. You'll see new product news. You'll see service initiatives. And then our regional management in our new structure is empowered to commit the resources to make these plans come to life.","I don't think we underestimated the power of ownership by owner operators of their own plan to execute on it and get results that we expect to get from those marketplaces. We're also looking at our marketing approach and making sure that we're leveraging the power of the three layers of marketing. Clearly, we've got our local co-ops. We've got our national, and we also have local store marketing. And we're looking at a revamped marketing approach that better coordinates the specific roles and deliverables of our co-op marketing plans using more sophisticated analytics and data to understand the best way to approach.","Certainly, our national messaging comes on top of it to help build our brand. We have unique relationship with our customers and the recent advertising is rekindling that relationship in a way that we've been used to over the years, and we've enjoyed. And then, the local market aspect of it is that it's been our heritage, owner operators at McDonald's being the hub of their local communities, very important to our turnaround plan as well as to local marketing store, things that they're doing to combat the guy across the street from them, that's the key to that.","Then, we're looking at how we address the simplicity, or the complexity, I should say, of our menu. We've simplified our menu as we talked about last month. That's going into place as a matter of fact this week. It includes reduction in the EVMs, other menu items; our test market results which included faster order times and faster total times in the drive-through continue to see performance above the controls. So no single initiative is going to drive improvements, but it's all these working together and things that will create a differentiated customer experience that our customers will notice. So we're looking at the U.S., there's 22 different regions, as you know there is multiple markets within those regions. We're already seeing pockets of success and expect those pockets of success to grow. And then, parallel to this short-term we're looking at a longer term, refining our plans to make comprehensive changes that create an enhanced experience for the customers and continue to differentiate McDonald's from the other QSRs.","So, Don talked about CYT; you asked about it, that is only one element of this refined experience. It is comprehensive in nature. We are calling it the Experience of The Future, we're co-creating this with our owner operators, and we'll present the plan to all of our owner operators at a National Meeting in March. And right after that, we'll start aggressively expanding that up to 2000 stores in 2015.","Chris Stent","Okay. Next question is from Karen Holthouse of Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse","Hi, thank you for taking the question. So we've seen pretty meaningful pressure on margins in the fourth quarter this year and even if the commodity outlook into '15 is fairly muted, we are starting to see sort of on a more macro level, some signs of QSR wages re-inflating. Is that something you're also seeing in your system and assuming that is a factor in 2015 how should we think about company's philosophy of accepting that pressure versus passing it on and then on the franchise side really their ability to accept that pressure versus need to pass it on?","Pete Bensen","Hey, Karen, it's Pete. As we've talked a lot over these last couple of years, margins are such a top line game for us. So, very critical in the margin area that the plans and initiatives that Mike talked about, especially in the U.S. start to gain momentum and get that traction back on the top line.","Having said that, we are in a relatively low inflation environment, so pricing as I noted in my commentary, pricing will still be probably below our average if you assume the low inflationary environment continues. At the same time, multiple states are increasing minimum wages. We've got National Healthcare impacting 2015 for the first time. That's going to hit the McOpCo margin for about 20 basis points.","So I think the margin in the U.S. will continue to be a little bit pressured by the combination of less price flexibility and few of these costs, but long-term as the sales get back on track and start to grow, that is what will allow us to start to see the margin leverage. And the same dynamics are impacting franchisees restaurants as well. As they start to grow guest counts and cash flow, they will start to offset some of these pressures.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about Europe; my greatest area of curiosity lies with really the heart of Europe, France has been getting softer in recent months, at least I believe so. Germany has been soft for a while. It doesn't look like in those markets you're playing your B game. You've done a lot of good things there. Are consumer perceptions of McDonald's in fast food changing in Europe or is this purely an economic issue and what are the steps you're taking to restore growth? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question, David. There are some positives and then there are some challengers relative to our business in Europe. Some of the positives are in 2015 we'll see -- if you look globally around the system first, you'll see some good high-yield growth. There are some parts of the Europe where we will see a little bit of high-yield growth, i.e., Germany we will see a bit projected in '15 and in U.K. we will see a bit.","France is a more difficult market. France is actually projected to have some high-yield decline. We have been gaining our market share in both France and the U.K. despite some of the difficult broader business or macro environments. Germany, we've lost some share, and we talked about Germany as a priority market. What I will tell you is that as a priority market there were a number of changes that Germany has implemented. Some of those I spoke to relative to the actual team that we have there, our marketing leadership there; actually our agency, we changed out the agency in Germany. We're seeing a collaboration with the franchisees that is much stronger. So we're making some positive moves in our marketing plans, our menu plans. And we're seeing some changes relative to how we're addressing the consumers in those markets.","So I'm feeling as -- I mentioned Germany had a -- it seems to be we're seeing some recovery in Germany. We're cautious as we say it, because there are some challenges across Europe as we all know right now relative to the Euro itself. But we are seeing some positive things there. But I would tell you it's broadly economic in many of the markets with the exception of Germany where we have some things to do in terms of our own internal plans, but for many of the other markets we're gaining share or we're at a point where our businesses are continuing to compete on par with our competition there. So it will be primarily an economic piece relative to Europe.","Chris Stent","Next question; Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","Thanks. Just following up on an earlier question, what level of same-store sales growth do you guys need in both the U.S. and Europe segments to hold on to restaurant level margins in '15? And you touched on it, but do you have any opportunities in the shorter term to control some of your potential cost on -- you mentioned labor, but some of the other cost on the restaurant level line?","Pete Bensen","Jeff, historically we've talked about a 2% to 3% -- I'm sorry, 2% to 3% comp needed to maintain margins in the U.S., and again that's been modeled in what we called a normal year. So when you have normal commodity inflation, normal price elasticity and ability to raise prices normal wage inflation et cetera. So a lot of those variables are a little bit out of whack for 2015. So the prices I already addressed we don't see getting to our historical levels. Wages will probably grow a little faster than normal, especially if you throw in the healthcare impact of that. So again as we think about it, especially in this first half of the year U.S. margin will continue to be a little bit under pressure.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, Pete, around financial strategies; and I guess first as you get into the re-franchising program that you mentioned, are you finding opportunities to potentially go deeper and I guess the big picture question is could you take the system to a much higher franchise percentage overtime, say into the 90s or even approaching a 100% of that even practical or are you thinking about it differently. And then maybe a second part of the financial question would be, are there ways to go deeper on some of the G&A cuts. I know you're reallocating a $100 million but are there other opportunities that you're seeing that might be able to sort of limit the increases that you'll see this year and into next year.","Pete Bensen","Thanks, David. First, on the re-franchising, we started out with our guidance we said at least 1500 restaurants. And we feel comfortable in being able to accomplish that over the next three years. I'll tell you the dialog with the area-of-the-world Presidents has increased around the re-franchising and the benefit that, that can bring to the overall business. So we're not committing to a new target by any means but we also said that after that three year period franchising will continue to be something that we look at and go after. So a 100% we will never be but certainly the ability to continue to increase that franchise percentage overtime is something that we will look at.","Yes. On the G&A side, I think we've been fairly consistent since we announced our plans for the savings that we believe there are significant growth opportunities available in this McDonald's Experience of The Future. And in fact since we first started talking about it, we've gotten a little bit more aggressive in our plans to go after that in 2015. So, for the short-term you heard us say we don't think we can cut our way to growth in the G&A area and we recognized these are fairly amount of resources we are reinvesting, but we believe that it's right for the long-term benefit of the business as Mike said to, we kind of change the customer experience in the McDonald's restaurants, and as we think about reallocating kind of growth resources by cutting over 800 million of capital allocated to new restaurant openings and redirecting it towards the McDonald's Experience of The Future, we think that's an appropriate and prudent thing to do in this environment.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","Don Thompson","John, you there?","John Glass","Yes. Can you hear me okay?","Pete Bensen","Yes. We can hear you now.","John Glass","Okay, thanks. Could you just clarify if the reduction in CapEx is a one-year reduction or you view this as the new run rate, and what happens to this windfall, is it upside to $18 billion to $20 million return, or you're just making up for the shortfall in the cash flow of the business in the last year or so? And then Mike, can you just talk about the pricing; I think you said in menu item reductions where are you in that process, is it hurting sales, have you find it actually as sales neutral, the same thing for the pricing adjustment, I think you talked about maybe lowering or adjusting prices, is it possible to actually see menu pricing going negative as a result of that?","Pete Bensen","All right, John. I will take the first half and Mike will take the second half. So the cut down to 2 billion, that's not a formative run rate. I mean in these markets that we described, you heard us talk about the growth opportunities that exist in these markets is a, I'd call it a relatively shorter term re-adjustment as we face the realities of the business environment we are operating in. And so, think about it as this is 2015 only and as we move throughout the year and regain that momentum that Don talked about, we'll start to realize where the capital will go in 2015, but keeping that balance between investing in the Experience of the Future and the appropriate level of new restaurant openings, and think about all of this in our $18 billion to $20 billion target.","Don Thompson","John, one of the things, and I know there has been a couple of questions around this. We firmly believe based upon the strength of our business and the reach of our business, as you all know we touch about 70 million customers a day. One of the things that we've not leveraged strongly has been the whole digital engagement aspect. So as we embarked upon the digital strategy, we knew we were embarking upon something that was going to require us to make substantial investments to get it up to par, to be able to have mobile ordering and mobile payment to be able to have promotional offerings that really, really were relevant to customers today across all age ranges. And so, we've made substantial investments there.","Our focus now is to focus on that in-restaurant experience of our existing base. So we can improve upon on this, whether that's digital engagement, the physical assets themselves, the way the restaurants look, the placement of kiosk in the restaurants, our food offerings in the restaurants, that is where we're making substantial investments. This is not that much different. When we decided that we were going to focus on McCaf\u00e9 at one point, pull back some of the new store capital at that time and reinvested it back in existing restaurants. And so, we are doing something very similar as we look at the digital strategy, the in-restaurant experience, and the Create Your Taste and food experiences in the restaurant. And so, as we look at this we will continue to look at our expenditures both internally and externally, but we will also be mindful where we have opportunities in some of the markets to grow as those markets return to the level of growth and the level of, I'd say, stability that we think is going to be needed for us to be able to continue on new development strategies in some of those markets.","Mike, if you would, a little bit on the menu.","Mike Andres","Yes. So, John, the menu rationalization that is being rolled out as we speak, we are expecting to see the same results that we saw in the test markets which included, obviously it would be a throughput improvement because we're making it easier to order for our customers, plus complexity in the kitchen so the time to get that out the kitchen and through the windows increases. So we're seeing an improved sales result against the control markets and our test to expect to see that happen in the rest of the country.","I did not speak specifically about pricing but did speak about value and that the markets are clearly more targeted in terms of the efforts around value and competitive threats within the marketplaces. So we're seeing more aggressive disruptive value offers in the marketplaces. As a matter of fact we are moving to a strategy of more flexibility for the local markets to price dollar menu and more which is complementing their other value messages so the level of aggressive and the tactics can be more reflective of the customer expectations, the specific competitor activity and the economic realities of niche market.","Chris Stent","Next question; Keith Siegner of the UBS.","Keith Siegner","Thanks, and I want to ask a question about Japan and I realize that it's a relatively small percentage of the overall operating profits but it's having a material impact on results and we've talked about the strategic rationale for this in the past and Pete what you told us is keeping that ownership percentage was important because it let you influence that business and help to improve it. We've had years of negative same-store sales including unit closures. You just mentioned that you expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Is the plan in -- or do we, since you're there to help influence it do we need like a wholesale restating of the brand at this point? Where do we go with Japan? Thanks.","Pete Bensen","Keith, I think that's a fair question. If you think of us the unforeseen event over the last let's say six months, it's had a significant impact on the consumer perception of the brand in Japan and frankly there were some concerns about the consumer perception of the brand before these incidents and so to your point I think there is an opportunity here and talking with the APMEA leadership and the Japan leadership the recognition that there's kind of a clean sheet of paper approach to take a look at what we're doing with our brand positioning there and how we connect with the consumer so we can improve the trends in our business there overtime.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Will Slabaugh","Yeah, thanks guys, I wondered if you can talk a little bit more about the simplification of the menu and I know you've mentioned that it's happening right now, wondered if you could talk about how much further you'd be willing to go assuming you do see some improvement here and if you think there will be much more room to take more off of the menu? And then if you can sort of contrast that with any potential new menu items that you may introduce and where they may fall in terms of premium versus value?","Mike Andres","Thanks, Will. I think this menu rationalization process is clearly ongoing as we look forward we had a quite a number of products over the last 18 months or so. So we're rationalizing that looking at clearly what the customers are ordering what they expect to see. I think moving forward, one of the things that we're seeing with Create your Taste obviously that offers unlimited variety to our guest they can use whatever they like, so it takes some of the pressure off of lot of the other menu items that we would have on showing on the menu at any given time.","In terms of the overall menu pipeline and what we're looking at today, obviously food is a high priority for me personally. I think that's the foundation of where we're taking the business looking forward and what the expectations of the consumer are. So we're seeing this localization of what more locally relevant products that are being drawn or pulled from the marketplace as they get into the customer insights. We're looking at building our culinary talent to support our talented U.S. chefs. We're including our supplier team of chefs. We got some outside consultants who will bring a fresh and forward thinking perspective on our menu vision.","We've got looking at educating America on our food, so this conversation about Our Food, Your Question, giving them facts. We've seen 20 million hits on YouTube, 4.1 billion on Media Impression, so that's resonating with our consumers and it's about the quality story. We have to make sure that our quality aligns with the consumers' definition of quality moving forward. So we're going to be very aggressive in that area looking at -- we're working with our own operators to revise our product vision for a very different future, as led by the consumer from the provenance to the label ingredients, to the processes we use to bring the food from farm to table. We've opportunities to clean up our ingredient list and enhance the taste.","And as you mentioned, a lot of innovation going on, including Create Your Taste, we're evolving on menu in response to a lot of the consumer trends. We are launching new products at a national level this year, and we're complementing that on differentiated products at a local level. That's a mission allowing the marketplaces to address the specific and the regional taste that exists out there today, so, a lot of new products news to see in the coming year, and news on our food, in general.","Chris Stent","Next question; Matt DiFrisco of Buckingham Research.","Q \u2013 Katherine Heng","Hi, this is Katherine for Matt. Can you talk about your comparable GAAP between your December same-store sales to the QSR; overall QSR sandwich category? And also the second part of the question is regarding your Create Your Taste. Can you comment on this any incremental traffic that you're seeing with the customization? Is it adding another level of complexity to the operations; any effect on the speed of service. Thank you.","Mike Andres","Regarding the comp GAAP, clearly, that is an important metric for us to follow and certainly with high awareness of that in our market places today. So we're seeing that -- we're confronted with some inflationary pressures at the \u2013 they're well-documented. And I think we kind of lost our focus on the customer relative the values are the comp competition became more aggressive. So we're seeing that gap start to improve the less negative of course that gap varies by market place. We have markets that actually have a positive comp GAAP. So obviously we're learning from the things that are happening in those markets. But as I mentioned our plans and our tactics in each market, they've got multiple layers, which include proactive and reactive targeted tactics against specific competitor activity.","Pete Bensen","Specifically that the GAAP for December was 4.1, negative 4.1.","Don Thompson","Relative to Create Your Taste, clearly, we're seeing positive results. We have Australia at a point that, by year end they will implement nearly 900 restaurants on the platform. And again it's a much more integrated platform. It encompasses service, it encompasses multiple order points so the kiosk applications, mobile applications those things as well as being able still approach the business in a traditional sense from through the front counter or through drive-through.","We are looking at all aspects of how we bring this new food offering and customer choice and customization to all the customers who want to experience McDonald's. So we're seeing some positives in the market, clearly otherwise we would not be implementing this. I'd tell you that from a service perspective no matter what you implement throughout the years in the McDonald's system initially what you're going to see is a slight service increase or decrease, I would say, in terms of the effectiveness of us being able to serve any initial month or two. And then that should come right back and we should be able to be even more efficient. That is the same thing that we're seeing with Create Your Taste thus far. So thus far we're very positive on create your taste. But we're also mindful that we need to do this the right way. So we're not rushing to try to implement to the U.S. over one or two year period.","We're looking at the application to make sure that they give the impact that we want from a guest count, a sale and an average check perspective, which is also a huge aspect, as well as the halo around the freshness of our food and all of our problems. So, we're excited about what we see thus far. But we're also cautious about how we continue to implement this across the year.","Chris Stent","All right. Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","Q \u2013 Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. Two follow ups; the first is on Create Your Taste and what you're seeing in Australia. I think one of the differences is certainly for example, is France, we have had some nice success with some of these initiatives. Is that the dine-in traffic or the dine-in is a much stronger portion in the U.S. So I guess the first question is are these kinds of initiatives last relevant in the U.S. because just to mix of your business so much they goes to the drive-through or even carryout.","And then, the second question I wanted to ask is a follow-up on the -- you're trying about improving the quality halo and the providence. When I look at the competitive set, you know what I'd call traditional QSRs, there are some that are doing quite well without any of that \u2013- with I think just sort of a core competency around speed and service. Mike, be you could talk about diagnosing that while some of your very direct competitors seems to be doing well even in the absence of fitting in with some of these trends about quality and provenance and the sort of the fast casual direction. Thanks.","Don Thompson","Okay, I'll take both parts. On the first part, relative to Create Your Taste in different dynamics or better experience of the future in difference dynamics because what France is doing is not an implementation of Create Your Taste at this point. They have implemented multiple order points and now you can place an order through the kiosk, front counter, table counter, web ordering etcetera, mobile ordering. And when you look at the table service in France, yes, there is a strongest queue to end store versus drive-through.","However, I will tell you this, what we do is look at things like that and we will tailor those based upon the markets that we're implementing it. We already know that in the U.S. with the restaurant today implementing Create Your Taste that we're seeing very positive results. Therefore what we're doing is pulling customers who have a little bit more time and want experience the restaurant inside to come inside the restaurant. We make tremendous investments in terms of re-imaging and actually we have more customers that are seeing those investments in this environment and would be offering a Create Your Taste.","So they will be modeled for the various markets around the world based upon what is going to appeal the customer the most. France will not be implementing Create Your Taste that the same taste, to say, Australia has. Australia is at a different point with regard to -- say we're bordering them. France has been. We'll take -- We will learn from all of those things as we bring this forward. But nonetheless Create Your Taste; table service in France, kiosk applications across Europe, all of those things have been successful for and really the experience of the future aspect holds them all together. And so you know the season variations across the market. But clearly, we'll look at the performance metrics to make sure we move forward effectively.","This is not unlike, again, McCaf\u00e9 was very different in Australia than it is in the U.S., yet and still McCaf\u00e9 has worked in both. On the other side, relative to traditional QSR's, I'd offer this; no one is really shining that brightly relative to the traditional QSR space. I think what we're talking about at McDonald's is appealing more to the consumers that are out there, that are high-yield customers. So it's not about a QSR thing or fast casual thing. It's about this taste in food. It's about affordability. It is about transparency as a brand. It's about a great service experience that gives them a choice. Those are the things that we're putting in place. Those are the things that will help us prepare all those business and moving forward.","So we're not gauging ourself by other QSR's as you were. We're gauging ourselves by the market opportunity and we want to do that. I would also tell you that as we look forward at the markets around the world, each of those markets that we said today, is very different and at different places. So they will be able to bring the experience of the future to light in their market relative to their customer basis. But we're not skipping over the existing execution of the core products that we have, the core menu that we have, core service expectation, quality, service, cleanliness, those things are important in every single market we have around the world today.","Chris Stent","We're out of time. So I'll turn it over to Don, who has a few closing comments.","Don Thompson","Let me just make a couple of comments because they came up a couple of times about our franchisee and thoughts about -- someone mentioned something relative to implementation of franchisees and they thought about it. I have to tell you in the last couple of years as we've said have been difficult, but as a global system, all of our system has experienced quite a bit and endured many unforeseen changes in the local market. But at the same time, we've charted and began to implement a stronger pathway for future growth.","I couldn't be more proud of the franchisees we have around the world. They own and operate 81% of our restaurants, and without them we would not have been able to endure those things which we have over the last couple of years. Well, there was geopolitical issues, some food-related issues, our franchisees along with the employees and suppliers have done a tremendous job, and it's that strength that is going to propel us forward, if that unmentioned strength if you would, we don't often talk about when we talk about the financials, but it's one of the things that made McDonald's special and it is one of the things that will fuel our growth as we move forward.","I want to thank all of you for joining us on the call today. 2015, as we say, will be a year of regaining momentum. We're making progress as we move even closer to our customers and as we change to be relevant and more progressive, modern service, genuine hospitality, personal engagement, more relevant customized menus, and a brand that people can trust, truly trust, this is the McDonald's Experience of the Future. It is the path that we are forging, and I would tell you that the future is already on its way. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages and strips of our system are truly a reflection of our ability to learn from our past, but to also be purposeful and agile in the present and to strategically plan and evolve with changing customers perceptions, attitudes, and desires as we move into the future.","Thank all of you for attending and participating on the call today, and have a great day."],"13885":["McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 30, 2019 11:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Mike Cieplak - Investor Relations Officer","Steve Easterbrook - President and CEO","Kevin Ozan - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Eric Gonzalez - KeyBanc","Andrew Charles - Cowen","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Matt DiFrisco - Guggenheim","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","David Tarantino - Baird","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Jake Bartlett - SunTrust","Greg Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Operator","Hello, and welcome to McDonald's First Quarter 2019 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.","Mike Cieplak","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call this m morning are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and is also being recorded for replay on our website.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now I'll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","We're off to a strong start for 2019. Our broad-based momentum around the world continues as we further execute on our Velocity Growth Plan. Global comparable sales increased 5.4%. That's over $1 billion of growth across the system for the quarter. This marks our 15th consecutive quarter of positive global comp sales despite some of the continuing macroeconomic uncertainties around the world.","We also grew global guest counts for the quarter. In the U.S. we are pleased with our performance to start the year. The market continues to execute against the most ambitious plan in our history. And whilst we recognize we have a lot of hard work ahead of us we are encouraged with our progress and improved franchisee cash flow to start the year.","Our customer satisfaction scores are improving as more guests are able to enjoy McDonald's in our modernized Experience of the Future restaurants. For the first time since we've begun our EOTF rollout we are seeing a benefits to our overall U. S. sales comp. Where 2018 focused on considerable transformation and building a foundation for growth our 2019 focus is on operation execution in our restaurants and optimizing the experience for our customers.","For example the UK. has now achieved a remarkable 13 consecutive years of comparable sales growth. The market's focus on value menu innovation and McDelivery is resulting in balanced growth in both average check and guest counts including record high guest counts for the month of March. We're also seeing strong performance in Australia.","I visited Sydney and Melbourne last month and continue to be impressed with how the team is successfully driving growth across all dayparts. The market has now grown comparable sales for the past 20 consecutive quarters.","With strong leadership and franchisee alignment the market's excelling at the fundamentals of running great restaurants growing their delivery business and leveraging the investments we've made in digital. Our customers in Australia are also taking notice of the effort we are putting into delivering delicious feel-good moments.","Today more customers are using our global mobile app and McDelivery to order delicious McDonald's food on their terms. And an increasing number of customers are choosing to use our self-order kiosks to place their orders. The Australia team has more than doubled McDelivery awareness through our strong partnership with Uber Eats.","And with our barista trained crew executing at a high-level both in restaurants and in the drive-thru coffee has become the most frequently ordered item on our McDonald's app. The Progress we are seeing in the US, UK and Australia demonstrates how our Velocity Growth plan is working and enabling us to deliver broad-based growth across our segments.","With that I'll turn it over to Kevin to share more about our top line performance.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Steve. With global comp sales up 5.4% for the quarter each of our operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. As a reminder in January we evolved our organizational structure to support our more heavily franchised business model enabling even more sharing and scaling of best practices and innovations across markets.","Not only does our new structure provide operational benefits it also increases visibility into the contributions made to our overall business by both our wholly owned markets and our Developmental Licensee markets. First quarter for the U.S. was strong with comparable sales growth of 4.5% and all dayparts contributing to the growth.","While comp guest counts were negative for the quarter the U.S. continues to experience strong average check growth driven by balanced contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing. Consumer relevant national promotions such as the bacon event and the two for $5 Mix and Match deal which included our fresh beef quarter pounders for the first time performed well in the quarter.","We also introduced Donut Sticks at the Breakfast daypart and this new item resonated with our customers. Throughout 2019 we'll continue to pulse in national deals like the two for $5 Mix and Match that was re-launched yesterday.","These deals will complement local value at both breakfast and on the $1 $2 $3 Dollar Menu as individual co-ops decide which menu items resonate best with their customers. As we continue on our EOTF journey in the US and as Steve mentioned earlier we are now seeing an overall net positive contribution to comp sales from our aggressive modernization efforts.","This means that the sales lifts from completed projects now exceed the downtime impact from current projects under construction. During the quarter we converted an additional 400 restaurants to EOTF.","We have now completed over 8,000 EOTF restaurants or about 60% of our estate in the US. We still expect to complete approximately 2,000 projects this year. Turning to the International Operated segment. Comp sales were up 6%.","The largest contributors in the segment were our big five international markets: Australia Canada France Germany and the UK with the UK and France leading the way. France experienced its highest comp sales increase since 2011 along with its highest ever market share.","The market is successfully optimizing products such as the Big Tasty and Big Mac bacon along with new promotional offerings. And last month France also began serving our iconic Egg McMuffin all day.","Finally comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were also up 6% for the quarter with each geographic region in the segment growing both comp sales and guest counts. China continues to be a competitive market. Late in the quarter we introduced a new everyday value offering which complements our Extra Value Meal launch in late 2018.","We also opened more than 90 new restaurants in the quarter in China driving growth in systemwide sales and a gain in market share and we're well on our way to opening about 400 restaurants for the year.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve to expand on the accelerators which are enabling our global growth.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks Kevin. Since the launch of the Velocity Growth Plan we've been increasingly focused on using technology to make our customers experience easier and more convenient when they visit our restaurants. From our global mobile app to our self-order kiosks to our digital menu boards we've established our digital foundation.","We've created an ecosystem that more and more of our customers are using to order pay and receive the delicious McDonald's food on their terms. Now we're building on that foundation with our recent acquisition of Dynamic Yield a leader in personalization and decision logic technology.","Dynamic Yield's technology varies suggested offers by time of day weather and trending menu items. Over time using data from the millions of customers that we serve daily the technology will get smarter and smarter through machine learning.","And using the data collected based on current restaurant traffic at the drive-thru the technology will begin to suggest items that can make peak times easier on our restaurant operations and crew. We've already begun our rollout and now have the technology up and running in 700 drive-thrus across the U. S. Long term this technology will work across all of our digital platforms including our self-order kiosks and our global mobile approximately.","When our technology ecosystem is linked it will provide a seamless ordering experience for our customers and we'll leverage our size and scale to take advantage of being one of the first brick-and-mortar companies to integrate decision logic into the customer ordering process.","By acquiring Dynamic Yield we also have access to strong data science and engineering talent who will help us stay ahead of the curve when it comes to connecting with our customers in more personalized ways. This acquisition is just one tangible demonstration of the steps we're taking to leverage industry-leading innovative technology to accelerate our growth and offer our customers and even easier more enjoyable experience.","In addition to using technology to create seamless experiences we're also maintaining our focus on improving the fundamentals of running great restaurants. For example drive-thru remains a popular way for many of our customers to order their Big Macs Chicken McNuggets french fries and more.","That's why we've never been more focused on improving the experience of the drive-thru. In particular the speed of service. Many of the improvements we're exploring at scale are taken from best practices we've seen in markets around the world. In Italy having a disciplined daily focus on running great restaurants has helped the market deliver some of the strongest sales performance in its history.","As part of their overall effort to strengthen operations they identified an opportunity to improve speed of service by running multiple drive-thru competitions in the restaurants. With our crew fully engaged they were able to make meaningful reductions in drive-thru service times and customers are noticing.","Our customer satisfaction scores have increased across all categories from speed of service to friendliness to accuracy. And in the U.S. our restaurants participated in an incentive program where they competed against each other to deliver the best drive-thru service times in a fun and engaging way.","We introduced the competition in the middle of Q1 and it made a difference with lower service times whilst improving guest counts in many of our restaurants. I'd like to personally congratulate our Boise Twin Falls Idaho Falls co-op for winning our first quarter drive-thru challenge.","But more importantly for serving our guests faster at the critical breakfast daypart. As of our customers' expectations for service keep evolving we'll continue to share our best learnings like these across the globe.","The work we're doing to improve drive-thru service times is only one way we are ensuring we run great restaurants. We're also are finding new ways to create more excitement around our customers favorite core menu items by using existing ingredients which ensures we do not add complexity for our restaurant operations and crew.","For example after a successful limited time offering of Big Mac Bacon Burgers in Canada we launched campaigns to connect with consumers love for bacon during the quarter with similar offerings in the UK France and Russia.","And in the U. S. we entice customers to add bacon not only to their Big Macs but also to our fresh beef quarter pounders. The US market even stole shamelessly from our friends in Australia by introducing cheesy bacon fries.","This kind of smart menu innovation is a great example of how we're able to surprise and delight our customers whilst balancing their demands for speed of service with the complexity of operating at the scale of McDonald's.","We are pleased with the enhancements we're making to the experience guests have when they visit our restaurants but we also know how important it is continue meeting our customers increasing demands for convenience especially through delivery. Delivery remains a key part of our Velocity Growth Plan.","It has been one of our most successful accelerators from the start likely due to the speed at which we began to implement it and because we began scaling our delivery offering at a time when customers are eating out less. Delivery has grown to a $3 billion business for both McDonald's company and franchise restaurants globally and we believe there's a lot more opportunity to grow.","We now offer McDelivery in over 20,000 restaurants across more than 75 countries which is more than half of all McDonald's restaurants globally. Our ability to continue expanding our delivery reach further demonstrates how our size scale and convenient locations close to customers gives us a tremendous advantage.","We're seeing solid growth in delivery and it continues to be a meaningful contributor to comp sales in a number of markets. Awareness remains one of our greatest opportunities with delivery so we're committed to making sure more and more customers are aware of McDelivery and the opportunity that exists for them to enjoy McDonald's wherever they are.","Now I'll turn it over to Kevin for our financial highlights of the quarter.","Kevin Ozan","Earnings per share was $1.72 for the quarter a 5% increase in constant currencies. Our results benefited from strong operating performance despite lapping higher gains on sales of restaurants due to our heavier refranchising activity in first quarter 2018.","While we still have some ongoing refranchising of restaurants our major refranchising efforts are winding down. We grew revenue 2% in constant currencies for the quarter marking our first quarter of growth since our refranchising strategy began in earnest in 2016.","Given our strong comp sales performance overall margin dollars increased in all segments and grew more than $100 million in constant currencies on a consolidated basis.","This contributed to our operating margin for the quarter of 42.3% reflecting growth of 60 basis points versus last year. Our franchise margin dollars grew 7% in constant currencies. Due to a change in presentation of sublease income and expense within franchise margins as a result of the new lease accounting standard our franchise margin percent was negatively impacted 70 basis points.","To be clear there is no impact to our franchise margin dollars as a result of the new standard but this reset of the franchise margin percent will be ongoing. Our overall franchise margin percent declined 120 basis points due to this accounting change as well as depreciation expense related to EOTF in the U.S. Turning to our company-operated restaurants.","Consolidated margins declined 20 basis points to 15.8% for the quarter. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 40 basis points as our strong sales performance more than offset higher labor and occupancy costs. US company-operated margins were challenged due to continuing labor pressures along with higher commodity costs and EOTF-related depreciation. In the U.S. first quarter pricing was up about 2% while commodity costs for the quarter increased approximately 3%.","While we expect commodity pressures to ease somewhat throughout the year we now anticipate our U.S. grocery basket will be up 2% to 3% for the full year. Across the big five markets in the IOM segment menu prices averaged about 2% higher and commodity costs were up about 1.5% for the quarter. We still expect commodities to be up about 2% for the full year.","G&A for the quarter was down 4% in constant currencies at 2.1% of systemwide sales. Steve talked earlier about the strategic purchase of Dynamic Yield to advance our digital capabilities. As a result of this acquisition along with some R&D investments in other areas of technology we now expect full year G&A spend to be relatively flat in constant currencies versus last year.","Our effective tax rate was 27.5% for the quarter as we finalized the application of new regulations issued in the first quarter related to U.S. tax reform. We still expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Foreign currency translation hurt our first quarter results by $0.09 per share.","At current exchange rates we expect the impact of foreign currency to be slightly less for Q2 and then ease in the back half of the year with an estimated full year headwind of $0.18 to $0.20. As usual this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","In addition to our intense focus on driving performance as one of the world's largest restaurant companies and most recognizable brands we know we have the responsibility and opportunity to take action on some of the most pressing social and environmental challenges in the world today.","Last year we announced priorities where we felt we could use our scale for good to make the biggest difference in areas that intersect directly with our business operations.","These areas include climate action sustainable beef packaging and recycling our commitment to families and youth opportunity. We've continued to make progress in these areas and other parts of our food supply chain by collaborating with millions of customers employees franchisees suppliers and other partners.","For example prior to our Scale for Good campaign we set a bold target to source 100% cage-free eggs by 2025 in the U.S. Now just 3.5 years into the 10-year plan we're proud to announce that the U.S. is already one-third of the way toward fulfilling our goal. This means that over 725 million cage-free eggs will be served in our U.S. restaurants in 2019.","And many of our other global markets are also in the process of transitioning to cage-free eggs. In addition to using our scale for good we're continuing to make a broader set of investments in people across the entire McDonald's System. Together with our franchisees we provide jobs for almost 2 million people across the world and are one of the world's largest employers of women.","Whilst women have strong representation in leadership positions throughout our organization and in the U. S. make up 60% of all restaurants managers. We're committed to making even more progress.","That's why by 2023 we will improve the representation of women at all levels of the company achieve gender equality in career advancements and champion the impacts of women on the business.","We recently announced this commitment on International Women's Day as we launched Better Together a sweeping initiative to improve gender balance and diversity. As part of this we'll put training and systems in place to enhance equality in career advancement for women.","And we'll be encouraging our franchisees and suppliers worldwide to deliver strategies that promote gender balance and diversity. Just before I wrap up my prepared remarks I did want to take a moment to acknowledge the passing of someone who played a pivotal role in McDonald's.","Last week Jeff Stratton former President of McDonald's USA passed away. Jeff was with McDonald's for over 40 years and in that time, also ran our global restaurant Solutions Group, our Innovation center and at one-time our food improvement teams around the world.","He had an unwavering passion for running great restaurants and there was no greater brand ambassador than him. Jeff truly made us better. We always say that McDonald's is an organization built on people and Jeff's contribution at McDonald's will always be remembered.","As I close despite any uncertainties we have one of the world's most iconic brands we're leveraging technology to improve and modernize the way we connect with our customers we have a dynamic menu of delicious affordable food offerings our customers value and enjoy.","We have great suppliers who partner with us to deliver at the scale of McDonald's. We have the most dedicated franchisees who are committed to running great restaurants. And we have the world's best and hardest working crews striving every day to delight our customers. When we bring all these elements together we are confident about the road ahead and we are well positioned to win for the long term.","And now we'll open it up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.","Eric Gonzalez","Hey, thanks for taking my question. My question is related to traffic trends in the US. I was wondering how U.S. traffic trended through the quarter and specifically to what extent the peed of service competition introduced mid quarter helped improve the traffic trajectory? And is the benefit from drive-thru competition sustainable? Or does it fall off when the incentive goes away? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Yeah. Eric I'll start with traffic. So we said traffic was negative in the U.S. I guess I'd say it's in line with kind of where it's been the last few quarters. No significant change in trend as far as the overall traffic number. And I'll Steve do you want to talk about the competitions in the drive-thru?","Steve Easterbrook","Yeah. Absolutely. I think, just further context around why we're focusing on this. As you can imagine the last probably 12 to 18 months the majority of the focus has been on the in-restaurant dining experience we were rapidly rolling out Experience of the Future.","We're focusing on kitchen procedures as we roll out fresh beef quarter pounders for example. And we just thought this was the right time given a lot of that disruptive activity we've worked our way through that now. We can get back to the basics of focusing on running better restaurants.","So we decided to kick off with a focus on drive-thru during the peak hours of breakfast which was clearly an opportunity for us. And yeah, we managed to reduce service times which is really encouraging. It was a later start in the quarter. But certainly the enthusiasm in the kind of co-op to co-op competitions was great.","So we're going to continue with a series of these throughout this year. And certainly having been in the field I was in Miami and Fort Myers towards the end of the quarter I was in Atlanta and Baton Rouge Indiana at the start of the quarter certainly the conversation amongst our field leadership and owner\/operators is they're excited about having a clean run at 2019 because we really can just focus the managers the crew and all of our attention on just the fundamentals of running great restaurants.","So encouraged by the start, want to see some drive-thru service time decreases. We did see decreases in service time in the U.S. in the quarter. And it's not just the U.S. by the way. This is a global focus that we had a start of year meeting will all of the managing directors of our major markets.","And we're seeing some remarkable results in countries like Germany Italy Poland Spain anywhere between 20 and 40 seconds taken off the drive-thru service times literally just within that quarter. So I just really I guess just want to express there is organizational enthusiasm around this and it's great that we get into these sorts of conversations with each other because this is what we enjoy and this is what we are good at but we want to get better at.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thank you. I have two separate questions. Steve it's been clear very clear since the February franchisee leadership Council election there's better alignment in the US system between you and the operators and that's definitely evidenced in part by 1Q's improvement in sales. After the EOTF CapEx contribution of 55% was extended in November by one year from 2019 to 2020 how sacrosanct is keeping that 2020 deadline for the elevated CapEx contribution to help build on the momentum of improved relations?","And then, Kevin a separate question for you. You previously guided that the EOTF benefit to comps was more likely to be a second half 2019 benefit. Kudos obviously for the benefit in 1Q. But could you talk about why the first quarter did in fact benefit from net remodels beyond conservatism in the guidance?","And if you could also quantify the 1Q contribution for the EOTF that would be helpful as well? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","Okay, Andrew, I'll take the first couple of those questions because I think there was a third and a fourth one. But Owner\/Operator sentiment it's been a really constructive quarter. I mean again just to provide the context I often say there are four differentiating advantages that McDonald's has already over anyone else in our sector.","Geographic spread I think is one of those which makes it incredibly resilient. Just The iconic brands is a differentiator for us. Our financial strength both at a restaurant level organizational level as well. And the fourth is our Owner\/operators.","And just having constructive relations with the owner\/operators and our market leadership always puts us in a stronger position. So with the newly elected leadership of the National Franchisee Leadership Alliance there's been really constructive dialogue about how do we remove any barriers to growth so we can all get after what we want to do, which is serving more customers more often.","So it's been a good quarter. I think there's been really constructive dialogue. Everything from unlocking one or two of the opportunities that we can get after the McDelivery opportunity more so, as well as now the local co-ops are beginning to invest a little bit more on our marketing spend on a local basis rather than national. And again to put that into context.","Certainly the vast majority of our marketing spend in quarter one last year was national as we launched the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu. We've actually now swung to a little bit more of an equal balance certainly in this first quarter as we've got behind local value and local breakfast support as well.","So I think all these things are helping just get the right balance in how we leverage our scale but also recognize the local differences as you go around the country. With regards to EOTF.","We did want to ease just some of the financial and any of the concerns operators had around the financial burden of the rapid rollout. So we offered an extra couple of years at a slightly lower supported level pretty much more our typical support level.","But the heightened support in the US through 2020 that just gave each and every Owner\/Operator an opportunity just to what we would call level load their projects if they felt was going to be too much of a pinch too much pressure on their balance sheets through 2019 and 2020.","I guess what's been interesting is the operators have really appreciated that option but the majority are still choosing to complete the EOTF projects by 2020. So I would say that we would still expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2020.","But those who felt they need a little bit longer have appreciated that opportunity and we'll support them with that as well. But it will be at the reduced level. Partly because by the time we get to 2021 and 2022 we're going to have other ways to allocate our investment support that we think will be better for the long-term business.","Kevin Ozan","And then the EOTF benefit that you mentioned Andrew. We were saying we expected it to turn around mid-year 2019. I guess I'll say there was a little bit of conservatism in that. But we also have been able to reduce our downtime on projects as we've gotten into 2019.","I think last year I talked about that there were a few things we were looking at. One to be able to reduce downtime a little bit. And two to be able to have kind of grander reopening plans so that when restaurants came back up they were able to recover the sales quicker.","And we've done a little bit better job on each of those. And so the fact that we had about 400 projects in the U.S. now in the first quarter and having all those projects that were completed in 2018 certainly made it a net positive as we got into the first quarter.","We would expect that net positive to continue now ongoing for the rest of the year. We don't want to quantify each quarter's benefit because we don't want to get into a quarter by quarter benefit it's effectively built into now our ongoing business. But we do expect that to continue for the rest of the year now.","Steve Easterbrook","And just to add on again just to emphasize the remarkable speed with which we completed projects in 2018 was clearly incredibly hard work. But what it means is now as we turn into this year you've got more than 50-50 chance of visiting a modern looking McDonald's that represents the direction we're heading into as opposed to reflecting on the past.","So we're over the halfway mark which as we have noticed from other markets around the world. Once you cross that kind of 50% as I say just from an everyday customer experience there's more chance you're going to be going to a great-looking McDonald's restaurant where the service experience is smoother the technology is more supportive in helping you through all that. So we feel good about where we're at. And we still completed 400 projects this quarter. So still feel like we're off to a good start this year.","Operator","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","And thanks for sharing the news on Jeff as sad as that is it is. He my question is a couple of things. One is Kevin is there a way to think about margins in the U.S. and how they progress. Last year margins stepped down the back half due to some of the EOTF impacts.","So should we think about it as that pressure eases in the back half? Or do you think about this is the new run rate for U.S. margins? That's question number one. And then two you did take up your G&A. and I understand why this year, is this the right new base level to run G&A at then and it kind of grows from this new I don't know whatever it is $2.2 billion level if that's where it ends up in 2019?","Kevin Ozan","Okay John I'll take both of those. I assume when you say margins we're talking about the company-operated margins on the U.S. side. Well maybe I'll talk about both since I wasn't sure actually. On the company operated side we have a few things going on as you know.","Commodity costs were up about 3% in the first quarter. We've said that will be about 2% to 3% for the year. So that should get a little bit better as the year goes on but not easing I'll be say a ton.","The other things that we do have as we went into this year we talked about depreciation from the company operated EOTF projects as being about $15 million for the year. So obviously about a quarter of that is going to hit each quarter.","And then certainly kind of wage pressures are going to continue to impact us. I'd say the one piece where there is some opportunity going forward is on labor productivity side. There are two things right now that are negatively impacting or have been negatively impacting labor productivity.","One being the EOTF projects that we've had. And so as those company-operated projects start winding down that should help some of our productivity. We'll finish all of the company-operated EOTF projects this year so that will be a help as we move forward.","And the other is the fact that guest counts are still negative. With negative guest counts that does create a challenge just from the labor productivity side. And so I think if once we're able to turn guest counts positive that will help the labor productivity side also.","The other thing I would just note I guess is the company-operated comp sales are a little bit lower than our overall comp sales. And so the 4.5 that we reported for the U.S. based on where we run our company-operated restaurants and the challenging geographies there we didn't achieve that 4.5 on the company operated side.","That put a little bit more pressure on the company-operated margins also. The plus of that is I know you guys often looked at company-operated margins as a proxy if you will for how the franchisees are doing. The Franchisees cash flow has been up every month for the last five months through March.","So that's a big positive from our franchisees side. And as you know with us running about 95% franchised in the U.S. that's really important for our business. And so that's a big positive. On the franchise margin side there's two things that impacted our franchise margin percentage this quarter.","One is the EOTF depreciation. Again we talked about it as we entered the year there's about $100 million of pressure from EOTF depreciation on the franchise margins. So again about a quarter of that hits each quarter.","Second is this change in the way we present subleasing income and expenses as a result of the new lease standard. So that impacted U.S. franchise margins by about 130 basis points.","It doesn't impact the dollars because the offset to that is revenue. So effectively there's about $20 million or so that we now just gross up revenue and gross up franchise costs but it does reduce that franchise margin percentage if you work through the math. So those are the margins.","On the G&A side we talked about and I mentioned in my script obviously two things are impacting G&A this year. The biggest one obviously is the acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Along with that though we've also started investing in some R&D and a few others areas of technology.","And the combination of those is what has caused our revision in guidance. The plus is over the last few years we have saved on a gross basis over $600 million. And so we've reduced the amount of kind of maintenance run the day-to-day business G&A and now we're investing a bigger percentage of our G&A in growth based G&A. Moving forward the way we think about G&A is it should be roughly around 2% of systemwide sales or so. So that's the way we think of it on a go-forward basis.","Steve Easterbrook","And John I just want to thank you for your comments on Jeff. I know many of you on this call would have had time with Jeff. And I was honored to attend the funeral Mass yesterday, for Jeff the occasion was an absolute testament to the memory and the celebration of all that Jeff contributed to life in general and all of our lives.","And just as a reflection on just the way that we believe in the uniqueness of the McDonald's family the turnout of owner\/operators suppliers and colleagues past and present was just absolutely enormous yesterday and again speaks to the three-legged stool and the impact Jeff had. So thank you for your comment on that. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. Can you guys speak to a little bit on the delivery side. I'm just looking at how much perhaps was from that $3 billion incremental stemming from the U.S. I'm trying to figure out the percentage that you're doing in delivery now. I know last time you spoke I think it was still coming in around 70% incremental.","I'm wondering if that rate has come down a little bit because obviously the comp was very strong. I'm just curious though if it's around that almost 10% level or so or $1 billion of your system sales that perhaps is that the majority of the comp and is the incrementality may be slowing a little bit from that 70% level?","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Matt. Again broader commentary on delivery. We certainly have been finding in these initial first couple of years that the majority of that business is incremental and that the growth and even the year-on-year growth once we got it established is really driven by raising consumer awareness and then just getting more people familiar with the fact that we offer McDelivery in the first place.","That incrementality stays strong. It's probably fair to say that we got a quicker leap on delivery in many of our international and mature international markets the likes of UK, Australia, France, Canada and a number of our midsized markets doing some pretty strong numbers as well whether that's Netherlands and Belgium and Spain and Italy.","So they're now actually beginning to comp themselves. And not only are we adding new restaurants as the third-party operators expand their networks but we're also beginning to get the year-on-year comp on delivery as well.","So we can track that and we're getting some really, really encouraging numbers as we get into that second year. So even though those came out of the traps really, really strong. We're getting comp delivery growth as well as adding new incremental restaurants which is great.","It's fair to say we had a slightly slower start in the U.S. So it begun to contribute to the comp as we worked our way through 2018 but not in a particularly significant fashion.","But as we've been working with Uber Eats in particular on coverage and trying to get as competitive a deal that both supports the partnership with Uber Eats but also helps the unit economics for our owner\/ operators we believe that we're on the verge of unlocking some of that delivery potential more within the U.S.","So once we have a good number of restaurants up on delivery in the U. S. the actual guest counts per restaurant per day is still some way behind elsewhere in the world but we're confident that we're going to more rapidly pick up the pace.","And I think you can expect to see as we get a critical mass on our system more marketing support behind it, so that we can raise consumer awareness. And certainly the Owner\/Operator support will be no noticeable because I know they feel we had a great series of conversation through this quarter and we made it more economically exciting for them to grow the delivery business as well as their traditional business.","So we feel we're in a good place. From a $3 billion business to date we still think there is substantial growth opportunity ahead. And I can assure you from a global perspective as well as drive-thru service times being one of the KPIs that I personally have chosen to lead through this year really maximizing this delivery opportunity is another one as well. So we've got a great level focus on it. I'm certainly excited that the U.S. system has got a renewed figured behind it as well.","Matt DiFrisco","So just to confirm delivery was not the majority of the comp in the US?","Kevin Ozan","Right.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Steve in previous quarters you've talked about how your breakfast business in the U.S. has been a drag on the U.S. comp. And the question is did this daypart show a meaningful improvement as we went into the first quarter? Did it contribute meaningfully to the overall improving trends in the U. S.? So any color on breakfast would be great.","And Kevin you talked about the costs on the food basket in the U. S. going from one1 to 2 to 2 to 3. Can you just give us some more color on what drove that change in your expectations?","Steve Easterbrook","So breakfast was a meaningful contributor. I wouldn't say it was a majority contributor but it was a meaningful positive contribution to like-for-like sales in the quarter which is clearly an encouraging reversal of the previous trends that we'd acknowledged. We're still in a market share fight overall because there are more and more people offering breakfast as a competitive play.","But certainly to get back to that growth trajectory is encouraging. The other piece I would say is it really wasn't until the back end of the quarter that the shift from national to local marketing dollars really begun to take effect because that was a decision that was made towards the end of quarter four.","So it takes certainly a couple of months to adjust media buying plans marketing plans as well. So I think we feel encouraged. I know that the focus on just the restaurant operation and in particular the drive-thru played a positive role in that introducing new menu item news like the Donut Sticks further supporting the McCaf investments we've made.","They all started to contribute to that. So operations menu items and media drive marketing. So I think it was a strong start to the year but we've still got more work to do if we really want to be taking share back at that important daypart for us.","Kevin Ozan","And then Brian related to the change in commodity guidance for the year from 1 to 2 to 2 to 3 the biggest change is due to an expected increase in pork prices a little bit on beef being a little bit higher than what we originally anticipated but most of it is related to pork prices.","Operator","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi. Good morning and congrats on a great start to the year. My question is on the U. S. comp and the average check growth in the U.S. I think if I heard Kevin correctly the traffic trend didn't change much from Q4 to Q1 which suggests the check growth did accelerate. So I guess the two parts of my question are one do I have that right? And then secondly what drove that? And what do you think the sustainability of that high check growth is in the U.S.? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","I'll have the first stab at that one David. So yes average check growth helps cover up I still think the continuing decline that we recognize in guest counts. So the average check growth was strong. Clearly what we do is drill into that to see where is that growth coming from and it's a combination between product mix shifts and pricing.","And what I think is encouraging for us is that the product mix shifts which is how many items in a bundle and also what people are choosing to buy outweighs the pricing impact. You don't want the pricing to get too far away and Kevin may want to talk about our pricing levels.","But if you think about the product mix shifts as we grow the delivery business for example the average check is 1.5 to 2 times that of a traditional in-restaurant average check. So that will naturally help to skew business skew the average check higher.","As we continue to build customers using the self-order kiosks we tend to get a higher average check because people dwell a little longer at the self-order kiosks. So, And then you've got some of the menu item work we've done in terms of maybe simple things just like adding bacon.","The bacon promotion through Big Mac and on our quarter pounders. That helped us grow average check a little as well. So all these activities that we've invested in or that we've built have helped grow the product mix shift overall.","So I'm encouraged because you don't want the pricing element to be overly dominant in this year particularly when customers are still feeling the pinch a little bit. But I believe it's a combination of many of the actions that we've taken have actually started to produce a healthy growth in average check and that is what I think we feel confident can been more sustainable.","Kevin Ozan","That covered everything I was going to say. So I don't have anything else to add.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great, thank you very much, Maybe a two-part question on US profitability. The first on the labor inflation. Wondering if you can give any kind of color similar to what you give on commodities in terms of the basket and how much of it is statutory versus market pressure and how are you suggesting the franchisees absorb that which kind of feeds into the other question which is you mentioned franchisee profitability is now up five I believe consecutive months.","I'm just wondering if you'd opine on what you think the outlook is for 2019 and whether there's any initiatives you've offered in terms of how to better protect against that labor inflation and the rising COGS you just mentioned. Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Yeah. I'll start. There were 20 or 21 states that increased wages I think at the beginning of the year. So those certainly have an impact on wage rates throughout the year. As you know we sat wages for the company operated. Obviously the franchisees they make their own decisions related to wage rates.","It depends where in the country as far as what the rates are and how competitive it is with other key competitors around there. So but it is fair to say that I think labor inflation is going to continue to be a challenge. We will continue to look for ways to be as efficient as we can in our restaurant operations to try and help mitigate any of that inflation. But I think that's going to be a continuing challenge for us and the industry. So I guess I'd leave it at that.","Steve Easterbrook","The other thing I would add that clearly I mean our average starting wage now in company-owned restaurants is now more than $10 an hour. So whilst we don't collect that data from our owner\/operators. I think it's reasonable to believe that it would be a similar ish number. And clearly both of those are well above the federal minimum.","So as Kevin said, the labor cost is going up certainly far higher than any typical rate of inflation. So it's something we're very mindful of. And yeah, we work with the owner\/operators to help each other just to run the business as efficiently and effectively as we can.","The best thing we can possibly do is grow the top line. That's the best way of resolving any of these costs increases and just make sure that we don't pass any of the impact of that in a negative way through to the customers. We still want to just staff the restaurants fully and appropriately so we can offer the experience that customers expect from us.","Operator","Our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thank you. Good morning. I want to ask about driving delivery orders to McDonald's app and where are you at in that process? And how is it going and what are you learning? And I was curious about the economics of it. So clearly there's value in getting the customer data and owning that customer more or less versus the marketplace. But is that more of a value customer in the economics are similar? Or are the economics still superior just because you don't have to pay the fees to the marketplace? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","Hi, Nicole. So yes we ultimately really want to be able to offer customers two ways of ordering a meal through McDelivery. One would be directly through the third-party operator which is currently how they do.","The other opportunity we deal with is integrate it into our global mobile app. We believe we're making good progress. Obviously there's a fair bit of technology work that has to go on to integrate it.","And we believe we're going to be in a position where customers in the U.S. will be able to access it through back end of quarter three this year. And as you say part of what's important in that is that whilst protecting all necessary privacy concerns clearly we will be able to gather more customer data to begin to build up a better understanding of customers behaviors.","We've kind of sort of segued into part of what we're trying to do with our technology foundation here overall. If you think about a lot of the investment we and our owner\/Operators have made the last two or three years whether it's in developing the app self-order kiosk digital menu boards both in-store and drive-thru we're now beginning to be at the earlier stages of connecting that technology ecosystem.","And why that's important is it will allow us to better understand our customers and how they choose to experience McDonald's. And that's where introducing Dynamic Yield for example will provide us with a great opportunity to smooth the experience of customers in the drive-thru regardless of whether we know you are not.","But certainly as we start to build on this platform customers who choose to actually share their identity with us. We can be even more useful to pulling up their favorites maybe building some form of loyalty and reward for it. So there's a number of different things that we can do that will further not just modernize the experience but personalize the experience for customers.","And certainly with McDelivery being something that we can only ever see grow integrating that into our own technology ecosystem is an important move forward.","And we're certainly having really healthy and constructive discussions with Uber about how we can get that done and making sure that we still protect the privacy of customers because we know how important that is for people.","Operator","Our next question is from Jake Bartlett with SunTrust.","Jake Bartlett","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Steve I'm wondering how the promotions in the first quarter in the U.S. in how they did inform your approach going forward? Looks like the bacon event was successful driving some more premium traffic or driving some check. But you also had his negative traffic and that's something you've wanted to avoid or you talked about avoiding. So going forward is the switch back to the 2 for $5 is that an indication that you want to refocus more on traffic? How much does the success of the bacon event give you confidence in premium innovation for the remainder of the year?","Kevin Ozan","Yeah. Good question Jake. I mean this is the continual balancing act or juggling act that we always had at McDonald's and the U.S. is how no different to any other market in the world. I mean how do you create new news to just continue to be top of mind for customers. However not make it so complex as it starts to be a challenge for our teams in the restaurants and therefore inadvertently impact customers.","So what we enjoyed about the success of the activity in the U.S. was it was building upon our core menu. So when you can start to use ingredients we already have in the restaurants on menu items that our crew and manager are very familiar with preparing. It really is a seamless activity and it doesn't mean we're always in the state of that.","Because I think new menu news every now and then and you probably read the occasional leak about one or two things we have got planned in the U.S. in the coming months. There will be a new menu news for maybe limited-time offers just to create a bit of a buzz and a bit of excitement. And our regular customers like trying something different every now and then but then typically revert back to what they know and what they like.","So we're kind of trying to get that balance right between further simplifying the restaurant operation. Again you probably read a couple of things we're doing to help make it easy for our teams to get things right in the restaurants.","We're taking a good look at the overnight menu and whether that was overly complex. And then most of our restaurants were already running somewhat more limited menu overnight. For us formalizing that putting some guardrails around it I think is smart and will benefit our customers that time of the day, but would also look at the premium items we have like the signature Crafted and see whether the additional complexity of preparing and some of the unique SKUs that we have in the kitchens.","Is it really worthy of that complexity or can we offer a better experience for customers by plussing up our more core and traditional menu. So it's always a juggling act. Don't think that will ever disappear at McDonald's. We've lived with it for 60 odd years. And certainly every single market we look at around the world does the same thing. It's where I would also just like to speak to some of the facilities we have here which actually helps our teams in the their markets.","We have the innovation center here which as you know is effectively a very sophisticated test kitchen where we can run our marketing programs through those kitchens and actually almost do a role-play as to what would happen.","At the peak hours given a particular type of customer arrival rate in any market in the world and actually see whether the complexity starts to derail the operation. And I can tell you that facility has never been used as widely and fully as it is now.","We've probably got 20, 30 markets that will go through there each and every year to validate that operationally we can cope with the exciting marketing and promotional plans that are being built. So we'll continue to stay close to it. And I just feel good about the conversation in the U.S that A lot of the focus is on running the restaurants and just trying to get better day in day out and more consistent. And I think customers will notice the difference","Operator","As we near the top of the hour, we have time for one more question from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. The first one, I think you guys usually give your gap to competitors in the U.S. And I'm curious what that was during the quarter. And then maybe a bigger picture question. One of your biggest competitors is implementing a plant-based product. And from what we hear it's gone pretty well. And I'm curious how you think about plant-based products fitting into McDonald's offerings and whether or not that would be too much complexity to do that? I'm just curious what are your overall thoughts on that sort of sleeve of products and how it fits into McDonald's?","Kevin Ozan","Yeah. I'll cover the comp gap and then I will let Steve talk about the plant-based protein. You know, I think we've made a decision not to keep talking about the comp gap every quarter. We feel really good about our obviously start to the year in our first quarter. Some of the competition's obviously reported their comps already.","Others will do so over the next several days. But we'll talk to our performance and let others talk to the overall industry. So we won't be sharing that core. I will tell you it was certainly positive this quarter. So we're not ceasing it or stopping because there was any issue or because it was negative. It was clearly positive this quarter but we just decided not to give that number every quarter going forward.","Steve Easterbrook","And on the plant-based question. Yeah our menu teams are clearly paying close attention to it. So when you the key for us is to identify the sustaining consumer trends. So whether if you look at veganism, whether you look at the plant-based protein opportunities what we do have the weigh up and you just mentioned it there is the is there an additional complexity? And if there is that complexity worth it? So we'll stay close to consumer demand.","I certainly know our teams are paying close attention and discussing this amongst each other and with some of the options that are out there. So maybe more to come but nothing much to say about it at the moment.","Mike Cieplak","Okay. Thank you Steve and Kevin and thank you everyone for joining our call today. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes the McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."],"13713":["McDonald\u2019s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 23, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Kathy Martin \u2013 Vice President, Investor Relations","Don Thompson \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer","Peter J.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instruction) I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson, and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast, and podcast.","And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both of these documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as our reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with a corresponding GAAP measures. And now I'd like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to join you today in my new role as CEO, and I'm honored to lead this great system of first classed owner operators, supplier partners and company employees. And I\u2019m confident that together, we will continue to build this business for all of our stakeholders under the umbrella of our global plan to win. As I said on our last call, we will stay the course; the recent change in management does not mean a change in strategy.","With that, let me provide a perspective on the quarter results and an overview of our plans as we continue to navigate this environment in the short-term and drive the business for the long-term benefit of our system and our shareholders. McDonald\u2019s continued its solid performance in the second quarter. We\u2019ve continued to grow market share despite a slowing global economy.","For the quarter, global comparable sales were up 3.7%, operating income increased 3% in constant currencies, and earnings per share reached $1.32, a 3% increase in constant currencies. And in July, global comparable sales are expected to be positive, but less than second quarter. We\u2019re experiencing stronger headwinds on both the top and bottom lines.","Some of the headwinds are macroeconomic such as declining consumer settlement and higher commodity and labor cost. Other pressures are the result of planned strategic decisions we\u2019ve made to grow the business. these include actions we've taken to enhance our value platforms, our worldwide owner, operator convention; it brings the system together every two years and investments in technology initiatives.","Despite these demands, the system remains aligned around the plan to win in our three global priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s. We\u2019re focused on driving results in this environment by continuing to refine our efforts around these priorities to address local market conditions.","So let's start with the U.S. where comparable sales increased 3.6% for the quarter and operating income rose 2%. The U.S. continues to build sales and guest counts. It is however happening at a slower pace amid an unpredictable economic environment and increased competition. Sales gains during the quarter were driven by everyday value across a variety of price points and new menu news. Breakfast continued the strong momentum with local market emphasis on core breakfast sandwiches and the introduction of Blueberry Banana Nut Oatmeal in May.","Beverages were also a key contributor to growth. The new Cherry Berry Chiller helped to drive beverage sales on top of last year\u2019s strong results, from the launch of Frozen Strawberry Lemonade. Relative to our core products, our 20 piece Chicken McNuggets were highlighted on the new extra value menu, which provides value across multiple price tiers. As a result, total sales of Chicken McNuggets increased nearly 11% during the promotional period when compared to the same time last year.","Now our focus remains on driving guest counts and we are resigning our plans as the environments shift. These plans are balanced across product categories and price tiers. For example, we\u2019re enhancing everyday value with new news and promoting core and premium products for exciting games like the Olympics sign which is starting today.","And to ensure customers have more reasons to visit us in a near-term, we will continue to leverage promotional food events like Spicy Chicken McBites and also additional McCafe flavors. Our new product pipeline also includes several new beef and chicken products and additional innovations around breakfast and beverages was currently testing a number of new products, some of which have been adapted directly from other areas of the world.","Turning to Europe, second-quarter comparable sales were up 3.8% and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. The UK and Russia delivered strong sales for the quarter, and while France and Germany are also positive. These two markets are feeling a pressure of the ongoing Eurozone difficulties. Europe\u2019s IEO industry is contracted as austerity measures continue to impact consumer purchasing power and confidence. Despite this, however, the UK, France, and Spain have gained market share. And in Germany and Italy, we are maintaining our share. So although year-to-date guest counts are down in several markets, we are faring better than the competition.","Europe is re-energizing its 2012 plans. Those plans are being re-energized to drive traffic in this environment. Markets are also placing an even stronger focus on value offerings across the menu and on promotional food events featuring premium products. The UK\u2019s success is mainly been driven by a balance of popular menu offerings in the second quarter.","The great taste of America food event as an example boosted average check, a focus on daypart expansion also contributed to results, especially at breakfast, with a new wrapped (inaudible) pork sausage, bacon eggs, potatoes and cheese wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.","Russia also continues to perform quite well with a strong focus on breakfast, lunch and beverages. Second quarter marks the seven consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable sales growth in Russia.","In France, we\u2019re increasing our media spend to further strengthen our share of voice and increasing the focus on our popular Petit Plaisir line up of smaller premium sandwiches that are priced at a mid-tier value. Germany consumers remain deal conscious in an increasingly competitive environment. We stepped up our value messaging to consistently remain customers of the great everyday value that they can get at McDonald\u2019s.","The market recently implemented mid-deal of value meal that offers a chicken classic or McChicken classic or a hamburger, Royale with Cheese along with a fry and a drink for \u20ac3.79. This contributed to strong sales and guest counts in the month of June.","Germany is also leveraging its nearly 800 McCafes with new [news] including bubble tea. This is helping strengthen multiple dayparts including breakfast and afternoon snack. From value and variety on our menu including the McRib, which is now available in 24 markets, to our ability to offer more convenience options like cashless payment in 85% of our restaurants. We are providing European customers with what they want. And our commitment and ability to execute a great relevant experience for the customer is evident in our improving customer satisfaction scores as well.","Now shifting to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa or APMIA, comp sales were up 0.9% for the quarter and operating income increased 1% in constant currencies. Across this region, we are seeing fragile consumer confidence in Australia, Japan\u2019s uneven recovery, and an economic slow down in China.","We are positioning our markets appropriately in this environment with strong value platforms to build traffic. And we will complement these platforms with average check builders that include new food news and brand extensions.","Australia\u2019s second quarter comparable sales growth was due in part to strong breakfast results, as well as the successful launch of its Olympics promotion. Additionally, the Loose Change Menu introduced in late March has helped drive guest count and sales. And as expected, once customers realize that this value offering is not going away, the use of the menu has leveled out and they are beginning to trade up to other items like extra value meals.","Japan continues to grapple with a difficult economy coupled with ongoing disaster recovery and anticipation of energy restrictions. This is taking a toll on consumers who are now eating more meals at home. Despite a significantly contracting IEO market, we continue to grow share this quarter. We responded to customers needs by rolling out a new multicare platform the 100 yen, 250 yen and 500 yen menu. We are feeling to even more customers with this new branded affordability platform. Unlike any market that implements value, our strategy is to drive sales and profitability by trading these visits up to extra value meals and other premium offers.","Utilizing our philosophy to learn, share, and scale, Japan is growing its beverage business by promoting trail of ice coffee from the U.S. through sampling events. Turning to China, in China, consumers are reacting with greater caution as the economy has slowed. We\u2019ve seen this particularly in our tier 1 cities where we are more heavily concentrated. We're also seeing high competitive activity focused on value.","In China, branded affordability has been a key part of our strategy over the last few years and we are staying to course. Value lunch and the recently launched value dinner are driving sales and guest counts that contributed to second quarter\u2019s comparable sales increase of 2.2% and market share gains in our top five cities.","China spent this growing daypart continues to be breakfast. Our ability to bundle convenience with uniquely McDonald's products is resonating with customers, not only this is daypart now represent more than 9% of sales in China, it continues to grow. We're also making sure that the brand is accessible. We remain on track to open 225 to 250 restaurants this year and also continue to focus on conveniences like make delivery and dessert kiosks.","As you can clearly see, we are operating at a more difficult global environment. And this environment requires us to be even more flexible and aggressive, particularly as economic and consumer volatility persists. And although we\u2019ve continued to deliver positive results, let me be very clear, we\u2019re not satisfied. We remain focused on appealing to customers more than anyone else as we run the business for the long-term.","The headline is this, we have a resilient business model, a talented and aligned system, and experience in every type of operating environment. We\u2019re staying focused on the things that will continue to differentiate us like our new restaurant designs. We\u2019ve already reimaged 1,000 restaurants around the world this year and remain on target to meet our goal of more than 2,400 reimages in 2012.","And, we are on course to build over 1,300 new restaurants this year in emerging markets like China, Brazil, India, and Russia, and also in more established markets including the U.S., France, Germany and Australia. We will continue to go after these new store development opportunities when and where appropriate. We have the discipline, the capital and resources to continue to do this successfully.","Now as our business grows and continues to generate significant levels of cash, our philosophy for its use remains the same. We will reinvest in the business first, and after that we\u2019ll return all free cash flow to shareholders. In fact, in the second quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","In closing, we understand what we are facing. From a macro economic environment to an increasingly competitive landscape, we\u2019ve been in situations like these before and we\u2019re drawing on net knowledge and experience to manage through these times. By remaining committed to our long-term strategies to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s while continuing to fortify our shot-term plans, I\u2019m confident we will continue to grow the business for the system and our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete.","Peter J. Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. Our focus on the plan to win and the three global priorities of optimizing the menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility continue to fuel solid top line performance. I\u2019d like to start with a few higher level comments about the quarter and then get into more detail on the results.","As you know, the macro economic environment for the past several years has been challenging and unpredictable. Our global diversification has been an advantage, as pressures felt in certain markets were often balanced with stronger performance in others.","In second quarter 2012, this wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. While we face significant cost pressures as expected, we also experienced slower sales growth in most of our major markets. Persistent unfavorable economic conditions are weighing on consumer sentiment and spending. And in many markets, we are continuing to experience flat to declining IEO traffic along with a heightened competitive landscape.","We are employing different tactics in each market to address this with the common theme being increasing the emphasis on value in the short-term to drive traffic, which is a critical element of long-term sustainable growth. These tactics are likely to take hold beginning later this year.","Relative to cost pressures, company operated margins are negatively impacted by higher commodity and labor costs. In many markets, this was on top of mid-single digit commodity cost increases last year.","Higher G&A expenses were also a headwind. As previously communicated, the $100 million of incremental G&A investments this year are negatively impacting operating income growth, especially in second and third quarters. We believe these investments in technology enhancements, Olympic sponsorship and our world-wide convention are foundational to future growth, and the long-term health of our business and brand. While we\u2019re not satisfied with these second quarter results, they are not entirely unexpected. We previously communicated that second quarter operating income growth would be affected by the volatile global economy and related headwinds along with our near-term investments.","In keeping with our historical practice, we will not be updating or providing earnings guidance going forward. While earlier this year we disclosed that we expected to meet our long-term average annual constant currency financial targets, based on what we know today considering recent trends along with the heightened global economic challenges, it appears likely that we will end 2012 at or somewhat below the 6% to 7% constant currency operating income growth target.","Now turning to results, in second quarter, system wide sales increased 6% in constant currencies. We continue to grow both global comparable sales and guest counts and are now serving 69 million customers per day, 3 million more than a year ago. This contribute to a 6% constant currency growth in franchise margin dollars and at $1.9 billion they represent approximately 70% of total restaurant margin dollars. The franchised margin percent was up 10 basis points to 83.2%.","Global company operating margin dollars for the quarter totaled [$815 million] and we\u2019re up 1% in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 80 basis points to 18.2%, as a result of softer top line results coupled with increased cost pressures. To put that 18.2% into perspective, it is our third highest second-quarter margin since the year 2000.","In the U.S., second quarter company operating margins declined 90 basis points to 19.8% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by 5% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher labor and occupancy costs. As a result of risk management efforts and supplier production efficiencies, the full-year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket has been lowered to 3.5% to 4.5%. This implies the second half increase of approximately 2%, which should be fairly balanced between third and fourth quarters.","In terms of pricing, the U.S. is running about 3% for the trailing 12 months. The food-away-from-home inflation index is projected to be up 2% to 3% in 2012. If it ends the year closer to the bottom end of the range, we may have a little less room to take pricing in the back half of the year. As always though, we will be thoughtful with future price increases speaking to maintain positive guest counts.","In Europe, second quarter company operated margins decreased 30 basis points to 19.3%, primarily impacted by higher labor expenses, 4% higher commodity costs and to a lesser extent, higher occupancy costs. Europe\u2019s projected full year commodity cost increase remains at 2.5% to 3.5%, which implies a second half increase of approximately 2% to 3%. As noted earlier this year, we have less pricing power in Europe than in the U.S. primarily due to the austerity measures. Our price increases vary by market with Russia at the high-end due to a significant inflation and all other markets averaging about 2% year-over-year. As [we\u2019ll have] prior year increases during the second half of this year, we will likely replace them with more increases.","Turning to Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins for the quarter decreased 170 basis points to 15.3% as modestly positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher labor, commodity and occupancy cost. In addition, new restaurant openings in China negatively impacted the segments margin percent. EMEA\u2019s guest count increases significantly out paid comparable sales increases for the quarter. So we are encouraged by the efforts of our franchisees and company employees that resulted in increased demand for brand McDonald\u2019s throughout the region.","As Don mentioned, in Australia, where we introduced a more robust value platform in mid March, comparable sales are steadily improving as consumers migrate beyond the value platform to the rest of the menu. This overall trend is in line with what we\u2019ve seen in other markets, when new value platforms are introduced.","Turning to G&A, second quarter cost increased 8% in constant currencies, primarily due to higher employee cost, our biennial worldwide convention in April and investments in technology enhancements. Our convention was a great success with 16,000 attendees walking away focused and aligned on our key strategies. It also provided a great opportunity to learn and share ideas from markets around the world, allowing us to better leverage our size and scale. Looking to third quarter, we expect a double-digit increase in G&A given our sponsorship of the upcoming Summer Olympics and Paralympic games in London.","With regard to other operating income, gains on sales of restaurants included the sale of 13 restaurants in two provinces in China to developmental licensees, bringing our total number of franchised restaurants in China to 54.","The second quarter effective tax rate was 33%, 120 basis points higher than a year ago. Last year\u2019s second quarter rate reflected a non-recurring tax benefit related to certain foreign operations. For the year, we continue to expect the effective rate to be between 31% and 33%.","Our business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. Our first priority remains reinvesting this cash in our business to build future returns and enhance shareholder value. This year these investments are balanced between opening more than 1,300 new restaurants and reimaging over 2,400 existing locations.","We remain committed to this effort and are making steady progress. Through June, we have opened 450 new restaurants globally. Regarding reimaging, over half of our 33,700 restaurants operate current contemporary interior, while more than a third of our exteriors reflect a new look. Reimaging our restaurants is powerful, because it is a multiyear, multilayered initiative that can enhance restaurant operations, capacity, menu and perceptions of our brand.","We continue to invest on a scale that is unmatched in our industry. It is an increasing point of differentiation and is foundational to our long-term success. Our franchisees are financially strong and have sufficient access to capital allowing them to co-invest with us to secure our collective future. Through the first six months, we have completed over 330 reimages in the U.S., 350 in Europe, and 230 in APMEA. We continue to be encouraged by the results of our reimage locations around the world.","Lastly, let me discuss foreign currency translations, which negatively impacted second quarter results by $0.07. At Friday\u2019s exchange rates, we expect third quarter EPS to be negatively impacted by $0.08 to $.10, with a full year negative impact of $0.21 to $0.23. As usual, take this as directional only, because rates will change as we progress throughout the second half of the year.","In closing, we remain focused on positively impacting those things within our control, and executing on our strategy that has proven to be a winning formula. We will continue to prudently invest today to drive growth into the future, while our business model is resilient. we are not immune from the effect of the ongoing significant global economic challenges. At the same time, we are making some short-term tax co-adjustments to address the current environment, while continuing to build a solid foundation for long-term success. We will not waver in our commitment to create enduring value for our shareholders and the entire McDonald's system.","Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy, to begin the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Kathy Martin","Thanks, Steve. I\u2019ll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) So let\u2019s begin. First is Michael Kelter from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys. I wanted to ask about the focus on value and the potential impact of profitability. So, in the short and mid-term, what are the risks that you have to meaningfully invest your margins from here to achieve the traffic results you\u2019re looking for? And then in the long-term, how do you balance any potential risk for the McDonald\u2019s brand itself in Europe and the world \u2013 when you refocusing the conversation on value and [sensibly] training consumers who want to pay less for your products?","Don Thompson","Hey, Michael, this is Don. Just, first of all thanks for the question. A couple of different things, relative to value this is part of a \u2013 its part of the platform relative to any of the media expenditures in any one of the countries that we operate in. So, value is not a new thing. The question is how much you address it relative to your marketing and media mix.","The other thing that we have to do is to make sure that we have a consistent value platform. So, we have talked about consistently last year and this year, several markets, whether they\u2019d be Australia, which was facing some economic difficulties in tough times and the need to have a consistent value base and now they have loose change, which was implemented really at the end of the first quarter and really into the beginning of the second quarter.","We talked about Germany relative to McDeals. Our new Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton was just out with them. And it is in a feeling value to consumers. At the same time, we mentioned that we have to also have a premium product messaging in the marketplace. And so we have not given up on that. All it is a tweak if you would relative to our media expenditures. But we\u2019ll continue to talk about the premium products, whether it would be in the U.S., Australia, Germany, Japan, France, any of these markets.","Kathy Martin","All right, thank you. Next question is David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Good morning, guys.","Don Thompson","Good morning David.","David Palmer \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Just a question on the cost side, when I listened to other global consumer companies often on the stable side, they talk about managing the cost and scrutinizing CapEx particularly as the going get tough. I was wondering and thinking, as you think about these coming years, it doesn\u2019t look like this environment is going to be easy going forward. And right now McDonald\u2019s is in a, what it looks like to be an investment phase both on the overhead side and the CapEx side. Is that aside when it comes to cash flow and P&L are you thinking about those things and thinking about scrutinizing those a little bit more as you kind of settle into a reality that\u2019s tougher?","Don Thompson","David, that\u2019s a good question. First of all, I\u2019ll say, around McDonald\u2019s we\u2019ve always had a practice of securitizing the costs. So while you reference the investment in overhead, I think we try to make it clear while we talked about the $100 million of incremental G&A this year that, that\u2019s not necessarily a run rate that you can project into the future. Two of those items, the Olympic and the Convention are isolated to 2012 and our investments in technology while those will continue the rate of increase relative to prior year, next year will not be at the same level that it was this year. So take those things aside, we were always scrutinizing cost and looking to be as effective and reallocate cost to drive more sales as we can.","Regarding CapEx, while you indicate the environment going forward maybe a little tougher, we don\u2019t see a fundamental shift in our business model. And so we continue to know that if we reimage our restaurants, we will create that brand differentiation, we know that even in these environments there continues to be increasing demand for brand McDonald's going forward. So we will continue to build new restaurants where we see there is to be good opportunities then we can generate good returns. So well, we are a little more cautious going forward, we don\u2019t see a dramatic change.","Kathy Martin","All right. Thank you. Next question is John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. I also wanted to come back at the margin questions, maybe just a little more specifically, your global comps are 3.7 this quarter, so nearly 4% in that than you had in the store level including food costs now, you didn\u2019t really lever labor and some of the other items, and on the franchise side, you got a little bit of leverage, but not much. So is this just an expression of the minimum comp you need and we have a view that comps are going to go now below this and so in the third quarter, is there a risk to de-levering those items or going back to the prior question, are you able to flex? And then secondly, since you talked about food cost pressures abating in the back half, which is good news, obviously, the current commodity market doesn\u2019t suggest that\u2019s going to stay good news for long, can you maybe comment about your early views about \u201913 in that context? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Hey, John, I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the flex piece and then ask Pete to talk a little more specifically about margins. One of the things that we do on a routine basis is we have clearly reviews and visits with all of the markets around the world particularly our top 10 markets. And what we really talk about is where they are positioned in terms of the opportunity to grow the business. As we look at the totality of all the markets, we then make any adjustments or capital allocations, reallocations, necessary for us to go to the real market opportunity, but always being mindful of what\u2019s taking place from consumer a level. So there are markets today then initially we began out thinking we would deploy even more capital into, but right now, we may not be performing at a level to manage that kind of capital based upon comparable sales increases and therefore returns. So we on a constant basis, look at each of the markets and how we will flex in and out in terms of any of the investments that we make. And then I\u2019ll ask Pete to speak to some of your margin questions.","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, John, regarding the commodities, our supply chain folks, our suppliers, our treasury folks really spend a lot of time earlier this year in looking at the markets and did a great job in securing a lot of our grains and other commodities at cost before they ran up related to the recent drought. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re able to lower our outlook for this year and you can imagine, while we won\u2019t get into specific details, we\u2019ve taken a greater amount of coverage for the next year, sitting here at this time, than we did half a year ago. So we feel pretty good that the impacts from the drought are going to be minimized, our next year\u2019s results as well to the extent we can see that sitting here today. But as you referenced, margins are still a top line game. And so they are dramatically impacted by our comp sales and to the extent the comp sales soften, that\u2019s where you see that deleveraging.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Ashwin Gorur Shandilya \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, this is Ashwin Shandilya filling in for Jeff. I just wanted to ask basically, in Europe where you\u2019re emphasizing more value in other markets as well. Using history as a guide, can you maybe talk about the consumer response such are focused in the short-term? I mean, I know maybe some pressure on the average check in the short-term, but for how long does that occur before customers refer it back to more normal delivering behavior. And secondly, are there major markets where you\u2019re perhaps being more or less aggressive on value and what are the expectations of those markets. Thanks very much.","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question. There are certain markets that we have focused quite intensively on, this year and also the latter part of last year to establish what we call as a value platform and we\u2019ve talked about some of those markets, Australia, Germany where we knew consumer confidence was really in question relative to the expenditures and they also have a higher propensity for savings. France, we've talked about relative to consumer confidence in the event of austerity measures.","Japan, we\u2019ve talked about relative to what they come through now in this post-recovery from the Tsunami, they\u2019re also in a tough economic environment, and clearly markets like the Spain\u2019s and Italy\u2019s of the world, and at southern part of Europe that are having some difficulties. In the U.S., value will always be a major factor, but we have to balance it as one of the earlier questions was mentioned, with premium products, with some of the beverages to offset some of the potential erosion in margin. relative to how long it takes before you recover and what you see initially. Typically, when you bring forward a new value platform, as I mentioned in the comments, customers are not used to that. in some times, I think it\u2019s going to go away. so what they begin to do initially is that they will use that menu from a purchase intent perspective much more slow initially. That usually does vain, sometimes, it may take six months; sometimes, it may take a little less or little more depending upon the overall economic situation in the country.","Kathy Martin","Okay. Our next question is Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. I have a question just more about the branded affordability in the U.S. I know you just talked about how it\u2019s always been a major factor, always been important. But one of the things that was mentioned in the call was, should the food-away-from-home inflation kind of come in at the low end of your expectation, it may limit your ability to take some pricing in the second half. Just looking back over the last couple of years, I think it\u2019s interesting because after several years of running below food-away-from-home inflation kind of year-to-date, you\u2019ve been kind of in line, maybe even slightly above. and thinking longer-term, how do we think about the broad-based positioning against that? And kind of may be regardless of the outlook, should we think of a low-cost pricing environment in the U.S. to continue to maybe come back some of the competitiveness?","Don Thompson","Hey, Keith, there are a couple of things and Pete may have a comment on this as well. So food away from home is one \u2013 it\u2019s the baseline, it\u2019s the most predominant measure that we\u2019ve historically reuse. But I have to say this, we\u2019ve also used food at home from a grocery store price index perspective, as well as commodity costs and labor costs. And so what we have to do is, look at what we think will be \u2013 what will be within the range of price sensitivity and acceptable to a consumers which has typically been food away from home. But also we have to look at what the direction of commodity. So if commodities like they\u2019re going to really ramp up. We want to make sure we\u2019re in a position to minimize the impact of margin erosion by taking appropriate price increases.","There are times when we will bump up against as you mentioned food away from home or even for a very short period, we may actually eclipse it, but we\u2019ll bring that right back in line. And that\u2019s just part of the ongoing management of what\u2019s taking place in a broader marketplace in terms of food costs, labor pressures, and then understanding what\u2019s happening with consumer confidence and disposable income.","Peter J. Bensen","And I think Keith, it also \u2013 it\u2019s fair to assume in that kind of pricing equation if you will or pricing formula, we do look at what\u2019s going on the menu boards at the competition. So, the competitive environment does, also factor into it, but Don highlighted that, it\u2019s the more macro factors that we do look at.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Matt Difrisco from Lazard.","Matthew Difrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Thank you. Pete, I wondered if you could talk about the dynamic of the franchise margin in the U.S., and try and help us understand maybe how that looks going forward, as far as it\u2019s been a several quarters of a run of margin expansion on the franchise side in the U.S. and now it\u2019s sort of flat year-over-year. You can put that into the context of what, how those \u2013 how that dynamic works going forward in an environment where \u2013 I think in the press release you said that the same store sales are going to be a little or guided to be a little slower in July and ahead than they were in 2Q?","Peter J. Bensen","All right, Matt. First, let me \u2013 July, and I know this is generally out there, but July we are facing a negative 1.8% trade day impact. So that is impacting July, as well as the fact that Ramadan is staring \u2013 started last week, so we are going to have 10 days impact of Ramadan this year in July when that was entirely in August last year. So those were a couple of things to think about when reflecting on that July guidance.","But as we said earlier, the same thing applies to franchise margins even more so that applies to company operated margins is that they are a top line gain. So they\u2019re really driven, we get tremendous leverage when we are driving comps and they tend to slowdown as comp sales slow.","The other thing specific to the U.S. is with the reimaging that\u2019s going on. We are seeing a greater increase in depreciation expense. But typically depreciation is one of those fixed costs that you could leverage with the increased sales, but with the progression of increasing the reimagings, we are continuing to layer on some additional depreciation expense, that will continue in to the near future.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Joe Buckley from Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Pete, I was wondering if maybe you\u2019ve done this already, but could you breakdown the $100 million of G&A among the three things you\u2019ve mentioned, the April convention, the Olympics and the technology program?","Don Thompson","So, Joe, we\u2019ve somewhat broken it down, and that we\u2019ve said, half of that relates to the convention in the Olympics and the other half relates to the IT investment.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham Research.","Mitch J. Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thanks very much. And I\u2019d like to ask another question about margins. In the global margin at the store level, I believe it was down about 80 bps. And Pete, is it possible just to give us a sense of maybe how much of that contraction was due to increased focus on value? And as we look out over the next couple of quarters, do you expect that emphasis to heighten or are we kind of there already? Thanks.","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, Mitch, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint precisely how much of that is related to our increased focus on value. And specifically, Don, alluded to this a little bit, when we say value, it\u2019s not just that entry point value, so it\u2019s not just the dollar menu or the one euro items in that menus. It\u2019s also some of those premium food events that are a relative value compared to the rest of the marketplace. So I know we talk a lot about value to drive transactions and the implications there, that is the entry level value and a lot of that is, but it also has different forms across the menu board. But I would say that as we focus more over these next couple of quarters, it is likely that the impact will be a little bit more, will be greater in the next couple of quarters.","Don Thompson","Hi, Mitch, just one point on this one is, what we\u2019re facing now from a global economic perspective is, we\u2019re just seeing more markets that have consumer confidence issues, and what we will consider to be more substantial levels. so this notion of value and the way we\u2019re talking about branded affordability, while it is not necessarily new in all of the markets, what we\u2019re finding is that we have to again quake up our messaging, our GRPs, our marketing spend just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers who frankly have less confidence in the overall economy, and therefore reduce the disposable spending. and so, that\u2019s why we\u2019re having as many conversations about it.","But having said that, we've been doing this in each of these markets over time, so it's not \u2013 they're not typically new things, there are a couple of markets where it's new, Japan let\u2019s say or in Australia with loose change, but particularly as they\u2019ve been in France, the U.S. has had a value based menu, Germany\u2019s had SMS. What we\u2019re finding is we may need to quack that up just a little bit more to appeal to some of these consumers. This is the time for us to really focus on guest count growth and market share gains. And so we\u2019d really go at this very hard in times like these even though that means an investment.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, great. Thanks. First, just a really quick follow-up and then the question. Pete, when is that IT investment recur in fiscal \u201813 or is it the $100 million gone from fiscal \u201913, so that\u2019s the first question? And then secondly, just thinking about the UK, I mean obviously, there is the Jubilee and the Olympics and there has just been so much kind of going on into that market overall. I mean how do you think about the UK in general and in the second half of the year and in the \u201813 and is McDonald\u2019s doing anything proactive to perhaps prepare for, I don\u2019t know if that happens or not, but a slowdown like it happened in the UK for the rest of Europe as some of these events come in the past?","Peter J. Bensen","Hey, John, I'll take the first part of your question, and then Don can give you a perspective on the UK But the $50 million incremental technology investment spending this year, that will stay in our base and that level of spending will recur next year. So to say it differently, $50 million for the Olympics and conventions does not repeat next year, but the technology spent continues, but obviously, at a zero increase, if we spend the same amount. With that, I\u2019ll ask Don to talk about the UK.","Don Thompson","Hi, John, Beijing \u2013 so if I look back to Beijing, Vancouver, post the Olympics, what we typically do is, we go back to business as usual. So we don\u2019t foresee a huge shift or change in terms of our base trim line in the UK as we move forward. Having said that, the UK will be facing some tougher austerity measures in the latter half of the year, and so as those things come into play, we\u2019ve got to again make sure, we\u2019re looking at all of the macro economic factors in the market and making appropriate adjustments. We\u2019ve done quite well in the UK, we\u2019re balancing our growth across all the menu tiers and that will continue. But we\u2019ll have to continue to look at the market, but right now, we don\u2019t foresee anything that will cause a substantial change in the base trend line.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.","Jason Taylor West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks guys. I just wanted to talk about the U.S. market a little bit, you\u2019ve obviously seen somewhat a down shift in the sales trend though the others are still healthy. You\u2019ve seen a slow down from the last couple of quarters. If you could talk about how much of that is kind of a consumer macro driven, I\u2019ve seen people trading down to the dollar menu, value menu, things like that versus competitive activity that you\u2019ve alluded to. It seems like the competitive activity not necessarily value oriented all the time, some of its new product oriented and just marketing oriented. If you can just kind of compare that to maybe other periods of slow down? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Great question, Jason. A couple of things, we\u2019re seeing a hike in competitive activity across the IEO marketplace, which is an interesting point because it\u2019s not just in QSR, we are seeing it across all of IEO from fast-casual to convenience and grocery stores. I haven\u2019t said that, for us as McDonald's what matters most is to remain focused on what\u2019s within our realm of control. So we will talk about the value platforms, we talked about beverages, breakfast, we talk about premium based products and promotional food events like McBites. We\u2019ve just got to make sure that we are appealing the customers more so, but we are seeing to your point, we are seeing that competition.","Now, the other thing is that there is an increase in terms of marketing spend by many of the folks in the competitive segment. So we have to clearly be able to make sure that our strength of voice and our share of voice is still resonating with consumers out there and we build awareness for the McDonald's brand. So this is not new, we go through competitive fresher\u2019s and there will resurgences and a kind of ebbs and flow from time to time. But what it means for us is we just got to be focused on our business plan and execute that at the highest level.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.","Andy M. Barish \u2013 Jefferies & Co., Inc.","Yeah, can you just give us a little sense on sort of the China business, how much the last quarter slowdown was kind of \u2013 your thoughts internally, more value kind of value dinner having a negative impact on mix et cetera versus sort of the external environment, if there is a way you are sort of looking at that?","Don Thompson","Yeah, Andy, relative to China, so clearly we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a slowdown economically and we talked about the Tier 1 cities, which is where we are, which is where our presence is absolutely the strongest, it\u2019s where we are concentrated. Those markets seem to be facing much stronger macro economic pressures than clearly the Tier 3s, 4s, those cities that are outside of the core in terms of where our focus has been. So we are seeing some macro economic pressures.","On the value side, we are seeing a little bit more media and marketing around value-based products. Clearly, I think we are in a pretty good position there relative to the overall marketplace in China. But the other thing is that, for us, it\u2019s got to be consistent when you execute value. So, if you look at last May, June timeframe, we were running 13% and 16% comps. And so as we went into this year, we knew that those were fairly high hurdles.","Nonetheless, if we execute the existing value lunch strategy, value dinner adding strategy; breakfast is our fastest growing take part in China. We\u2019ll continue to do well in the marketplace. But we have focused on a little bit more based on consumer confidence measures. We have focused a little bit more on a value side in China as well.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.","Howard W. Penney \u2013 Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering if you might be able to quantify what you are seeing in the global markets as you\u2019ve described in the call today, the slowdown anyway that you are seeing from the consumer, because you\u2019ve done 5.4% comps for the six month this year, your worst year in the last five was 2008 at 3.8% for you or 2009 at 3.8%.","So, you\u2019re doing, I think significantly better and you had a better earnings performances, I don\u2019t believe you missed the numbers back in 2008, 2009. So, what is that in the global marketplace that you are seeing is causing the issue McDonald\u2019s is seeing, from a top line perspective you\u2019re doing much better than what is arguably a far more difficult economic environment in 2008, 2009?","Peter J. Bensen","Howard, couple other things, one is that we started this year and we had the benefit of the leap year and we had the benefit of the unusually warm winter, in a lot of places around the world. So the first quarter while it was strong, there were a couple of things that boosted that beyond the wherewithal normal performance churn event. But as you look around the world, I\u2019d say, one of the changes is just the length of this economic challenging period. Back in \u201908 and \u201909, I think people thought this was an issue, it was going to come, it was going to go, it didn\u2019t dramatically change consumer behavior. They did change some, but not dramatically, and I think now, that it\u2019s persistent for so long, and especially in Europe, it\u2019s gotten so much deeper in some of these countries that it is really starting to constrain consumer behavior, several of the markets there, the Eating Out market is just simply declining. People are staying at home, they aren\u2019t going out and the magnitude of the issues in Europe are having ripple effects around the world. And the most significant is, it is impacting the consumer\u2019s behavior and whether that means they are saving more or they\u2019re just going out less. All in all it is meaning more flattish to declining eating out generally around the world.","Don Thompson","An interesting point, we look at it quite often is, we\u2019ve been at points what we\u2019ve seen is one or two markets of our top 10, maybe three or four that might be experiencing some of these consumer confidence issues, this is one of the first times when we\u2019ve seen in a much broader base perspective, so it\u2019s a little bit more than European cold, if you would, it\u2019s kind of a little bit more a global piece that we\u2019re seeing, across the board. So what all it means for us is that the things that we\u2019ve employed historically, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re in the best position again to drive in, additional traffic in the restaurant to be able to trade those up, but we\u2019re making substantial investments to be able to do that now in all of the markets that we\u2019ve talked about. And we\u2019re seeing some results in terms of some of that the guest count movement, but we may not necessarily see those sales flow down to bottom line until we\u2019ve got into a point where we can really trade those guest counts up.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar.","R.J. Hottovy \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","Good morning. And I just wanted to follow-up on the product pipeline that Don had mentioned in the U.S. You gave some hints about some new products that maybe in the pipeline. but maybe the broader question just more specifically what we may be seeing in the back half of the year in 2013, and based on the success of McBites program earlier in the year, there\u2019s any learnings or any product platforms you\u2019ve seen elsewhere in the world that may be successful or do you think, it may have potential is the U.S. just any commentary on that would be helpful? Thanks.","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah. R.J., a couple of them, you guys have seen that we\u2019ve showed at whether it was a NIM or some of you saying these in business to the innovation center et cetera. but clearly the beverage platform, we\u2019re seeing has quite a bit of resonance and it is being looked at by many markets around the world as we move forward there. But also wraps it\u2019s a platform, you guys have seen the wraps, the wraps are being looked at in many markets around the world, we\u2019re in quite a few countries across Europe right now, but the variations in the wrap whether beef or chicken, your ability even going to shrimp and fish have been quite tremendous, we\u2019ve even done some breakfast work with those wraps as I mentioned today.","So we\u2019re seeing those kind of platforms move around quite a bit. On the premium sandwich side, that was \u2013 I think it was at the Investor Meeting, we showed you guys a burger called the Pub Burger in the U.S., those type sandwiches that are more premium beef sandwiches and we can also do premium chickens are some of the sandwiches that have resonated in Europe. And so you can look forward to seeing some sandwiches similar to that, next year for sure impossibly, possibly even the latter part of this year.","Kathy Martin","And our next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Hi, thank you. I wanted to sort of ask the question about the unit growth that you are seeing, you mentioned them growing in emerging markets and then you also subsequently made comments about thinking about allocating CapEx and making sure that the returns are there. I guess when I think about your growth algorithm, the one you laid out, and you said \u2013 that you expect to return too. It\u2019s usually I think has some low single-digit comps, or a single-digit unit growth with the top line. I\u2019m just trying to understand, if your growth shifts more toward emerging markets, shouldn\u2019t that mean that for any given amount of unit growth, you probably have less of a contribution to the top line, because they tend to be either lower volume or in the case of Latin America license. So should we be thinking, will that mix become more pronounced over time, I guess this is the question, so that your system wide unit growth may increase, but it will have a diminishing impact on your revenue growth?","Don Thompson","Hi, Sara. So we talked about Brazil, I highlighted Brazil as one of those countries, but in Brazil as a development licensee, it was the only country that I have mentioned in large part that is a development licensee wholly from that perspective, When you look at the other countries we\u2019re growing in, whether it be China, yes, lower average unit volumes, but we\u2019re growing quite aggressively as you know in China, the growth that we have in some of the others, the India\u2019s and the Russia\u2019s, other world. In India, we have a developmental licensee and a joint partner; in Russia, that is a wholly-owned market, so it\u2019s all McOpCo; the U.S. we have a mix; markets like France we have a similar mix and closer to that 80% to 90% franchise kind of a range, but it is the traditional franchise. So, we have growth across many markets and the ownership structures are a little different. So as we look at the allocation of capitals, we're looking how we can get maximum returns, but we are also look into see what customers want more McDonald's. That\u2019s the first and most important thing, where are the true growth opportunities to build the business and build a system wide sales.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Phillip Juhan from BMO Capital Markets.","Phillip A. Juhan \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Yeah. Thanks guys. This is Phillip Juhan at BMO. Pete, I was hoping you can may be quantify some of the labor wage rate pressure you\u2019re seeing and where that might be the most secured in terms of geography, it\u2019s a little tough to reconcile with 2% to 3% pricing in place. How you guys are actually thinking, deleverage on that line against the back drop of sort of economic softness in general?","Peter J. Bensen","Phillip, we're seeing wage pressure in virtually every market around the world. U.S. there continues to be increases in the average rate. I think there were seven states that hit normal wage at the beginning of the year at a 4% to 5% clip, which are impacting that. In addition in the U.S. we continue during the quarter to invest labor enrolling in the peek hour and so that added a little bit of pressure to the labor line. If you go into Europe, not only our wage is increasing but some of the austere measures in Europe include, additional social charges, an additional payroll type taxes, that are putting pressure on the wage rates. And in Asia, a lot has been written about China and the pressure on wages there, so we're experiencing wage pressure there as well, so it\u2019s clearly a global phenomenon for us.","Kathy Martin","All right. We\u2019re about out of time but we\u2019ve got a couple additional folks in the queue. So, we\u2019re going to take these next couple of questions; Joe Buckley from Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Buckley \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah, just want to ask about the European same store sales increase in the month of June, actually it was pretty strong and you mentioned McDeal in Germany, but when more value initiatives in place, what sort of the timing of the \u2013 [you said about] focus on value in Europe?","Don Thompson","Hey, Joe, thanks for the question. Couple of different things, clearly in Germany, SMS and we talked about this back, I think it was April or May, SMS has been stepped up. We have to put more marketing dollars, immediate dollars behind it. Also they created the \u20ac3.79 McDeal. So Germany, they did implement that albeit toward the end of the second quarter.","In France, Petit Plaisir is across the Board now. It\u2019s something else that we had mentioned and what they don\u2019t have yet is a one sandwich type price point value but their base value platform is Petit Plaisir. So we haven\u2019t gone all the way to Eurosaver there. At this stage, the franchisees are discussing next steps. But we believe we\u2019re in a pretty good competitive position in France right now.","The UK has continued on Eurosaver\u2019s. Markets like Spain and Italy are in a value proposition called Uno por Uno, and I would tell you Spain has executed this quite well over the last several years and they are performing well even in the state that the economy in Spain has had, but there are other markets.","Italy is a tough market for us. Italy right now even with the value proposition for those of you who visited Italy, you know there is a lot of street side cafes and their value proposition is a lower tier even than what we proposed at McDonald\u2019s Uno por Uno. So, we have to continue to try to see how we can breakthrough in a marketplace like that. So it does vary a bit, but we are seeing some early results nonetheless we have to stay diligent in all of those markets.","Kathy Martin","And our final question is from Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisory Group.","Peter Saleh \u2013 Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great thanks. I know it\u2019s a little early to be talking about 2014, just wondering what your thoughts are on healthcare costs and if you have any kind of estimates around what that could do on a per unit basis. And what steps could you take in 2013 to kind of get ahead of that.","Peter J. Bensen","Peter, our current estimate is healthcare is going to impact each individual restaurant in the range of $10,000 to $30,000. That obviously a wide range, but there is a lot of different factors when you look at the healthcare law that impacts the number of employees, the number of full time employees, what is the current healthcare offering from the owner operator for McOpCo. So there are a lot of variables, but I will tell you that we are significantly increasing now that the Supreme Court has ruled increasing our conversation and disclosures with franchisees around what this mean for brand McDonald's. So that they can be as educated as possible around what\u2019s happening so that they can start to anticipate and make any changes that they have to try to minimize the impact of this.","And on a just a dollar basis that $10,000 to $30,000, we have years like last year where commodity cost increases were even greater than that. So while this is a significant item and it\u2019s gaining a lot of attention as the P&L item we\u2019ve managed through items of this magnitude in the past and I\u2019m hopeful we can do that in future.","Kathy Martin","All right. I\u2019ll turn it over to Don now with the few closing comments.","Don Thompson","First, I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, we continue to deliver solid results, because the entire McDonald\u2019s system, franchisees and supplier partners, company employees, it is the most aligned it has ever been as we continue to execute our plan to win, and the three global priorities that we\u2019ve established in optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience, and broadening accessibility to our brand.","I\u2019m also confident that with our solid strategic plans to gain market share over the long-term and the experienced senior leadership team that we have and the ongoing communications we have with franchisees, we\u2019ll continue to grow the business for the system and for our shareholders. We remain steadfast in our commitment to our long-term strategies as we make smart and strategic decisions to mitigate short-term pressures in these challenging times. So, again, thanks for joining us today. And have a great day."],"13808":["McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) Q1 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call April 22, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Kathy Martin - VP of Investor Relations","Don Thompson - President and CEO","Pete Bensen - Chief Financial Officer","","Analysts","","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","David Tarantino - Baird","David Palmer - RBC","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse","John Ivankoe - JP Morgan","Alex Chan - Jefferies","","Operator","Hello and welcome to the McDonald\u2019s April 22, 2014 Investor Conference Call. At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson and our Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast.","Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also applies to our comments. And these documents are both available on our website at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are any reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","For now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. We began 2014 with our strategies and our business miles sound and intact. From a financial standpoint, our system\u2019s number one goal remains enduring profitable growth, which starts with continuing to grow customer visits and comparable sales. From our diversified geographic portfolio that leverages the entrepreneurial power of local ownership to the breadth of our menu across day parts and meal occasions, our strategies, infrastructure, and investments support this goal. And while we expect the market dynamics to remain similar to 2013, we do have experienced effectively competing in challenging operating environments and I remain confident in our ability to be successful at McDonald\u2019s.","Our global growth priorities are focused on ensuring that we remain relevant and appealing, so that more customers will visit us more often. We\u2019re focused on optimizing our menu so that we offer our customers food and drinks that have strong appeal, on modernizing the customer experience in our restaurants, so that that experience for each customer is more memorable; and on broadening accessibility so that we deliver on unparalleled convenience. The key to our growth lies in our ability to place the customer at the center of everything that we do.","Over the past few months, I had the opportunity to visit our priority markets, the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia with Steve Easterbrook, Pete Benson and Tim Fenton. We focused on more deeply understanding how each of those markets are adjusting their plans to address current challenges and adapt to the environment and to our customers\u2019 expectations.","There were four opportunities that were common to these markets and are being fortified in many other countries in which we operate. First, we're strengthening our planning process to more effectively bridge consumer insights into the right customer center plans and actions, while striking the right balance against our internal financial objectives. Second, we're strengthening our marketing messaging to better resonate with customers and create stronger awareness. Third, we're enhancing our affordability platforms to ensure our value offers are consistent and clearly message. We want our customers to feel good about the value that they get when they visit us at McDonald\u2019s. And finally, we're more effectively balancing our focus on the core menu including the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin and our world famous fries.","Our core products are familiar favorites for our customers. They truly represent McDonald\u2019s to all of our customers and at about 40% of total sales, they are an incredible business asset for us that requires a constant drumbeat of communication.","Now our area of the world our local market teams are translating these learnings along with specific market findings into comprehensive action plans to improve the customer experience. A good example is the recent changes made in U.S. marketing to more directly align our marketing efforts with targeted consumer segments. I\u2019ll talk more about this change and actions being taken in the other priority markets a little bit later.","It\u2019s important to underscore that it will take time for consumers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits. This is not about a silver bullet; rather it\u2019s about optimally sequencing multiple customer focus initiatives and executing them very well. While, we expect results in these core markets to remain volatile in the near-term, we are confident in our ability to improve overtime.","Now beyond our priority markets, we continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives that drive system wide performance. In addition to our ongoing emphasis on menu, these include brand extensions like McCaf\u00e9 beverages, desert kiosks and delivery; they include increasing our global footprint through new restaurant opening in both established and emerging markets and by continuing to modernize our restaurants through reimaging.","And also by leveraging the investments that we have already made in the restaurants, particularly relative to restaurant technology like our global point of sell platform and in-store wireless access to support our digital efforts focused on engaging more deeply with our customers and differentiating the McDonald\u2019s experience.","Finally in addition to market level activities, we are also evaluating opportunities to enhance shareholder value, while maintaining long-term financial strength. Now Pete, will speak more about this area of focus in his comments.","Let me switch gears now and discuss global results. Year-to-date March our global comparable sales increased 50 basis points with positive performance in all segments except the U.S. Operating income was up 1% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.21, a 2% decrease in constant currencies.","Comparable guest counts for the quarter continue to be negative. Our priority markets of the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia drove that decline. Comparable guest counts would have been positive excluding those markets, while recent signs indicate economies maybe stabilizing several of our major markets, the projections for the informal eating out industry call for flat to modest growth in 2014. With this as a backdrop, April global comparable sales are expected to be modestly positive.","Let\u2019s now move to performance by area of the world and address our priorities going forward. In the U.S., comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.7% and operating income declined 3% driven by negative guest counts due impart to severe winter weather. The U.S. is focused on strengthening the customer experience through better operations and service execution, balanced focus between our core and new products and enhancing marketing effectiveness, while maximizing our opportunities to grow our breakfast.","Because service is such a foundational element of the customer experience, we recognized the need to elevate our service levels to ultimately build visits. During the first six months of this year, our franchise and company-owned restaurants are engaged in what we call a reset, which emphasizes the importance of proper staffing, scheduling and positioning of crew to build restaurant capacity, particularly during peak hours.","Now early I mentioned changes that have been made within our U.S. marketing group. We\u2019ve adjusted our marketing calendar so that we are introducing the appropriate number of new and promotional products. And we are better sequencing them to maximize restaurant execution and the contribution to comparable sales.","We are also looking to harness the power of our marketing strength especially in support of our core menu. We are focused on creating a greater emotional connection between customers and our core products through our advertising and media spend. Those things combined with the fresh perspective of our new U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, these balanced menu changes and focused media strategies will allow us to strengthen our appeal to customers by offering them what they truly want, great food and great service at an affordable price.","Finally, as the leader of the important and growing breakfast day part, we\u2019ll continue to build on the strength of our morning business. Today customers choose McDonald's because of our great product, cooked in our restaurants and our kitchens. We grab fresh eggs, we grill sausage and bake it, we bake biscuits and we toast muffins, all to serve up a delicious breakfast that is accompanied by our outstanding McCafe coffee. These things truly set us apart and position us to continue growing this day part into the future.","Now moving over to Europe. Comparable sales were up 1.4% for the quarter and operating income was up 4% in constant currency. Positive comparable sales performance in the UK, France and Russia was partially offset by Germany\u2019s negative results. While we\u2019re encouraged by positive comparable sales trends and recent economic indicators that appear to be stabilizing in many markets across Europe, we remained cautious in the near-term, given a tenuous operating environment. Both the UK and Russia have successfully focused on growing breakfast, while balancing the core menu with strong promotional activity that is resonating with local customers.","In France, successful marketing support for premium products and limited time offers along with the stronger affordability platform have contributed to the 8th consecutive month of positive comparable sales growth amid of declining IEO industry. Germany is one of the priority markets with persistent negative sales and guest count momentum.","The new management team is working to rebuild consumer trust through a more relevant and consistent affordability platform. We\u2019ve also adjusted our menu and marketing calendar to do a better job of connecting with customers, by reducing and better balancing our core menu favorites with new food and beverage offers.","Now let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were up 80 basis points for the quarter and operating income decreased 2% in constant currencies. Solid comparable sales performance in China and many other markets was somewhat offset by weakness in Japan and to a lesser extent Australia.","In China, comparable sales increased 6.6% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of the residual effects of consumer sensitivity related to last year\u2019s supply chain issue in the chicken industry. China\u2019s ongoing focus on brand extensions like delivery and dessert kiosks is strengthening our appeal as a convenient brand.","Sales from our delivery business continue to grow at a double-digit pace. And while about 30% of the total restaurants in China offer delivery, these restaurants are concentrated in our key cities and offer additional customer benefits such as minimum delivery times and 24-hour service.","We continue to see significant growth potential throughout APMEA. In China, we plan to open about 300 new restaurants this year. We also continue to accelerate our franchising efforts; about 15% of restaurants in China are franchised as of the end of the quarter and we are on track to achieve our mid-term target of 20% to 25% franchise restaurants.","In Australia, recent comparable sales are negative due in part to the shift and timing of the monopoly promotion this year. The market is enhancing its affordability platform by adding new meal bundles to the Loose Change menu to strengthen our value offer and remind customers that we have something for everyone.","Japan continues to experience negative comparable sales in guest count trends amid a highly competitive environment. Looking ahead, Japan is focused on offering more relevant food and beverage choices, increasing the focus on the family business and repositioning the affordability platform to rebuild our customer connection and stabilize our performance.","As we look forward, the market is also monitoring consumer reaction to the 3% consumption tax increase that occurred on April 1st. Around the world, we\u2019re working hard to ensure our actions are driven by what our customers want and need from us today and tomorrow. As our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our philosophy regarding the use of cash remains unchanged.","Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to capitalize on the sizeable long-term growth opportunities that exist. And after reinvesting in the business, we\u2019re committed to returning all of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases combined.","I want to close by reemphasizing my confidence in McDonald\u2019s future. Approximately 70 million customers per day across a geographically diverse portfolio of over 35,000 restaurants is a very strong foundation from which we operate. Our infrastructure and our fundamentals are sound. We\u2019re leveraging the power of our proven business model, our investments in restaurant capabilities and modernization and our hard earned competitive advantages to pursue the sizable opportunities that are before us.","At the same time, we\u2019re thoughtfully evolving our approach to remain relevant, making appropriate adjustments to navigate near term challenges while driving enduring profitable growth for our system and for our shareholders over the long term. Thanks again everyone, and I will now turn it over to Pete.","Pete Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The McDonald\u2019s system entered the year with the realistic view of our near term opportunities get a firm focus on our path to long term success. We are diligently managing those things within our control while continuing to position the McDonald\u2019s system for future growth.","The battle for market share is expected to persist given projections for flat to modest category growth in our major markets this year. But over the long term the $1.2 trillion global and formal leading out category should grow more significantly, and I expect McDonald\u2019s to fully participate in that growth.","One of the reasons I am confident in McDonald\u2019s future is the strong phase off of which we operate. First quarter results were in line with our expectations and highlighted the resiliency of our system and financial model. Though top line growth was challenged, McDonald\u2019s generated $1.9 billion of operating income. This is an impressive number. But I am even more encouraged by the significant long term opportunities we see to drive future growth.","Turning to first quarter performance. We are primarily a franchiser with 81% of our global restaurants franchised; as such our profitability is driven primarily by top line performance. Modest comparable sales growth combined with higher expenses and lower gains from sales of restaurants contributed to a 60 basis point decline in our combined operating margin to 28.9% through March. The largest component of operating income is our franchise margins, representing approximately 70% of total restaurant margin dollars, franchise margins which are driven by a relatively steady and predictable stream of rent and royalties grew to approximately $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 3% constant currency increase driven primarily by expansion. The consolidated franchise margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 81.1%, highlighting the need for stronger comparable sales gains to offset increased expenses and maintain this margin percent.","Global company operated margin dollars grew to $723 million while the margin percent decreased 10 basis points to 16.1% due to higher labor, commodity and occupancy cost which were offset by positive comparable sales. In the U.S. company operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.3% as the positive impact from higher average check primarily driven by pricing was offset by negative guest counts and higher commodity and crew labor costs.","First quarter commodity cost in the U.S. rose nearly 3% driven primarily by higher protein cost. We expect similar pressure in second quarter than easing throughout the second half of the year. The full year outlook for the U.S. grocery basket remains a 1% to 2% increase.","At the end of March the price increase in the U.S. was about 3% higher versus a year ago. While the food away from home inflation index is 2.3% through March, it is projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. In addition we have seen more significant increases over the past two months in food at home inflation which is also projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. We watch these indices closely, yet are also mindful of cost pressures not only in 2014 but next year as well, when making our pricing decisions.","Turning to Europe, company operated margins increased 30 basis points to 17%, as strong performance in France and the UK was partially offset by higher commodity costs in Russia due to the impact of the weaker Russian ruble on import cost. Europe\u2019s grocery bill was relatively flat in the first quarter and we expect more pressure in the second half of the year with the full year increase still projected at 1% to 2%. And across Europe, the average menu price increase excluding Russia is about 2%.","In Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins declined 60 basis points to 14% as positive comparable sales were offset by higher labor, occupancy, and other costs, while the margin percent grew in several markets including China and Australia refranchising in Australia and the weaker Australian dollar negatively impacted the segment\u2019s overall margin percentage. In addition, the new restaurant openings primarily in China contributed to the lower margin percent, though to a lesser extent than in 2013.","G&A for the quarter increased 4% in constant currencies. Over half of this increase was due to our sponsorship of the Winter Olympic and parallel Olympic games in Sochi. We expect to experience a more significant G&A increase next quarter due to our worldwide convention and cost related to other initiatives such as restaurant growth, capacity enhancements and our digital capabilities.","First quarter effective tax rate was 32.4% and represented a significant increase versus the prior year rate of 30.1% which was aided by a tax benefit of nearly $50 million. We continue to project the 2014 full year rate to be between 31% and 33%. We [already] committed to investing in our business to drive future growth and returns, we allocate capital in a discipline measured way opening new units across a diversified portfolio of markets, while making prudent investments in existing restaurants.","We are on track to open 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 in affiliated and developmental licensee markets. We also expect to reimage over a 1,000 existing restaurants. The rollout of the new kitchen equipment in the U.S. is progressing nicely and we are on track to have it installed in all restaurants by mid-year.","As I discussed at a couple of investor conferences last month, we are moving with more urgency to address recent financial performance in our priority markets. In addition to these efforts which Don covered we're actively looking at ways to improve shareholder returns by optimizing our capital structure, while maintaining our long term financial strength; optimizing our ownership structure including certain refranchising activities especially in markets outside of the U.S. and scrutinizing ongoing G&A while appropriately supporting our franchisees and our growth initiatives. As I said at the conferences these additional areas of focus do not represent a change in strategy or financial philosophy, they fit squarely within our business model.","We are not beginning with a given target in any of these areas, but instead are evaluating them with the ultimate screen of creating value by doing what is right for the business over the long-term.","Financial discipline has been a cornerstone of a plan to win and that certainly will continue because I believe a strong financial foundation is a critical component to building enduring profitable growth.","It's premature to comment on any specifics, but we expect to provide an update on our progress over the next couple of months.","Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. At current rates including the stronger euro, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted with a full year negative impact of about $0.03 to $0.04. As usual, this is directional guidance only, because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year.","In closing, I'm confident in our fundamental business model and our competitive position. We're the global leader in a $1.2 trillion industry, yet have less than 8% market share providing significant opportunity for future growth.","Our geographically diversified portfolio and various ownership structures allow us to optimize our investments within a market. We are aligned with our outstanding owner operators and suppliers to leverage our distinct competitive advantages. And we are making strategic investments today to seize those opportunities to create long-term value for our customers, shareholders and the entire McDonald\u2019s system. Thanks.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks Pete. We\u2019re going to open the call now for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). So, our first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Could you give us a little bit more color on the U.S. kitchen assembly prep tables, maybe how many stores have them currently and I know you said you expected the rollout to be complete by mid-year, but also in addition to the number, since what you\u2019ve learned so far in terms of speed to service or greater product assortment to variety?","Don Thompson","Hi Joe, this is Don. Just a little bit on the prep tables. The high density prep tables and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about relative to the kitchen changes in the U.S. are really, they are key enabler for the future menu and the reason that they are is that they give us a few things we don\u2019t have today. One of those being room to add more ingredients another being [material well] which enables us to include fresh ingredients. It also helps us relative to the way that the kitchens are structured so that we have a mere image of time and it\u2019s on both sides of our preparation table. And we won\u2019t have to ergonomically; you won\u2019t have to reach across the table for our crew to be able to prepare some of our foods, our sandwiches and our products.","These things together really help support our future vision of the menu and that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that we are going to add a lot of things, but what it does means is it gives us the capability to optimize some of the products we have and it gives us the flexibility to have some new toppings that will help us to be able to customize some of the food products that we have. The U.S. is on track to meet its completion goal by mid-year and it\u2019s going quite well.","In addition to that Joe, the other thing that the U.S. is doing now and I mentioned it in my comments is what we call is reset, which is focusing back on staffing and scheduling and positioning. This is really, really critical because at this point in time and with the volumes that we have in the restaurant, we want to make sure that we can handle the peak hour capacities that hit the restaurants.","And so, a combination of those things with the way that we\u2019re rationalizing the menu to make sure we are not implementing too many new products with a better balance of focusing on the core and new products those things all together are really what this major focus in the U.S. is right now and it\u2019s kind of a back to the basics with some enhancements in terms of our productivity and capability in the restaurants.","Operator","","Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer","","Thank you. It just feels like the biggest opportunity here in the near-term is Europe, it\u2019s 40% of profit contribution very similar to the U.S. and your operating profit did decline in the U.S. and APMEA, but it was positive 6% in Europe and I think this was despite your largest European market Germany being negative. And so, just focus on Germany for a second, tell us really what you think is going on that can help turnaround some of those self inflected balloons in that country? And really I just feel if Germany gets turn Europe can really accelerate from here and therefore the profits of the company can really accelerate from here. So, if you could just focus on Germany for a moment that will be helpful?","Don Thompson","","Absolutely Brian, so a couple of things in a broader set. As we talked about the key priority markets and I mentioned some of things that we saw relative to commonalities. And those things really are what I will consider to be a translation of consumer insights into the action plans very strong and making sure that we are not trying to merely drive profitability on the end, but we\u2019re focused on customers and the insights around customers.","There are several things relative to Germany and these things are being addressed now by the leadership team that\u2019s there. One is Germany is a very price sensitive market. And if we look at our performance, we have a couple of main issues; one being our core EVM movement and from a competitive perspective actually the bakeries in Germany are doing quite well.","What customers have mentioned to us is that there is several things that we need to focus on; one is to reestablish our relevance because our menu boards have done a little bit out of whack. What I mean by that we\u2019ve implemented a lot of new products similar to some of the implementations in the U.S. system and it really has confused customers to a certain extent.","The other thing has to do with our pricing and our strategic relationship on the menu board. And this basically is the relationship between the value-based components and the rest of the limited time offers and the core EVMs. We\u2019ve got to make sure that there is a much more rational and strategic pricing structure our teams are working on that. And lastly is the balancing of marketing and that is the balance between our core menu that I\u2019ve talked about with Big Macs, Royales or Quarters, fries, how we leverage and talk about those things along with value along with limited time offers, offers like the (inaudible) products in Germany.","And so, the combination of having a consistent balance there with having a consistent messaging around affordability and also making sure that we reestablished the relevance particularly with the offers we convey via our menu boards and marketing are the things the market\u2019s focused on.","As we were having our session in Germany it\u2019s clear that the new leadership team that we have in place there is focused on these things. We also had a chance to meet with the franchisees in the Germany. They are very understanding of the situation that we\u2019re in there. And frankly one of the things that galvanizes McDonald\u2019s system is when you have poor performance and an impacted cash flow. And I know that our franchisees along with our company team there and it is a new team are all focused on improving the situation there and improving our aggressiveness in the marketplace.","Operator","","Next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Pete when you talked about optimizing the business model little more, can you of the three big buckets you\u2019ve outlined, which do you think is going to have the biggest impact or potentially the biggest impact to shareholder returns? And can you talk about how you plan to convey this information, is it in next quarter or is it inter-quarter and is this the whole plan or is it just kind of an update, we\u2019ll get a lot of these updates along the way?","Pete Bensen","","All right, good question John. I think you have to take -- the three levers that I mentioned, you really have to take those in combination with what Don said in his comments about the focus on the four priority markets. So, taking all of that together is really, the combination of all of that is what\u2019s going to drive the value over the long-term for shareholders and the system, not anyone of those items in isolation.","And as Don mentioned, to turn the sales trends line in those big markets, it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. And so, as we look at what else is there within our business model that in the meantime we can do to be accretive to value, looking at opportunities on the balance sheet as we said though we want to maintain that single A rating that\u2019s been a cornerstone of our business model over the last 50 plus years and is an important piece of our financial strength and flexibility.","Refranchising; at 81% franchised obviously that\u2019s our primary method of doing business. While we\u2019ve done refranchising over the last couple of years, we think there is opportunities to accelerate that. And so, of the financial lever, that's probably the one that has the most opportunity to drive value. And that by its nature is going to be a multi-year plan when we talk about the details. It's going to be a multi-year plan and it's really primarily focused outside the U.S. And, but it's also prudent for us to take a look at our G&A spend especially as we know there are growth opportunities in areas like digital where we want to allocate more funds and rather than have all of that be incremental, we're looking for ways to reallocate so that we can finance those and live within a certain G&A envelope.","So, you can expect to hear from us by the end of the second quarter. And I think what you'd expect to hear is something broadly that covers kind of all of those areas and not just one or two of the specifics.","Operator","Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Great, thanks. Good morning. What are the opportunities you see at breakfast? Have you increasingly focused on a day part as a potential same-store sales driver? It seems like it's been, your attention there has been up to a little bit here recently?","Don Thompson","Thanks Jeff. First of all relative to breakfast, I mentioned in my comments, customers choose breakfast at McDonald\u2019s because our breakfast tastes great. It has very, very high consumer score, freshly prepared products every morning as I mentioned, we actually crack eggs, we cook in our restaurants. This is not a microwave deal, we actually cook. We have grills and fryers and ovens. And so that's the reason that we're able to prepare breakfast.","The other thing is our breakfast model is also focused on how we serve up that breakfast, quickly the customers that are on the go. And so, we continue to focus on those areas of strength that we have. And we have been serving breakfast now for over 30 years and it is our strongest, one of our strongest dayparts clearly, clearly one of the strongest from a profitability perspective, the strongest. And so we will continue to focus on our breakfast opportunities. The U.S. is focused today primarily on breakfast be a coffee and then our handheld sandwiches that we have at breakfast and also on some of the quality and freshness use that I have just talked about.","And so those things will continue to focus on, continue to focus on the operational opportunities we have there in staffing and the scheduling and positioning of breakfast as well.","Operator","Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.","David Tarantino - Baird","Hi, good morning. Just one quick clarification on the last question, then a separate question. First, on the breakfast sort of initiative or focus there; is that being done in response to this competitive activity, for example, the Taco Bell launch and maybe could you comment on whether that is having an impact on your business or not? And then the second question comes back to the focus on the reset initiative in the U.S. And it sounds like maybe some of the initiative there is focused on better handling the complexity, but one of the things that you haven\u2019t talked about is whether you\u2019d be interested in reducing some of the menu complexity to sort of fine-tune the operations and whether or not that\u2019s an opportunity; so perhaps could you comment on that as well? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Thanks David. Just a couple of points, one is there has been breakfast competition for a number of years in the U.S. market. And we\u2019ve had some of our major competitors that may run at breakfast and seems every year there is a someone new that is making a run and none of them have really stopped their focus on breakfast, whether that\u2019d will be the closer end and competitors or if that\u2019s sandwich shops or that\u2019s taco shops or anything else. Everyone has an opportunity and they wanted to look at breakfast.","We have not seen an impact relative to the most recent competitors that entered the space. One of the things that happens at breakfast if anyone enters, customers would try the breakfast that it\u2019s new, it will be something that they have not seen in the marketplace. So we expect customers to try. But what we also are confident in is our ability to execute at breakfast with again the things that I mentioned relative to being a restaurant to cooks and we have a delivery service that\u2019s capable of satisfying the time need if you would of consumers.","I think that new entrants into the market always bring a different level of attention to breakfast which in many cases supports us. Our breakfast continues to be a positive driver in our business in the U.S. And actually sometimes when these entrants come in, it forces us to focus even more on being aggressive relative to breakfast. I know you have just recently seen the coffee execution in the U.S. and our free coffee offers which really are about supporting our breakfast and supporting our breakfast foods as much as they are about reintroducing Americans to a delicious cup of McCafe coffee. So those are the things we do there.","On the reset end, I did mention in my comments a bit about reducing, potentially this reduces the complexity. When you have a number of builds in the restaurant, basically what you are doing is you are leveraging the various condiments and products in the restaurant to build those sandwiches. If you can go to a more streamlined menu board approach and then still have those comments or condiments, so the customers can customize a bit,, it will help in terms of reducing if you will, complexity. Having said that though, customers want very taste. And so we need to be able to deliver that. They also want familiar favorites like the Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, Filet-O-Fish, Nuggets price and we need to be able to deliver on that. And we will be able to do both of those things the system that the U.S. is putting in place on reset just calls us back to a basic operations focus on our restaurant. And it helps us to enable better productivity with some of the things such as the high-density prep table and the high-density kitchen set as we have.","Operator","Next question is from David Palmer from RBC.","David Palmer - RBC","Good morning. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you\u2019re strengthening your planning process to effectively bridge consumer insights with the right customer centric plans and marketing. I am curious about what that means, have we already seen the fruits of these changes in your marketing, are big changes coming soon, perhaps you can give us a sense of what you think is the marketing opportunity after some self diagnosis? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Several different points, thanks David for the question, several points mentioned. On the consumer insights, we have tremendous amounts of data within the McDonald's system. Question is whether the data is then being translated directly to the specific action plans that we see being executed in the marketplace. And that is a combined effort between the franchisees and the market our leadership teams and our supply chain and our supply chain leaders. So we\u2019ve got to make sure that we\u2019re translating those consumer insights.","The whole notion here is that you can\u2019t be driven based upon optimizing profitability, even in the face of external pressures relative to the P&L. We still got to remain grounded in the consumers and that is what we saw at some slight gaps on the priority market. So we\u2019ve got to get back to that consumer focus while mindful of some of these additional cost pressures to make sure that the plans are robust enough. But that is combined with several other things that I mentioned, one is the marketing messages. So if we are more streamlined and focused relative to this consumer insights to action plan, then the marketing focus and the messages won\u2019t be so disbarred. And what we\u2019ll be able to do is focus that strength and highlight that strength a little bit more solidly.","The other thing that we saw was that affordability is one of those things that tends to get a little bit of less focus in tougher times and so in many of the markets, we fell off of our affordability messaging a bit, in some of the markets they are coming back on that. And then the core menu balance, we were chasing a few too many limited time offers. So for these primary focal markets, this is going to take time. I mean our planning process, you know us well, we plan with the franchisees and we plan not just two or three months ahead, we plan six months, nine months and usually a year ahead of time.","So it\u2019s going to take a while to see some of these things layered in. But it is about a series of multiple initiatives, it\u2019s not a silver bullet and these things will take a bit of time. But I feel confident that our markets now are focused on leveraging the right processes, incorporating the right discussion points with the franchisees and moving the business for the long term in the appropriate manner.","Operator","Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Just one around the overall portfolio review, as part of also looking at CapEx and organic growth rate that\u2019s been picking up a little bit the last few years, and I know you guys taking a harder look at whether that\u2019s the right growth rate for the business and the right CapEx spend for the business?","Don Thompson","","Jason, an outcome, so the refranchising plans are being built up market by market. So as we said, we didn\u2019t start this with a particular targeted mind, but we want the markets to come back to us based on their knowledge of franchisees, their local business environment, their growth potential et cetera and come back to us with a more aggressive refranchising plan than they have today. And certainly one of the outcomes of that will be, as we get more franchised that is less capital intensive. So, it will allow us to grow at the same pace, at this pace that we\u2019ve been growing at 2.5% to 3% new units with less capital.","And so, it is definitely an outcome, it\u2019s not the primary objective of looking at the refranchising, but it is certainly an outcome, it makes us a little less capital intensive. But it also makes, it converts that a company operated earning stream into the more stable and predictable rent and royalty franchising income stream which we think is the most valuable piece of all of this.","Operator","Next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens","Yes, thanks guys. Regarding the U.S., can you talk about how you\u2019d gauge the customer reaction so far at the Dollar Menu and More? And how you think you\u2019re positioned there versus your peers to lower end? And at the same time, could you kind of talk about that in the context of necessity there for a dramatic innovation to premium end as a big lever or is it at pressing in the near term at least as driving value and getting people in the door through your value proposition there?","Don Thompson","Okay. I want to make sure, I kissed the last part of that again possibility, Will, but I\u2019ll give this is shot. Relative to Dollar Menu and more, again stepping back relative to value menu in the U.S. during roughly the last 10, 12 year history, the U.S. has evolved the Dollar Menu to ensure the menu offers our liable customer preferences several times. Those changes have been made over this 10 year period to make sure we stay relevant. But we\u2019re also mindful of the profitability aspects and the execution aspects of these menus within the restaurant. And we want to make sure that we provide the right things for our customers and we can do that over a sustained period of time.","So, when we look at Dollar Menu and More, it is another of those evolutions. Dollar Menu and More as a percent of total day sales seems to be relatively in line with our historical averages. And we\u2019re not seeing any dramatic change to the usage of Dollar Menu and More. And so right at this point in time Dollar Menu and More has performed to the expectations that we have had.","I think the last part Will that you have mentioned was relative to, with the relative to premium products and the role that premium products played, I would say is there is a balance between what we just talked about with affordability Dollar Menu and More our core menu offerings and our premium base products.","So when you see Clubhouse Burger in one of the local window -- one of the national windows you will probably see coming up in a local window, it maybe some mentions of breakfast, maybe some mentions of affordability or mentions of a limited time offer product. So Clubhouse Burger work grade nationally which you will also have to marry that along with some of the value messaging, you will also hear some beverage messaging and breakfast messaging.","So that marketing calendar has to accommodate all of those, there is definitely a place for new food and innovation, new beverages and innovation, we just want to be mindful of the core offerings we have giving them the appropriate leverage in the marketing calendar as well as dayparts like breakfast.","Operator","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Buckingham Research.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Thank you. My question is with respect to the price and I wanted to know how that might look with obviously a lot of states having some minimum wage and California going up to increasing their minimum wage over a couple of years here. In your planning process, is that 3% price that you mentioned domestically being held, is that what we will see carried out and already assumes to absorb some of that minimum wage or is there an ongoing dialogue with franchisees as far as what type of minimum wage response they might have?","Pete Bensen","Yeah, Matt. You know there are actually 13 states at the beginning of the year that raised their minimum wage anywhere from $0.10 to a $1. And that\u2019s before any potential federal minimum wage impact. So as I mentioned in my remarks we look at the traditional indices that tend to guide our pricing decision. So food away from home projected to be up 2.5 to 3.5 this year. I think inherent in that is you do see franchisees generally around the industry not just McDonald\u2019s anticipating some of these higher input costs. So they have got what the states have already enacted today. They have got the discussion about a potential at the federal level for a lot of them, the healthcare mandate kicks-in in 2015 so they have to be mindful of that. So these cost pressures are definitely on everyone\u2019s mind as you think pricing, yet as Don mentioned you have to strike that right balance between everyday affordability and providing them premium products that will drive them into the restaurant as well. But as we get too focused on individual profitability and less focused on the customer that\u2019s when we start to run into some of these challenges.","Operator","","Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays","","Great, thank you very much. Just focused on the U.S. business and the competitive environment perhaps obviously ex the weather and I think you have talked about kind of the QSR promotional activity kind of ramping up, I know you mentioned the free coffee promotion; you guys are doing more locally perhaps we have seen kind of buy one get one Big Mac type products. So I am just wondering whether you could talk first and foremost just about the competitive environment specially with you guys having perhaps lowest share to some of your competitors over the past couple of quarters. And as it relates to that, the breakfast which it seems like so far so good that it\u2019s fairly steady at I believe you said roughly 25% of sale I am just wondering if you can give us some insight that we don\u2019t perhaps have on the broader category and maybe how the category is growing relative to how your 25% has grown or contracted over the past year or so? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Thanks Jeff. I will try to answer; I think you got about four or five different questions in there, buddy. But the first one relative to the U.S., U.S. comparable sales trend stabilized during the first quarter of \u201814 and we saw sequential improvement in our reported results comp results, as well as narrowing of the gap to the QSR sandwich competitive set. And excluding the impact of this year\u2019s severe winter weather, our U.S. comparable sales for the first quarter would have been relatively flat. We had about 1.4%, a little over 1.4% impact due to weather, which we don\u2019t often talk about weather because you know next year one it\u2019s much better, we probably won\u2019t talk about it either, but truth of the matter is it did have some level of impact to us, but for you I will put that in the appropriate perspective. We don\u2019t plan around weather at McDonald\u2019s, we plan around customers.","A couple of other things; we continue to see some, the IEO industry in the U.S. is still relatively flat. So, we know that there is going to be a market share battle, so we\u2019ve got to focus on those things that our customers are focused on and desire. So in the U.S. there is a focus around breakfast and coffee as I mentioned, there is focused on balancing our core menu along with some of the limited time offers like you just saw with the Clubhouse Burger and Chicken Sandwich. And we\u2019ve got this basic focus on operations to ensure that we can satisfy the needs of customers particularly during the peak hours.","So that gives you a pretty overall perspective I\u2019d say of our U.S. business and the state of that. From a breakfast perspective, I mentioned it a little bit earlier, our breakfast is strong and it continues to be a solid performer relative to our overall day part segments. And what we want to make sure is that we just continue to focus on the strengths that we have. And actually we have not talked as much about the quality aspects of our breakfast, we haven\u2019t talked as much about the fact that we have restaurant business that cooks. There are entrants into the marketplace that don\u2019t have the same capabilities we have. And so we're going to leverage the strengths that we have and leverage the capabilities we have to inform customers of the fact why we\u2019ve been in the breakfast business for over 30 years and why we have become America\u2019s favorite place to eat breakfast and we don\u2019t plan on giving that up.","Operator","Next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you very much. I just want to follow-up on the U.S. business and in particular in the context of some of the commentary about maybe focusing on profitability, maybe the expenses resonating with customers. So, can you just talk a little bit about the margin structure there? First, is it still the case that you need a 3% comp to lever expenses, should it be higher because it sounds like you are looking more for traffic driven comp? And then I guess what\u2019s the right margin, company-operated over the long-term, if I look back 20, 25 years it\u2019s averaged something close to 18% in U.S. and Europe. Do you see anything that suggest it should go up or down from here or structurally just that is going to change with your margins? Thanks.","Don Thompson","","Hi Sara. I just want to make a quick comment and then I\u2019ll turn this over to Pete on margins. First of all, we have a fantastic group of franchisees in the U.S. business. Matter of fact, next week we have our worldwide [convention] where our franchisees from around the world will be there and we're looking forward to the dialogue and discussions we\u2019ll have.","So when we talk about profitability, what we're talking about is very viable businessman and businesswomen who look at the overall environment and are looking at some of the implications of commodities along with legislative pressures and then they will make decisions relative to their businesses.","So, if we talk about a focus, losing a bit of the focus on the customer, it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t have solid business people or we have people that are trying to squeeze the business, they are looking at the overall perspectives of profitability, which they should do. What we've got to make sure is that our focus relative to profitability starts and ends with a customer focus and those visits to the restaurant and that's why we talk about the balanced plans. So I just wanted to reiterate that fact, I don't think we could have better franchisees, but just like us within the company, we've got to make sure that we all stay focused on the customers.","Pete Bensen","And in terms of the company-operated margins, Sara, we've historically said in a normal environment and we've defined that as being kind of a 2% to 3% inflationary environment. In that kind of normal environment, we need a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins. And our assumption in that is that half of that comp is coming from check and half of that is coming from traffic. And so, what you saw this quarter is we've got a disproportionate share, the comp was negative, while we had over 3% price increase.","So, we had a disproportionate impact of the price increase this quarter is why you saw margins down only 10 basis points. So, we, as Don mentioned in those four priority markets getting the sales and guest count trend lines stabilize and going back positive is what's going to have the most significant impact on our margins.","We've always stayed at the top-line gain and we really need that comparable sales growth and the traffic growth to be able to benefit and leverage that profitability. So that's our focus and really there has been no structural change that would cause us to believe that overtime we can't continue to grow those margins as long as we're generating those positive comps.","Operator","Your next question is from Karen Holthouse from Credit Suisse.","Karen Holthouse - Credit Suisse","Hi. What are the -- in your prepared comments you mentioned there is going to be some increased investments on the digital side in G&A and how does that maybe relate to some of the things we\u2019ve seen in the past about testing for mobile app or what sort of form some of that medium or longer term digital initiatives might add, what sort of form they might take?","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question, Karen. Relative to our overall digital strategy, this is something that we have been looking in many of our markets around the world for some time. However, it\u2019s not been what I would say a systemic strategy where we\u2019ve leveraged the overall strength of McDonald\u2019s.","So, our digital vision is to bring in entirely new level of convenience and fun to the McDonald\u2019s experience. And what we have done to be able to move that forward is identify a couple of areas about opportunity relative to that digital strategy one is the field -- really around experience and the fact that technology can enable us to enhance the customer interactions with our brand and many people would know of that by payment, ordering, redemption type opportunities, as well as customer relationship management.","The second area is an area of engagement; it\u2019s really how we engage customers both with us telling the story of some of the things we mentioned, the quality, messages around McDonald\u2019s, the opportunities within the McDonald\u2019s system, as well as our marketing campaigns and engaging social media to a stronger level.","So, we are going to continue to do that. And from a global strategy perspective it\u2019s really a framework that then allows the local markets to be able to move forward more effectively, will also leverage the strength of McDonald\u2019s system globally relative to our strategic partners as we move forward.","So, we\u2019ve got several markets that are test markets around the world and we are leveraging from the things that they\u2019ve already done. And we are really looking to be able to scale the best ideas we have while those things are then combined with some of the global strategies and strategic partners that we have that are much larger in terms of their scope to help us along on our digital journey.","Operator","","Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JP Morgan.","John Ivankoe - JP Morgan","","Great. Hi, thank you. I think at this point just wanted to tie a couple of things up. Don, I don\u2019t think anyone either within McDonald\u2019s or outside of McDonald\u2019s would have said that you are an organization that was not run without consumer insights over the last two years. In other words, you have always been a consumer insight driven company. So I just wanted to get a sense from your perspective what really will change quantitative, qualitative, what have you over the next couple of years? And maybe with that you mentioned, you have answered to a question in terms of how you plan with franchisees over a 6 or 12 month period in terms of products and promotions what have you. So not necessarily in terms of the cost of G&A but maybe how that G&A is being spent, is there a possibility of changing the way that decisions are made in the speed of which various decision are implemented at a market? In other words, do you need to change kind of your entire decision making process and how things get implemented at the store level as we are clearly in the market that\u2019s moving much faster than it was over the past decade or so?","Don Thompson","","Thanks for the question, John. We will always remain focused on being locally relevant. And that\u2019s the reason we have as you know John some of the market teams out there in the field, and they do a great job. And that is also to help us move quicker. So when it comes to many things at a local level, that\u2019s the way we will continue to operate by leveraging those local teams and the local insights on consumers.","You asked a question about whether or not things have changed relative to consumer insights and data, we have always had data, we\u2019ve always attempted to leverage those insights, as we put forward the plans. The only thing that\u2019s different, and we\u2019ve been through this in cycles is that when you have external pressures, a number of them, sometimes our focus can shift a little bit more to how we ultimately will drive profitability at a restaurant level to handle some of those cost structures, and we lose a little bit of the front-end of those insights. And as a result, we focus more on the margin side of the business than we do on the guest count side of the business. And we know guest counts correlate to our overall results of profitability.","So all we\u2019re saying that\u2019s happening in the markets, now is a refocusing on that front-end of the insights and a refocusing on how those insights need to translate to plans that are customer focused. First, we always will have the profitability aspects in mind as we plan but it\u2019s got to be customer focused first. And all of the markets and our franchisees are well aware of this, but it can happen in cycles and when it does, we just have to make sure we call that out and we go back to the drawing board around how we move this business based on customers.","Operator","And our last question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.","Alex Chan - Jefferies","Hey guys, it\u2019s Alex on for Andy. I want to go back to the European business and ask you a little bit more about Russia and whether or not you saw any impact from the political unrest in the region and how that business is trending and if anything is kind of changed there in terms of the strategy with respect to value and premium products.","Don Thompson","Thanks Alex, Pete and I will kind of double team this one a little bit. First part relative to Russia, one of the things at McDonald's, and we\u2019ve done this in all of the markets around the world. First and foremost will always be the safety of our employees and our guests. That is of the highest level importance to us. There has been no major incidents related to their safety in these current markets whether it\u2019d be Russia or the Ukraine or Crimea or anything has happened in the current situation. Our restaurants generally are operating as normal, some are temporarily adjusting that evening hours based on customer traffic and we have three restaurants in Crimea that have been closed due to suspension of necessary financial and banking services. And so that kind of gives you a state off relative to Russia. There are some financial impacts and currency impacts and I ask Pete to speak to those.","Pete Bensen","","Yes, Alex. During the quarter, the ruble was down about 14% and it was down a little bit more subsequent to the quarter end. And why that\u2019s relevant is Russia imports almost 50% of their food that they use in the restaurants and those imports are denominated, both in euro and U.S. dollar. So when the local currency devalues like that, they have a financial impact. So locally, they had a 200 basis point impact to their margins in Russia from the devaluation that translated into about a 55 basis point impact on total Europe company operated margin solely from the devaluation. So if you assume the ruble is going to stay at this depressed level the rest of the year, that\u2019s something we\u2019re going to be battling with for the rest of the year in our European margins.","That said, Russia has some of the most profitable restaurants around the system, so they are about 10% of our consolidated margins but they are less than 5% of our overall operating income. So in the grand scheme of things to the overall profitability, they are less than 5% but they do impact the margin line somewhat disproportionately because of those imports and because of the high volumes and the high margin they do run.","Operator","Okay. That\u2019s all for Q&A. And I\u2019m going to turn it over to Don for a few final closing thoughts.","Don Thompson","Thanks everyone again. And as we wrap up this morning\u2019s call, I just want to make a couple of comments about where we are positioned as McDonald\u2019s and where I see us? We remain committed to our strategies as we make thoughtful decisions to mitigate some of the short-term pressures and grow this business over the long-term. This has been consistent in terms of our approach, I have even more energy and passion around it today than I did 23 years ago, when I joined the company, because I know that this is a solid leadership team and we\u2019re well aware of what it is we need to accomplish.","I\u2019m confident about our future; we have defensible competitive advantages, some of those we\u2019ve talked about; our resilient model, and the alignment across our owner operators, our suppliers and our company teams to drive enduring profitable growth for our shareholders and our system.","So, I thank all of you for your participation and for your thoughts about McDonald\u2019s and we hope that you have a great day.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Mike Flores","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now I would like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I\u2019m pleased with our first quarter business performance as we continue to build momentum and grow customer visits with delicious food, compelling value, and enhanced convenience. We are managing our business for the long-term and with our Velocity Growth Plan, I am confident that our strategy and actions we\u2019re taking will position the business for sustained growth.","The U.S. market has embarked on an aggressive plan and one of the most significant transformations in our history. Since the start of the year, the market has modernized and improved hospitality in nearly 1,000 restaurants, setting the pace to bring the Experience of the Future to an additional 1,000 restaurants every quarter this year. This is an aggressive pace. 1,000 projects would be like modernizing every McDonald\u2019s restaurant in Australia and we\u2019re doing that each and every quarter in the U.S.","We\u2019ve introduced cooked right when ordered Quarter Pound burgers using fresh beef in thousands of our restaurants and trained hundreds of thousands of restaurant crew on our new procedures along the way. And we\u2019ve transitioned the entire market to a new value platform, offering our customers greater choice and variety. All of this has been accomplished while streamlining our marketing structure. We reduced our advertising co-ops from around 200 to just over 50, allowing us to be more agile in decision making and execution. Also we\u2019re becoming more efficient and effective as we shift to a more natural market approach.","Our International Lead segment once again delivered strong results and they executed foundational elements of our plan in a majority of restaurants. These markets are providing better food, value, and convenience for our customers and capturing more of the potential from their growth initiatives. So what do I mean by this? The markets established a solid foundation that starts with strong local leadership and franchisee alignment and also leverages delicious food at the core of our menu, effective value strategies, rooted in deep consumer insights, and great running restaurants.","These markets then layered in multiple platforms to accelerate and sustain growth with modern and appealing restaurant designs, both inside and out, that signal to our customers we care about our business and care about them. Optimized kitchens have expanded our capacity to serve more customers more quickly in a more productive and enjoyable work environment. Digital menu boards, self-order kiosks, and mobile apps that build awareness of the breadth of our menu and quality of our food. Enhanced drive-thru is helping us quickly serve more of our time-pressed customers whilst creating a culture of hospitality with table service that unlocks the potential of the investments in technology for capacity optimization by creating a low-stress, personalized experience.","It\u2019s the layering of these foundational platforms which has strengthened the brand in these markets whilst building the capacity and capability to drive growth. We\u2019re seeing the results and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so confident in our ability to sustain momentum in these markets and it\u2019s what I look forward to in the rest of our system.","Globally, we marked our 11th consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales with growth of 5.5% in the quarter. Guest counts grew by 0.8%, marking our 5th consecutive quarter of positive global guest count growth. We\u2019ve listened to what our customers are saying by millions of surveys each month and they are telling us that we\u2019re getting noticeably better with fast and friendly service and great-tasting food. Satisfaction scores rose in 2017 and the positive trends continued into 2018.","The most significant improvements were in Japan, France, Australia, and Canada, where in many cases we\u2019re seeing double-digit increases in the key measures of customer satisfaction. With these improving customer perceptions, guest count growth, and market share gains, we are building brand strength which fuels future growth.","Now Kevin will walk you through more details about our sales performance during the quarter.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve. Our comp sales performance for the quarter was strong. Steve and I talk about the size and scale of McDonald\u2019s. To put our 5.5% comp sales increase in perspective, it equates to over $1 billion of growth across the system for the quarter. Each of our operating segments contributed to this growth, with the first quarter also benefiting from a shift in the timing of Easter and related school holidays.","U.S. comp sales increased 2.9% for the quarter, with a positive comp GAAP of 270 basis points versus QSR sandwich competitors excluding McDonald\u2019s. Sales were fueled by higher average check, driven by two primary factors; menu price increases as part of a broader strategic pricing reset of the menu board, and favorable shifts in product mix, consisting of trade-up to new premium products and a higher number of items per order for $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu transactions.","One of our challenges in the U.S. is consistently growing comparable guest counts, especially when current overall industry traffic is negative. U.S. guest counts declined in the first quarter due to the very competitive breakfast day part and our conscious decision to simplify our value platform, eliminating most local value offers. We remain focused on executing our plan to deliver guest count growth through offering the appeal to customers, as well as taking actions to grow our breakfast business.","In the International Lead segment, comp sales were up 7.8% with positive comp sales and guest counts in all markets. Leading the segment, the UK maintained momentum and posted its 48th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. That\u2019s 12 years of uninterrupted quarterly growth in one of our largest and most competitive markets. Germany delivered its best guest count performance since 2005. Drivers of this growth included a fun digital Easter Countdown Calendar promotion and the successful Taste of McDonald\u2019s campaign, featuring products such as the Big Mac and Royal TS Burger. And Canada continued to gain market share across most day parts, supported by continued success of all-day breakfast and premium products such as the Seriously Chicken lineup.","Comp sales for the high-growth markets increased 4.7%, led by continued strong performance in China and Italy. Italy experienced its best quarter in both comp sales and guest counts in the market\u2019s history, driven by digital engagement and the My Selection platform, featuring local ingredients on our premium burgers and chicken sandwiches. And in the Foundational segment, comp sales were up 8.7%. In addition to Japan\u2019s continued strong performance, comp sales were positive in each of the segment\u2019s geographic regions.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, Kevin. Our strong broad-based performance illustrates the traction we\u2019re gaining across the system with our Velocity Growth Plan. This gives us confidence we\u2019ll continue to drive business momentum as we scale what\u2019s working. We have strong market leadership teams which have effectively adapted the plan based on local customer insights, driving greater relevance and impact with the food we serve, the value we offer, and the experience we provide. We are reclaiming leadership and serving great-tasting burgers through product innovation and elevating our core offerings.","This year, around the system, we\u2019re celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Big Mac. We\u2019re reenergizing the brand and rekindling the passion our customers have for this iconic and delicious sandwich. Many markets are extending the line, offering a limited time trio of Mac Jr., the classic Big Mac, and Grand Big Mac. In the UK, this was a key growth driver for the quarter, with Grand Big Mac sales far exceeding any promotional beef sandwich previously offered in the market.","The Quarter Pounder with Cheese is another iconic core burger with tremendous potential. The U.S. is going after this in a big way with the national launch next week of Fresh Beef, cooked right when ordered in our quarter pound burgers. We have already been serving these sandwiches in select markets throughout the U.S. and the response has been very encouraging. In our pilot markets of Dallas, 90% of customers who tried the burgers said they\u2019d buy them again.","These initiatives, on top of the improvements we\u2019ve made to our core chicken products and the scaling of all-day breakfast in Australia and Canada, reinforce the notion that our core menu remains a strong growth driver for our business. Additionally, most markets grew traffic and check with strong premium burger offerings, like Gourmet Creations in Australia and Mighty Angus in Canada.","Across the McDonald\u2019s system, value is foundational to our business and an integral part of our growth plan. Our strategic brand of iconic and relevant value platforms and high-impact deals drove traffic during the quarter. The $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu is the platform that anchors our value strategy in the U.S. With the introduction of this menu at the start of the year, we\u2019re offering customers choice and variety for a simplified menu at multiple price points. It\u2019s performing in line with expectations as customer awareness continues to grow and, as Kevin mentioned, $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu was a key factor in higher average check for the quarter.","In France, the market is providing great taste at a low price with P\u2019Tit Dej\u2019 and complete lunch meals under \u20ac5 with Menu McFirst. With this successful varied approach, McDonald\u2019s France achieved a 6th consecutive quarter of guest count growth and an all-time high per share in the IEO market.","During the quarter, we also drove sales, traffic, and brand excitement with the continued expansion of our velocity accelerators. As we enhance the customer experience and provide greater convenience for our Experience of the Future, delivery, and digital initiatives, we\u2019re learning more about what is most important to our customers and rapidly scaling what works. Table service, which was developed in France, and enhanced hospitality, which was perfected in Canada with their guest experience leader program, have proven to be critical drivers of customer satisfaction. This has helped us unlock the potential of our self-order kiosks to build capacity, frequency, and average check.","We\u2019ve achieved a critical mass of POT at deployment in Australia, Canada, and the UK and are well on our way to being there by year-end in Germany and France. The U.S. remains on pace to have POT at deployment in about half of the market\u2019s 14,000 restaurants by year-end, integrating the best approaches that we\u2019ve learned from the International Lead markets.","Regarding another of our accelerators, more than 11,500 restaurants now offer delivery. Whilst we continue to expand the base of participating restaurants, we\u2019re working closely with Uber Eats and our other partners to optimize the model, building awareness, trial, and more frequent repeat orders, and, most importantly, customer and career satisfaction. In most of our major markets, delivery is already a meaningful contributor to overall comparable sales.","With mobile order and pay now active in over 20,000 restaurants, we\u2019ve turned our focus to building customer awareness, encouraging more app downloads, and driving active usage. One great example of this is Germany. As Kevin previously mentioned, the market had great success as it launched the McDonald\u2019s mobile app with an Easter Countdown Calendar, offering 32 straight days of different and compelling offers only available through the app. This generated over 5 million downloads, making it the most downloaded app in Germany in February, and it drove business results: double-digit comp sales increases and the best guest count growth in 12 years.","The success we\u2019re already seeing across the system reinforces my confidence that we still have significantly more potential in our plan. Our market leadership teams are focused on what works and we\u2019re sourced to execute for impact. Now Kevin will provide additional financial highlight for the quarter.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Steve. As I mentioned earlier, our comp sales growth for the quarter reflects our broad-based strength around the world. Earnings per share for the quarter grew 12% in constant currencies to $1.72. EPS was impacted by $0.07 for some adjustments to amounts we recorded in 2017 as a result of tax reform. Excluding this impact, EPS was $1.79, an increase of 16% in constant currencies. Sales leverage offset the drag of refranchising activity and we saw benefits from a lower tax rate and FX, which I\u2019ll cover in a few minutes.","As we review our operating results, I want to remind everyone that for the first half of this year, we\u2019re comparing against China and Hong Kong results prior to refranchising those markets in the third quarter last year. As we anticipated, we\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of our more heavily franchised business model in our operating margin, as it grew from around 36% in the first quarter last year to nearly 42% this year.","Looking at the components of operating margin, the impact of positive comp sales growth, coupled with refranchising, drove a 60 basis point increase in our franchise margins, which now represent over 80% of margin dollars. Where the most significant refranchising activity in 2017 was developmental license fees, we expect that most of the refranchising this year will be conventional franchising. We also expect that most of this activity will occur in the first half of the year. Looking at 2018 and beyond, we still have a few markets that we\u2019re exploring to potentially refranchise via the developmental license model.","Moving along to company operating margins. Consolidated margins declined 150 basis points to 16% for the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the China\/Hong Kong transaction in 2017 along with wage increases in most of our major markets. In the U.S., company operating margins increased 50 basis points to 15.8%, driven by positive comp sales, a lower advertising contribution rate, and refranchising activity, which helped us overcome higher wage rates and commodity costs this quarter.","Turning to pricing and commodities, our first quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was slightly below food away from home inflation of 2.5%. I mentioned that commodity costs were higher in the U.S. for the quarter. They were up just over 2% versus last year. We continue to expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase about 1% to 2% for the full year, reflecting less commodity pressure in the back half of the year.","Similarly, we expect commodity pressures to ease in the International Lead markets in the back half of 2018. While commodities increased about 3% in the first quarter year-over-year, we continue to expect costs for the full year to increase about 2%. Our menu prices in the International Lead markets were up just over 2% for the quarter.","Continuing on to G&A, G&A for the first quarter was down 1% in constant currencies. We expect our G&A to increase around 5% in the second quarter as a result of costs related to our worldwide convention earlier this month and our corporate headquarters move in May. And we continue to expect our full-year G&A to decrease about 1% in constant currencies.","Our effective tax rate was about 27% for the quarter, reflecting $52 million of adjustments as a result of tax reform that I mentioned earlier. Excluding these adjustments, the tax rate was around 24.5%. While we may have additional adjustments this year as the guidance on tax reform continues to evolve, we still expect our full-year tax rate to be in the 25% to 27% range.","Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation benefited EPS by $0.08 per share. At current rates, we anticipate a slightly lower benefit from foreign currency for the second quarter and about $0.19 to $0.21 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the remainder of the year.","Our broad-based strength is a reflection of the power of our Velocity Growth Plan and we\u2019re confident that the actions we\u2019re taking will continue to drive growth, both for today and the long-term. And now I\u2019ll turn it back to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","During the quarter, we made a series of announcements intended to help us maintain and build trust with our customers. With our Scale for Good framework, we are elevating a select group of global priorities where we believe we can make the greatest difference and drive industry-wide change. McDonald\u2019s is stepping up to address major social and environmental issues that matter most to our customers, franchisees, employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders.","Scale for Good is not a separate corporate responsibility platform, but rather an initiative embedded in our growth strategy. We\u2019ve set goals to reduce packaging and increase recycling, take bold actions related to kids\u2019 nutrition, and support producers in developing more sustainable approaches to raising beef. McDonald\u2019s is the first global restaurant company to address climate change by setting a real target to significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions.","And we\u2019re expanding on our longtime commitment to restaurant crew and managers. Last month we announced that we will increase our investment up to $150 million over five years to our global Archways to Opportunity education program. With Scale for Good, our goals extend beyond our direct reach. With initiatives such as beef sustainability and operating more energy-efficient restaurants and offices, we\u2019re working across our supply chain and collaborating with thousands of franchisees, suppliers, and producers.","Whether it\u2019s with Scale for Good or other partnerships, McDonald\u2019s possesses a convening power like no other company in our sector. A prime example is the announcement during the quarter of a new alliance between McDonald\u2019s and the Walt Disney Company. Building on our goal to offer more nutritionally balanced Happy Meals, Disney and McDonald\u2019s will collaborate with cross-promotional campaigns involving movies from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studies, Disney Live Action, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm. This alliance combines two of the most iconic and beloved brands for families and we\u2019re excited by the fun and innovative opportunities it will create for engaging with customers.","Over the past couple of years, you\u2019ve heard us talk about our higher appetite for calculated risk, greater personal accountability, and growing ambition. We\u2019re asking a lot of everybody in the McDonald\u2019s system. As is certainly the case in the U.S., where we\u2019ve developed an ambitious plan over the past year with our franchisees. It\u2019s going to be hard work and we\u2019re taking on a lot at once. This is what it takes to keep pace with today\u2019s rising customer expectations. The McDonald\u2019s system is up for the challenge, we\u2019re fit for purpose, and we\u2019ll continue to get better.","We\u2019ve seen the results when our other markets have executed strong plans and we\u2019re confident about the U.S. Let me tell you why. Franchisees, suppliers, and corporate staff are energized and enthusiastic about our future. As I talked with many of them recently at our worldwide convention in Orlando, Florida, I was struck by their deep sense of commitment to our customers and robust determination to maintain our momentum. The convention was an occasion for the entire McDonald\u2019s system to reflect on the progress of our business over the past two years and a large amount of the strategy guiding our future. The 15,000 people attending our convention were eager to share and learn the best approaches in our top-performing markets and restaurants.","We have one of the world\u2019s most powerful brands and with the Velocity Growth Plan, confidence is growing throughout the McDonald\u2019s system that we can make it even stronger. We\u2019re ambitious and hungry to unlock even greater potential remaining in our plan. As we look to maintain this pace in the quarters ahead, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re on track to strengthen our leadership position. The McDonald\u2019s system is fully aligned and engaged, from the crew members in our restaurants to our franchisees to our suppliers and corporate staff, we are committed to showing our customers every day how we\u2019re becoming a better McDonald\u2019s.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike to lead Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mike Flores","Thank you, Steve. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] And now the first question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","Thank you very much. Just on the U.S. comp, if I may, you pointed out that traffic is a priority. There was some softness in the breakfast day part. And also just in terms of the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, since it\u2019s driving average check, it sounds like maybe it\u2019s adding to existing customer orders but maybe not bringing in new customers. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk about the tweaks you might be making. Is it on the value side? And, if not, in terms of breakfast, where do you think you\u2019re losing the customers? Is it to kind of coffee shops? Is it to other QSRs? Just trying to understand the complexion of the U.S. comp.","Steve Easterbrook","Sure. I\u2019ll start, Sara. I think the reality is footfall is down. So I\u2019m not sitting here thinking that there\u2019s share going to any particular competitor. It\u2019s just a market share fight overall. So as you say, we\u2019re going to continue to sharpen our plans. And if you want to talk about, for example, the value platform, this is the most significant value platform launch we\u2019ve had in probably more than ten years. So it takes a while for the customers to get familiar with the new menu.","And we\u2019ve got three or four items each at $1, $2, and $3. And, yes, we\u2019re getting a better understanding now of how customers are buying from that menu. And as we\u2019ve seen, we know it can build average check, so we\u2019re selling more items per order than we were previously. But we\u2019re also still very keen just to get that single dollar customer come in at the real value end as well.","So I think you\u2019ll just see us continuing to make sure that we can highlight the range we have. But actually we\u2019ve got some absolute knock-out products on our $1 and $2, like our $3 Happy Meal, for example. So I think we\u2019ll keep finessing it. There is flexibility there. We\u2019re changing media weights. We\u2019re changing some of the creative work as well on the marketing side, to better have some of the stronger items just pop out a little bit more from a customer perspective. But we\u2019re satisfied with where we\u2019re at. Although we don\u2019t want to get the guest count piece moving again and we\u2019ve never made any secret of that.","Mike Flores","Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Great. Thanks. Two parts to my question. Just a follow-up on the first question. What\u2019s the diagnosis behind the soft morning sales and did the two for $4 Breakfast promo meet your expectations given the backdrop of softening morning day part?","And then I know you\u2019re not prepared to discuss the lift you experienced from Hot off the Grill, the fresh beef initiative in the test markets, but from a timing perspective, did this initiative lead to a faster lift in sales in test markets relative to what you saw with the $1, $2, $3 rollout earlier this year? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","So the two for $4 Breakfast meal was \u2013 the first thing I want to do is highlight something that really encourages me, which is how nimble the U.S. system now is. We have sometimes been a little bit slow to be able to effect change and the guys could see where the market was going. Breakfast was competitive. With the owner\/operators, they created a device, the two for $4 deal. And we\u2019re satisfied. We think that makes us much more competitive in the breakfast day part so I can see continued enthusiasm for that.","For fresh beef, we really have not put any advertising weight behind it yet. So in the test markets, what we were getting more of was the understanding of the operational consequences, so we could best train our people, and certainly the customer feedback at a restaurant level was absolutely fantastic. So we haven\u2019t attempted to drive sales with it yet so we haven\u2019t put the marketing dollars behind it. But that\u2019s going to change soon now that we\u2019ve rolled this out across the entire state. We\u2019re ready to go. And if you haven\u2019t tried it, you\u2019ve got to try it. It just tastes great. Honestly, it\u2019s a hotter and juicier Quarter Pounder and customers are really enthused about the noticeable difference it makes.","Kevin Ozan","Hey, Andrew, the only other thing I\u2019d say is, just as perspective that two for $4 breakfast that you talked about didn\u2019t go in until mid-March. And so it really didn\u2019t have a meaningful impact on first quarter results. It\u2019ll really have more of an impact related to second quarter.","Mike Flores","Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JP Morgan.","John Ivankoe","Hi. Great. Thank you. First, how much was the calendar shift a benefit, I think particularly to International Lead, which is where I would suspect it would be the highest? And then secondly, for the main question, what can we learn from International Lead in terms of various initiatives that that collection of markets may be ahead of the U.S. that could be a leading indicator to future U.S. sales and comp performance? If you could just highlight a couple and where we are in terms of rollout for International Lead versus U.S.","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I\u2019ll start with the calendar shift and then Steve can talk about learnings from the IL. It\u2019s actually different by market. Certainly Europe had a bigger impact than places like the U.S. Germany, for example, has one of the bigger impacts, more related to school holidays actually than the Easter timing, but they obviously are correlated. So it was certainly a benefit in the first quarter and we\u2019ll see that benefit, if you will, reverse in the second quarter.","Steve Easterbrook","John, I\u2019ll take the second one. Because you\u2019re absolutely right. I think what\u2019s really created the confidence to put such a bold plan together for our U.S. business has been what they\u2019ve seen and what we\u2019ve all seen with the International Lead markets. So one of the benefits we do have here now is, as we are rolling out thousands of projects per quarter \u2013 so, I mean, it really is a phenomenal project management exercise and change management exercise. We have so much learning now from Australia, Canada, and UK, in particular, the most advanced, the sort of details that we can get into and share now, which helped the U.S. from a learning perspective. Things like the real nitty-gritty stuff.","So with the self-order kiosks, what\u2019s really important about the self-order kiosk is not just the customer-facing user interface but actually physically where you position them in a restaurant, for example. So you can better understand customer flow. It provides another ordering option for a customer apart from the front counter. So the devil is in the detail, as you expand as rapidly as we do and we\u2019re investing as much as we are. But things like training programs. Understanding the best way we can train both kitchen crew and also front of house and the hospitality. So part of what we have committed to, to our U.S. business, is we will literally just pick up and share the best practices.","And we still think there\u2019s more the International Lead markets can get out of some of the initiatives of Experience of the Future. So we\u2019re going to continue to really squeeze it hard and get as much out of it as we can. But I think what gives us confidence is the U.S. doesn\u2019t need to make any of the mistakes that we made in some of the early days as we\u2019re learning some of these initiatives. We have a proven model now and we can just get into that groove of 1,000 projects a quarter and we\u2019re excited about what it\u2019s going to do for the business.","Mike Flores","Next is David Palmer, RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning and congratulations on that phenomenal momentum in your leadership markets. Perhaps you can make a highlight on the UK market, why that one is so particularly strong. We\u2019ve heard about such tough weather conditions there. I would imagine that you\u2019re outperforming the eating-out market there, particularly by a wide margin. But a separate question on the $1, $2, $3, I\u2019m just trying to understand where you\u2019re coming from on this one.","You said it\u2019s performing in line with expectations but that traffic was negative in the quarter. Are you going to probably keep the architecture the same on the $1, $2, $3 going forward, confident that it will build in momentum and acceptance with the help of some of the premium innovation that you have coming? Or do you think that this is something that you\u2019ll continue to tweak along the way? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Thanks, David. So, the UK, they\u2019re on a real roll. And we do call them out from time to time because they\u2019ve really gathered some fantastic momentum. I think ultimately what they\u2019re benefiting from is not just the motivated owner\/operators and the investments we bring into our restaurants, but actually for many years, they have really been very good at putting attention to building the brand as well. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace. It\u2019s facing many of the societal challenges and business challenges that we face elsewhere in the world.","But they really are beginning to reap the benefits of long-term sustained investment in the brand, as well as just in the core business. And, yes, they\u2019re taking plenty of market share. They\u2019re in a very dominant position and I think it would be tough to be a competitor of McDonald\u2019s in the UK. They really are firing on all cylinders which is great.","For the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, I think the architecture, you could expect to see it pretty much the same. Yes. As I say, we\u2019re understanding more about how customers are buying from it and what they see. Could we rotate one or two items on and off it? Yes, absolutely, that was always part of the plan so we can always keep it fresh and have got something new to talk about. But fundamentally we\u2019re satisfied with where it is. Overall, we\u2019re not satisfied with guest counts being down. But the role the Dollar Menu plays and the way it \u2013 the influence it has on our overall product mix is where we want a value platform to be.","Mike Flores","Next is Brian Bittner, Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just with fresh beef in the U.S., surely it must provide a tremendous perception with the quality of your Quarter Pounders. But the question I have is, is there any risk that it puts a shadow on the rest of your beef menu at all? Or are you just simply not seeing this anywhere where you\u2019ve tested it?","Steve Easterbrook","Brian, it\u2019s a good question. It was actually one of the things we were very mindful of when we actually established the test in the first place. And we wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t any other sort of, as you say, shadow or reflection on the rest of the menu. But customers really did not create any concern for us whatsoever in the way that they interpreted what we are doing. They were just saying if you could help make the Quarter Pounder taste even better, good for you. You\u2019ve got our backs. So we didn\u2019t see anything to cause us any concern. That\u2019s why we did have a robust test. I mean, we\u2019ve been testing this for about 12 to 18 months so we\u2019ve got a really good read from a customer basis now. And they\u2019re just saying good on you. If you can just make this taste better then bring it on.","Kevin Ozan","And what we actually saw in our test markets was sales of Quarter Pound burgers went up but also sales of our overall burger lineup increased. So even the burgers that weren\u2019t using fresh beef in our test markets of Tulsa and Dallas saw an increase during the pilot test phase.","Mike Flores","Next up is David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Just one clarification on the U.S. comp for Q1 and then a question on mobile ordering. So the first, a clarification, I know you don\u2019t like calling out weather issues but the winter was pretty tough in the U.S. So did weather impact the Q1 comp and, if so, do you have an estimate for that? And then secondly, on mobile ordering, I was just wondering, Steve, if you could give us an update on the adoption rate you\u2019re seeing in the U.S. It seems fairly modest from my view so far but I guess where are you on that and what\u2019s the plan to drive better adoption given that could be a pretty big unlock for throughput? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I\u2019ll start with weather and then Steve can take the digital stuff. You\u2019re right. We generally don\u2019t like to call out specifically weather. It did negatively impact first quarter. I guess I\u2019d say maybe a little over a half a point would be approximate quantitatively. But we\u2019re generally not big plans of calling plus or minus the weather. But it certainly impacted us here. And surprisingly it actually had an impact in Europe, too, because Europe, for those of you who follow, had some rough weather during the first quarter also. But that\u2019s kind of quantitatively about how much it impacted us.","Steve Easterbrook","We\u2019ve had a couple of relatively gentle winters prior to this as well. So I think this was just a little bit more of a typical weather pattern across it so we\u2019ve just got to get on with it. It\u2019s just the way it is.","So for mobile ordering, current adoption is pretty low actually, David. So the platform is getting more reliable. We\u2019ve still got things we\u2019re trying to improve on our end, from the user experience perspective and training our teams in the restaurants and just getting the technology more reliable. But the adoption is still relatively low. We\u2019re certainly seeing the curbside pick-up being the most favored benefit that customers are seeing from it.","But we\u2019ll continue to work away on it. It\u2019s not anything that we\u2019re going to put a massive emphasis behind, in terms of anything promotional, for example. However I think it\u2019s pretty inevitable that our customers will increasingly engage with us as a brand and as a business through their phones. So the fact that we\u2019ve got a product out there that\u2019s decent at the moment, I think there\u2019s a lot of upside. And we\u2019re excited about the potential but, at the moment, we\u2019re not seeing it drive significant business for us.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. Just a bookkeeping question and then a question on delivery. Did you guys specify how much that is in the U.S.? And then just looking at the U.S. store margins from the company side, I wonder is that a good trend to follow, as far as if you wanted to look at what the franchisees are experiencing, as far as the margin fall off in the U.S. stores? Or is that just more of a difference in mix? Because it sounds like the value menu that you\u2019re launching would be favorable. Given what it\u2019s done to the check and other methods through the income statement, if that would be favorable to the franchise margins?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I\u2019ll take this. We won\u2019t quantify exactly what delivery \u2013 I\u2019d say delivery certainly contributed to the U.S. comp in the first quarter, as it did at the end of the year last year. We would hope and expect that to continue to grow as sales grow on the delivery side. So it\u2019s a meaningful contributor to the comp.","On margins, a couple things relate to the U.S. margins. One, and you just mentioned this, but most of the comp or effectively all of the comp is really driven by check, which by definition brings with it then a positive impact on the margin side, because you get a bigger flow through, certainly from price than on the guest counts. Although that\u2019s not the way we\u2019d want it to work long-term. So the fact that check is driving comps is helping margins. That would also be helping the franchisees margins. The lower advertising contribution rate that we mentioned, that would be helping both us and the franchisees also.","One of the things that helped us specifically was some refranchising that we\u2019ve done, really over the last year in the U.S., where we sold some underperforming restaurants, as the franchisees can generally run those better than we can. Obviously that piece wouldn\u2019t add to the franchisees margin. And then the other piece certainly is labor wages that are impacting both of us. So, in general, most of the benefit that we saw in margins would also be helping them. Again, other than the refranchising benefit which, to us, was a significant benefit that they wouldn\u2019t realize.","Mike Flores","Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. My question is on the Experience of the Future. And Steve, you mentioned you\u2019re accelerating the rollout of it in the U.S. So, first of all, is there a risk or did it impact at all same store sales in the first quarter, as either restaurants are closed or maybe crews are somehow distracted? Can you maybe talk about how you frame that potential impact to the business on the short-term? On the long-term, it seems like, if you\u2019re doing about 4,000 units this year and maybe therefore another 4,000 units next year, you might be able to get this done faster than you thought. Is this an acceleration, I guess, is the question versus the prior pace or is this just about where you thought it would be?","Steve Easterbrook","No, we have upped the pace a little bit, John. I think we spoke about it actually over the last \u2013 earlier quarters as well. I think with some of the benefit we have seen from tax reform, it enabled us to, if you like, frontload the project and we\u2019ve got our orders lined up so we expect to make significant headway in basically the next two years, 2018 and 2019. And we will have a substantial amount of the estate complete by then.","In terms of the impact, yes, it does hold back the like-for-like sales a little bit because we\u2019ve got 1,000 projects. And it depends how long the \u2013 depending on how the restaurant currently looks does dictate how long the project lasts. And it\u2019s one of those \u2013 I should really have mentioned that earlier. One of the benefits we\u2019re seeing from the International Lead markets is we\u2019re getting pretty good about scheduling these restaurants so you can minimize the downtime. So you can get the maximum effect for the customer, minimize the downtime. But the restaurants can be shut for 10 days to 14 days for some of the more significant investment.","So, yes, that does slow us a little bit on the like-for-like. It\u2019ll be fine once we start to get into the routine year-on-year because we\u2019ll be doing another 1,000 next quarter, another 1,000 first quarter of 2019. But this current year, it will hold us back on the comp side a little bit, yes. But as I say, we\u2019re playing the long game. We know what the upside can be. It\u2019s a small price to pay for the benefit we believe the business will have.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh","Yes, thank you. I wanted to ask on average check, globally and in the U.S. as well, and just your comfort level with what looked like globally, I think, a 4.7% increase. And I realize there are a lot of moving pieces across the globe in that number, considering the pricing rebasing that you\u2019ve done, but could you generally just talk about your comfort level with running an increase in check of that size? And is there any sort of longer-term check growth goal that we could think about for the business, either in the U.S. or globally?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I\u2019ll take that. Some of that is U.S. obviously and some of that\u2019s outside the U.S. Our general goal is to optimize menu prices across all our price tiers within a market. And we look at various factors within each market, including things like food inflation or food away from home, other cost pressures, whether that\u2019s labor or any other costs. The biggest thing is kind of what customers will accept based on that market, based on competition. And so it\u2019s really an attempt to balance guest count growth and average check growth. And like I talked about in the U.S. right now, we\u2019re a little bit more skewed on the average check side versus guest count than we would want. So we\u2019d like to make sure that we get the guest count growth. But, in general, we generally try and stay a little bit below food inflation as kind of an overall guide.","Steve Easterbrook","Just to add another perspective to what Kevin\u2019s just said. What we\u2019re seeing, particularly once we\u2019ve made the investments in the Experience of the Future, clearly a number of those are customer-facing, but what we\u2019re also doing is adding some firepower to the kitchen as well, which means we can offer a different range and particularly at the Signature end of the business. So part of what we\u2019re seeing is, with a better invested restaurant, great hospitality, we\u2019re launching premium ranges more consistently across our lead markets and that\u2019s also driving average check as well. So there\u2019s a product mix piece. But it\u2019s the permissibility we get on price is \u2013 if you run a great restaurant, it looks great, and it\u2019s welcoming, great hospitality and table service, then people are willing to pay a little more as well. So I think we\u2019ve got a bit of that helping.","Kevin Ozan","And then the one other newer aspect, I\u2019ll say, over the last year or so would be delivery. Delivery check size is generally one and half to two times kind of our regular in-store check. So that\u2019s also helping drive average check up, kind of on a global basis.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Peter Saleh with BTIG.","Peter Saleh","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to come back to the conversation around the Experience of the Future. I think historically you had discussed a mid-single digit sales lift in the first year. But now that you have a critical mass of restaurants, both domestically and internationally, can you talk about the comp performance and the margin performance in year two and beyond?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I can start on that. Certainly in the U.S., we wouldn\u2019t have year two and beyond. But internationally, what we\u2019ve seen historically that we\u2019ve talked about is generally mid-single digit sales lifts for restaurants that convert to the Experience of the Future when you compare it to the rest of the market that maybe hadn\u2019t put it in yet. And most of those markets also see continued comp growth in year two after that. So it\u2019s not a one-time benefit but kind of builds on itself.","In the U.S., it\u2019s obviously much earlier days right now so we don\u2019t certainly have the year two. But even in the early days, right now what we\u2019re seeing is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen internationally, which is kind of that mid-single digit sales lift for the projects where we have full modernization, where we do a full remodel and add in all the EOTF components, if you will. The projects that have already been modernized and only add in the EOTF components, that\u2019s a smaller lift, more around 1%. But the ones where we have full modernization and EOTF, it\u2019s similar to what we\u2019ve seen internationally, which is that mid-single digit lift.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. Just maybe a two-part question on the refranchising and the ultimate worldwide operating margin that you referred to in your prepared remarks. On the refranchising side, it looks like you had close to $100 million in gains in the first quarter and it hasn\u2019t been that far off from that number in most of the quarters in 2017. So I\u2019m just wondering whether we should assume these type of gains continue or are we now in the very late innings of the refranchising and therefore the gains should moderate?","And the related part is just as that impacts the broader operating margin. I think you mentioned your operating margin is right now at 42%, which was up 600 basis points, and that was in the first quarter. Presumably that\u2019s led by the refranchising but I\u2019m just wondering where you think that ultimately settles as you wrap up refranchising and what type of growth rate we\u2019d assume once the refranchising is done off of that. Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Yes, thanks, Jeff. I think I mentioned in my remarks that we\u2019ll have more conventional \u2013 more of our refranchising in 2018 will be the conventional type versus a lot of the developmental license that we had certainly last year. And I also mentioned that most of that activity will happen in the first half of the year. So to your point, we had about $100 million of gains in the first quarter. I would expect relatively similar, maybe a little bit less, in the second quarter. And then it\u2019ll start easing off a little bit in the third and fourth because most of the activity this year is in that first half of the year.","By the time we get to the full-year, it\u2019ll be a little bit \u2013 we expect it to be a little bit lower than what we would have seen last year. So I think earlier, in the last quarter, we said about $30 million to $40 million less. We\u2019re actually seeing gains on each transaction a little bit higher so it may turn out to only be $20 million less than last year. But it should be a little bit less than last year. And then it will kind of ratchet down more than that next year then.","Sorry, then the operating margin. So what you are seeing in operating margin, a couple things. You\u2019re seeing the benefit of refranchising as we certainly converted China\/Hong Kong last year in the big transactions. When we refranchised that, certainly it benefits operating margin. And then you\u2019re also starting to see the benefits of G&A management and the rest of our P&L. We\u2019ve talked about our long-term goal beginning in 2019 of being in the mid-40s on operating margin and in our mind we\u2019re still on track for that.","Steve Easterbrook","I think the only thing I would add to Kevin\u2019s comments was, given the way that we\u2019ve restructured ourselves as a business now, with our International Leads markets, with the high growth, those are typically the markets that our company owns still. We actually have, literally restaurant by restaurant, we have a very clear understanding of our franchising plans, who would we be selling to and which restaurants we want to keep and operate ourselves as well because that\u2019s an important piece for us. So we really have got a very granular look now and we can drill down country by country to have a very, very clear and, I guess, strategic franchising plan looking forward now.","Mike Flores","Next question is from Greg Francfort with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","Hey, guys, two questions. Just one is on the macro backdrop in the European markets and can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and then maybe how sustainable you think that is. And then my second question is on the U.S. marketing side. Can you talk about your marketing weight during the quarter, whether or not you pulled forward any spending around the $1, $2, $3 and whether or not \u2013 we\u2019re hearing, I think, that the industry margin weights are up pretty substantially. How sustainable do you think that is? I know there\u2019s a lot there.","Kevin Ozan","There is a lot there. So what we\u2019re seeing Europe. I mean, typically we do want to look at mainland Europe, where we\u2019ve got clearly France, Germany, two very important markets for us. We\u2019re getting some really good momentum out of some of the mid-size markets, kind of the 500 restaurant style markets, like Italy and Spain. The Netherlands is growing strong. Typically we\u2019re not seeing any particular headwinds but nor are we getting any great tailwinds.","There seems to be a little bit of calm has entered the markets after the kind of shock from the Brexit decision maybe a couple of years back. But it doesn\u2019t appear to be quite as disruptive as perhaps people feared. We are seeing differences in labor movements. There\u2019s less migration going on across Europe and we see that here in the U.S. as well. So there are some dynamics we\u2019ve got to pace into but, as a business environment, I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly calm and our success is really just because of what we\u2019re choosing to do and we\u2019re being aggressive in each of those markets.","In terms of our \u2013 yes, we did shift some of the media weight. The quarter was a lot more than just $1, $2, $3 here in the U.S. But, yes, we wanted to make sure that we \u2013 we wanted to get the awareness of the items, the awareness of the menu at really good levels quickly. Customer awareness of what the items actually on the Dollar Menu wasn\u2019t quite what we wanted so we did shift the emphasis a little bit on that. But I think there was a lot of competitive spend in the quarter as well. So I think we feel pretty good that we battled through a tough quarter. We\u2019ve certainly got plenty of gunpowder we can throw out as well and, if the others have struggled over their spend, then I guess that\u2019ll be something they\u2019ll deal with.","Mike Flores","Next is Alton Stump with Longbow.","Alton Stump","Good morning or good afternoon. Congrats on the result. I guess just a question. It isn\u2019t difficult, of course, to get a higher ticket when you roll out new value platforms. So can you just kind of walk through what is driving that? I presume that means that the $3 bucket items are selling well or is there anything else going on there that is driving the higher ticket off $1, $2, $3?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, I can start talking about that. A couple of things. So we\u2019re seeing people use the $1, $2, $3 Menu in a variety of ways. Some people will create a meal using some items from the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu. Some people will buy a combo meal that isn\u2019t on $1, $2, $3 then add an item from the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu as an add-on. So we\u2019re seeing people use the $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu in various ways. And one of the things we\u2019re seeing is that the items \u2013 when people use $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu, the items per transaction in those transactions is higher than our average when people don\u2019t use that $1, $2, $3 Dollar Menu.","That is helping drive average check for those transactions. And so that\u2019s, in general, what we\u2019re seeing. And as Steve talked about earlier, we like the construct of that menu. And so it allows people to use it in various ways. And, again, we need to make sure people are aware of all the specific items in the menu, but general awareness of the menu is pretty good.","Steve Easterbrook","And clearly we\u2019ve stayed pretty close to customers when you launch something like this. We\u2019re getting high satisfaction and value perception scores as well from the Dollar Menu, which is obviously important to us. So, yes, above average checks run a little higher is clearly helping support the business. But from a value perception point of view, customers are feeling good about it and are playing that back to us.","Mike Flores","And our next question is from Nicole Miller Regan with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thank you. Good morning. My question is around commodities. So what pieces are, in the U.S., inflating that cogs basket up closer to 2% to 3%? And if that persists, will you address value differently? And was that any contributing factor to removing some of those local value deals that you talked about earlier? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Yes. Most of the increases for 2018 that we expect are in the main categories that you would expect: beef and chicken, primarily. Right now, those increases aren\u2019t enough that it would change any of our marketing plans or product plans or anything along those lines. Like I mentioned, the first quarter was probably \u2013 right now, it looks like the first quarter increase would be the highest increase in the U.S. that we\u2019d see for the year. So we anticipate that increase kind of dissipating as the year goes on. But it isn\u2019t to a level where it\u2019s driving any change in marketing or product plans for the year.","Mike Flores","Our next question is from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer","Thanks. Just following up on the U.S. restaurant level margin, does that 1Q margin fully reflect the cost headwinds from I guess both the wage rate inflation and your investments in labor? Or will those headwinds further build out into 2Q and the back half of the year?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, thanks for the question, Jeff. It does reflect certainly the wage rate, the cost, I\u2019ll say. What we have started seeing, to be fair, is that some of that labor initiative investment is starting to dissipate a little bit. Some of that related to training as we got ready for the fresh beef rollout and so now that we\u2019re kind of coming upon that, we\u2019re seeing some of that labor training investment starting to dissipate. So it\u2019s fair to expect that that will continue \u2013 that piece will continue to dissipate as the year goes on.","Steve Easterbrook","And I think the other piece to add as well, this is kind of a shout out to the operations guys out there, is working really hard to minimize crew turnover as well. So we\u2019ve got the 90-day turnover down to a really good level at the moment because that\u2019s where hidden costs can sometimes come in if turnover gets out of hand a little bit. So the guys in the field, while there\u2019s a lot of change in the restaurants, we\u2019re working really hard with the investments we\u2019re making both on the pay side but also the training and education side for our crew and managers, and we\u2019re beginning to see that with the turnover being well managed as well.","Mike Flores","We\u2019ve got time for one last question and that will be Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy","Great, thank you. If we can revisit Greg\u2019s question on the competitive landscape in Europe and if you can share a little bit more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of IEO growth and competitors\u2019 rational or irrational behavior. In other words, how much of what we\u2019re seeing from McDonald\u2019s successes are coming solely from what you\u2019re doing and how much of it might also be a little bit of a tailwind? Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Yes. I\u2019ll start and Steven can chime in. What we\u2019re actually seeing in most of the international markets is that we\u2019re gaining market share. And just about all of those are big, major markets, I\u2019ll say. Competitive landscape certainly varies by market. Some of the markets are a little bit more competitive than others. I\u2019d say overall IEO market in most of those countries is relatively muted. You\u2019re not seeing gang busting growth in any of those countries. So it\u2019s relatively muted which makes it competitive to have to gain market share. And in most of those we are seeing improvements in our market share.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, I think the only thing I would add is, if there is any growth in the sector at all, it\u2019s typically on new units. And we have been a little bit more modest on new additions because we prioritized the reinvestment in the existing estate. But I think really that it\u2019s a zero sum game. It is literally a market share fight, I think, in all of our major markets. There is no one market, whether it\u2019s Australia, Canada, UK, Italy, Spain, none of those markets have macro tailwinds that\u2019s helping us lift. We\u2019re just literally scrapping hard, working hard, and taking share. So I think our gain is typically someone else\u2019s pain.","Mike Flores","Well, we\u2019ve reached the top of the hour so that concludes our call. I want to thank everyone for your great questions and we\u2019ll sign off.","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you.","Kevin Ozan","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation Investor Conference Call.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin","Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton is here Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast and podcast.","And before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at our website www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as a reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to begin by briefly framing our performance using three lenses. The past, the present, and the future.","First the past, because it provides perspective and guides our present and future. Throughout McDonald\u2019s history, we respectively grown both the top and the bottom lines to varying degrees across a variety of economic and competitive cycles. We have an iconic brand an outstanding system of owner-operators, suppliers and employees and superb real estate locations in nearly every market around the world. This provides a solid foundation from which we operate.","Second, the present. In second quarter we grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, despite the ongoing impact of the challenging environment. This is truly a testament to the fortitude and resilience of our system, our sustainable competitive advantages, and the collective focus on execution at our restaurants.","And third the future. We expect the dynamics of this cycle should persist in the near-term, namely flat to declining informal eating out markets, increasingly less ability to take price, cost pressures throughout our P&L and heightened competitive activity.","Our second quarter results tells story consistent with these lenses. Global comparable sales were up 1%, operating income was up 3% and constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.38, a 6% increase in constant currencies. And as we begin the third quarter, global comparable sales are expected to be relatively flat in July. Based on our recent sales trends, our results for the rest of the year are expected to remain challenged.","We remain committed to the plan to winning our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and to broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s around the world. This customer centric plan enables us to deliver an appealing experience by offering great tasting, affordable food and beverages, and clean and modern restaurants.","At the same time, we are diligently implementing thoughtful adjustments to our proven strategies and solutions when and where needed. This flexibility has enabled us to maintain or grow market share in most of our major markets around the world.","Let's review ours results in every geographic business units, starting with the United States, where comparable sales for the quarter were up 1% and operating income was flat. We continue to appeal to our customers with an increased emphasis on new news across our menu, and an ongoing focus on everyday affordable value.","The Dollar Menu remains a foundational component of our strategy to consistently deliver value across the menu, rather than implementing aggressive short-term discounting tactics. At the same time, our focus on enhancing core classics and offering additional premium products, continues to provide customers with even more variety and choices across day parts and price points.","This quarter we introduce new items across all four key growth categories, chicken, beef, breakfast and beverages. Premium McWraps launched in April, the Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie and Egg White Delight debuted in May and last month we added fresh new taste to our Quarter Pounder Burgers with three new flavorful recipes, Bacon Habanero Ranch, Lettuce Tomato Deluxe and Bacon & Cheese.","From a comparable sales standpoint, these new menu additions individually met or exceeded targeted performance levels. However, softer IEO environment and comparisons against prior-year promotion with chicken and beverage activity offset the sales driven by the new menu news. And while June comparable sales were slightly negative in the U.S., we continued to outpace the competitive set.","In June, I met with our leadership franchisees while they were in Oak Brook for one of their regularly scheduled meetings. While the challenges of operating a small business today are many, it is clear that we\u2019re aligned and focused on what's most important and that's the customer. It\u2019s that commitment to remaining customer centric, along with the assertive plans and vision we have in place, that enables all three legs of the McDonald\u2019s system to grow sales and profitability for the long-term.","Let's shift to Europe where comparable sales were down 10 basis points for the quarter and operating income was up 5% in constant currencies. The U.K. and Russia continued to deliver positive results, while weak performance in Germany and France persist. The U.K.\u2019s business remains solid. Second-quarter results and continued market share growth were driven by a balanced focus across value core new products and promotional offers.","The U.K. launch blended ice beverages in June, just in time to satisfy customers craving for something cool and refreshing during the summer months. The lineup includes two delicious fruit smoothies, strawberry and banana and mango and pineapple, and a line of frappes including Carmel and Iced Mocha.","Inspired by the U.S., these new products expand the overall beverage lineup and further validate blended ice as a proven system solution that can be deployed across markets worldwide. Russia also delivered positive performance for the quarter on top of last year's strong results. In addition to a focus on the Big Mac, two seasonal premium offerings, The Royal Cheeseburger and The Big Tasty with Bacon, contributed to Russia's performance and demonstrated the strong ongoing appeal of our brand in this growth market. We expect the lower inflationary environment in Russia to continue dampening our pricing power, pressuring near-term sales momentum compared to last year.","Moving over to France, comparable sales and guest count performance remained negative as the recession continues to pressure the informal eating out industry. However, we\u2019re growing market share by balancing value and premium products across the menu. For example, France recently added two new recipes to the popular Casse-Croute entr\u00e9e and drink combo. They contributed to market share growth during the lunch day part. This value offer was complemented by a strong focus on two premium beef burgers, Le M and Le 280.","In Germany, negative comparable sales and traffic trends persist. Our traffic has declined at a faster rate than the IEO industry, which also continues to contract. It\u2019s critical that our initiatives resonate with consumers in this environment and in this marketplace. So to re-establish our momentum, we are leveraging recent consumer insights and continuing to adjust our plans.","Let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa or APMEA. Comparable sales were down 30 basis points for the quarter and operating income increased 3% in constant currencies. Although market share improved in China, Australia, and Japan, comparable sales were negative for our big three markets. Positive performance in other markets like South Africa, Singapore, and South Korea partially mitigated the overall segment\u2019s decline.","Markets across APMEA are taking a holistic approach to stimulating demand. Across day parts, they are offering limited time and innovative products alongside established price value platforms. In Australia, we continued to grow market share by balancing our focus on the core with new product introductions and promotional activities. Strong performance in 2012 including the launch of our Loose Change menu along with external pressures in 2013 from lower levels of consumer spending and heightened competitive activity have contributed to weaker performance.","In Japan, consumers remain extremely price sensitive. Comparable sales have been positive the last two months, and we continue to grow share by leveraging limited time offerings like the Chicken Teritama and sharing options such as the Mega Potato to keep customers coming back to our restaurants and to build our average check.","In China, comparable sales were down 6.1% for the second quarter reflecting the negative impact from avian influenza, which continues to dissipate. We remain focused on leveraging promotional activities to showcase the diversity of our menu beyond chicken and strengthening our connection with customers through our ongoing brand trust campaign that focuses on the quality and the safety of our food.","We remain confident in our ability to drive future performance in China. Going forward, comprehensive plans for our key growth areas, particularly beverages, the family business, and the late night day part remain our top priorities.","Around the world and across our system, we are focused on ensuring our strategies and tactics resonate with customers. That's the key, the key to our performance today and for the long term. As I mentioned earlier, our market teams continue to strategically and thoughtfully adjust their plans in response to local consumer dynamics and growth opportunities.","At the same time, we remain committed to prudently investing our capital and resources in those initiatives that will further differentiate us from the competition for the long term. We're broadening accessibility by adding new restaurants, we're modernizing our existing restaurants with reimages and remodels, and we continue to deploy technology and convenience initiatives.","As our predominantly franchised business model continues to generate significant levels of cash, our priorities regarding the use of cash have not changed. After investing in our business, we're committed to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over the long term, first through dividends and then through share repurchases. For the second quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. ","In closing I want to reiterate my confidence in our business and in the growth opportunities that exist. We are diligently focused on executing the proven strategies within our plan to win. We have a resilient business model, an aligned and talented system, and an experienced management team.","We're leveraging these strengths and making deliberate, continued progress toward winning this battle for market share and fortifying our position as our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink.","With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter J. Bensen","Thanks Don, and hello everyone. McDonald's continued to grow revenues and net income in second quarter within the challenging global environment. The system remains focused on executing our strategies to become even more relevant to the 69 million customers we serve every day.","We continue to adjust our tactics where prudent and are committed to optimizing those factors within our control. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect these efforts to strengthen near-term performance while continuing to build our business for the long term.","For the six months ended June, system-wide sales increased 3% in constant currencies due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 30 basis points to 30.3% over that same period, primarily due to lower restaurant margin percentages.","We are primarily a franchisor with 81% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and women. Consolidated franchise margins contribute approximately 70% of our restaurant profits. This stable, predictable income stream benefits from comparable sales growth and is more insulated from inflationary and other cost pressures.","For the quarter, each area of the world contributed to franchise margin dollars growing 4% in constant currencies to more than $1.9 billion. The margin percent declined 40 basis points to 82.8% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher occupancy expenses.","Global company-operated margin dollars declined 1% in constant currencies to $842 million for the quarter. The margin percent decreased 50 basis points to 17.7% as higher labor, commodity, and other costs more than offset slightly positive comparable sales. The margin pressures for the quarter were most acute in the U.S. and APMEA while Europe grew its McOpCo margin.","In the U.S., second quarter company-operated margins declined 110 basis points to 18.7% due to higher labor occupancy and other operating costs. The McDonald's system is effectively managing commodity expenses with cost up about 1% in second quarter. The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 1.5% to 2.5%.","The U.S. has been deliberate regarding pricing seeking to remain below the food-away-from-home inflation index of 2.2%. Another relevant data point is Food At Home index which is up only 0.9%, somewhat limiting our pricing power. At the end of June, our U.S. price increase was 1.5% which is about 120 basis points less than one year ago.","As we move through the second half of the year, we will consider future price increases balancing our desire to grow traffic and market share amidst the reality of higher input costs. In addition to pricing, we're employing more suggestive selling strategies at the order point to encourage trials, new products and add-on purchases. As Don mentioned, it's a market share battle so we're employing a variety of strategies and tactics to grow traffic and increase relevance to our consumers.","Turning now to Europe, company-operated margins were probably the biggest positive of the quarter as they increased 10 basis points to 19.4%. Europe's McOpCo margins benefited from the significant contribution from the UK and Russia, our two strongest performing markets in the region who contribute nearly half of the segments company-operated margin dollars.","In addition, France and other markets realized labor productivity gains as part of their overall efforts to control costs and enhance efficiencies within the restaurants. Commodities increased about 2% for the quarter and for the full year, Europe's projected increase is now slightly lower at 2% to 3%.","Europe is a collection of 39 markets, so our price increases vary by market with Russia at the higher end due to its inflation albeit a little less than a year ago and all other markets averaging about 1.5% year-over-year. Similar to the U.S. we have less pricing power in 2013 versus a year ago.","In addition, given the economic environment in nearly all of our markets we're balancing a stronger emphasis on value with compelling premium products to effectively manage average check and margins. We have a strong underlying business in Europe and we believe we are making the right strategic decisions and value investments to protect and grow the band over the long term.","In Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 100 basis points to 14.3% due to new restaurant openings mainly in China along with higher labor costs throughout the segment. To a lesser extent, avian influenza impacted our sales and margins in second quarter, but our team work hard to manage expenses and other controllables to mitigate some of the negative impact.","G&A discipline remains an area of focus. We seek to grow sales and revenues faster than our G&A spend. Year-to-date, G&A as a percent of revenues was 8.8% versus 9% a year ago, which included our biennial Worldwide Convention. For the full-year, as part of our ongoing efforts we have reduced our G&A spend and now expect it to be relatively flat versus the prior-year due in part to lower incentive compensation and efficiencies we have identified.","The growth in revenues and operating income within our franchise business model translates into significant generation of cash. As Don reiterated, our first priority for this cash remains reinvesting in our business to drive future growth and returns. In light of the current environment we have trimmed our 2013 capital expenditure forecast by $100 million to about $3.1 billion. Although we will open about 50 fewer sites, we believe this is prudent given the short-term pressures. More importantly it will not undermine our long-term growth potential and the quality and returns of our new restaurants remain very solid.","The remainder of our capital is being invested in existing restaurants, in part through reimaging more than 1,600 location\u2019s, we\u2019re making steady progress in our efforts to modernize our brand with about 50% of our exteriors and about 60% of our interiors on a global basis reflecting the current contemporary look. In the U.S. this year we will touch about 10% of our traditional brief standing portfolio through a combination of reimaging, rebuild and new restaurants, this will put us close to the 50% mark. Within the next year a U.S. customer more often than us will experience our brand in a more modern and relevant manner than before. We\u2019re excited about the potential that this brings to our largest market.","Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted second quarter results by $0.02 more than originally forecasted as several currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. At current exchange rates we expect a negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02 on third quarter EPS with a full-year negative impact of $0.07 to $0.09. As usual though, please take this as directional guidance only because rates will continue to change as we progress throughout the second half of the year.","Despite flat to declining and formal eating out markets around the world McDonald\u2019s grew revenue operating income and earnings per share in second quarter. Our results underscore the solid performance, the solid platform from which we are operating. A unique franchise business model that harnesses the entrepreneurial spirit of local businessmen and women will operate approximately 28,000 of our nearly 35,000 restaurants around the world. The powerful alignment of our system around the strategies and key growth priorities that have allowed us to maintain or grow our industry leading market share in most of our major markets and a strong financial foundation that allows us to invest for the future while making prudent decisions to deliver near term performance. We remain confident in our brand and the competitive advantages of our system which we believe will continue to drive positive results over the long-term. Thanks.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Kathy Martin","Thanks, Pete. I am going to open the call now for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask a question, maybe a multiple-part question on U.S. sales. So you commented on the U.S. second quarter performance being better than the QSR sector as a whole. Could you quantify what you think the QSR sector did for the quarter and was that also true in the month of June for U.S. performance versus IEO, and maybe in conjunction with that, just talk about pulling monopoly forward, kicking it off this week, just the rationale behind that decision?","Don Thompson","Hi Joe, this is Dan. Thanks so much for the question, and I\u2019ll try to address some of the points that you made, and you can -- if there\u2019s anything we missed, you let us know, but -- if we look overall in the U.S., it looks like and I\u2019ll speak from an informal eating out perspective. It appears that we gained about 10 basis points in the informal eating out category relative to traffic. So, we know that the things that we\u2019ve put in place are definitely having some impact and it also speaks to some of the things that took place relative to our focus on new products. And so, again looking at the U.S., we know that this year we were lapping some of the implementations of some of the beverage strategies from last year which launched a little bit earlier, Cherry Berry Chiller. We also know there was a frappe launch earlier in the year. We also had 20 piece nuggets that were launched last year. The great thing for us is that the products that we\u2019ve implemented in the chicken, breakfast, beverages, and beef category being Egg White Delight, Blueberry Pomegranate, the wraps, the Quarter Pounders, those things have performed well and met or exceeded the targeted sales, but again some of the offsets that Pete and I mentioned are some of the reasons that sales are softer aside from the fact that the informal eating out category is projected to be down about 50 basis points. So we know that, we put things in place to address that in the U.S. and we have outperformed the competition. We do know that we\u2019ve outperformed them on a year-to-date basis from a comparable sales performance by a little bit over 1%.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. I guess just one that you guys didn\u2019t touch on there was around the Monopoly pull forward, if you could touch on that and then just bigger picture, the comments in the press release and in your prepared remarks about a challenging environment over the rest of the year, I don\u2019t think you guys normally talk about the forward outlook quite this much, so I am just wondering what are your thoughts, kind of what's changed since the April call, and would we be considering kind of challenges, meaning kind of flat comps continuing over the next several months, is that the kind of message that you\u2019re trying to send? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Thanks, Jason. As you know, we don\u2019t give -- we\u2019re not giving out guidance, that\u2019s not our practice. We do expect the remainder of 2013 to remain challenged based on existing top and bottom line pressures. We know we\u2019re seeing ongoing global economic headwinds. We\u2019re seeing flatter declining IEO markets and ongoing competition chasing fewer guest counts as a result of a less and discretionary spending. We also know that this is a more price sensitive timeframe based on these economies, and we still have ongoing P&L pressures including higher labor and commodity costs, and we have less ability to take that price. So, relative to those things, that\u2019s kind of the -- if you would, the framework around the comments that we made, we continue to believe the long-term, the average annual financial targets that we put in place are achievable and appropriate. We do know, however, in the near term that we\u2019re going to face some tough economies around the world and the informal eating out industry is softer around the world, and a matter of fact, 7 out of -- 11 out of our top markets we\u2019re seeing contraction from an IEO perspective.","Peter J. Bensen","And Jason, regarding Monopoly, that was a decision last fall when the U.S. was looking at their calendar and looking at the product launch lineup thinking about, how do we follow-up the introduction of these great new products with a way to continue the momentum and we know that Monopoly is always a great transaction driver, and these new products are prominently featured in the Monopoly promotions, so following those product launches up with Monopoly, it seemed like a very prudent thing to do.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Hi, thanks very much. Following up on the U.S., Don when you see the IEO market in the U.S., what definition do you use for that? It seems to me, I recall that you use a broader definition than just a quick service hamburger market; and if that\u2019s the case, could any of the weakness be described by or explained by some of your near-end competitors doing better? And secondly, what is the dynamic in the U.S.? Is the low-end customer still there, but the high end maybe moved off and maybe they\u2019re not taking you up on some of the higher end offers, what's the dynamic underneath the weakness in comps?","Don Thompson","All right, and thanks for the question John. First of all, the definition we use is really more of a protocol, is CREST. CREST is the information that we use relative to our informal eating out data, and they are fairly broad data base to your point. So we look at the overall informal eating out industry, that is what helps us whether it would be identifying opportunities or looking at who may or may not be doing as well in the industry at that point in time. So, it really is a good barometer of the overall marketplace that QSR segment is a little bit \u2013 it's a little bit more, I don't want to call it myopic, but it's a much smaller view of the overall marketplace. So as we've looked at that that's how we know that the overall marketplace was going to drop by about 50 basis points. Now the interesting thing about IEO is that QSR makes up the vast majority of IEO. And so, when you hear us talk about IEO, we are talking in a large part also about the QSR industry. As we look forward and if you look at who's winning, who's not winning in the marketplace, we do know that we've gained market share, we know there are a couple of other players that have gained market share. And what we do is we continue to look at our performance relative to the categories of growth which I mentioned earlier which were chicken, beverages, breakfast, and then we also look at the premium beef category which is why you saw it implement the Quarter Pounder line with the three different recipes which is why you've seen us leverage our beverage strategy, which we still have some opportunities to leverage that to an even greater extent. And so, we're going to continue to do that. But when you look across our product implementations this year, they have hit each of the growth categories, and so we feel fairly good. Those products have met or exceeded the expectations we had. As I mentioned, we did see some offset based upon last year's promotional activity particularly around 20 Piece Nuggets and in some of our beverage strategies.","Kathy Martin","Okay. Our next question is from Keith Siegner from Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks. If I could just ask another U.S. question kind of more broadly thinking about the IEO market, it seems like a lot of the disappointment say versus our expectations at least on this side have come from IEO market disappointment. If you think through the fact that you've got food at home now running significantly below total food away from home, even though you're running below food away from home in terms of pricing, I guess what I'm asking is, is the setup that the food away from home industry might be pricing a little too aggressively in a low inflation environment? How do you think about the relative share trends across IEO versus food at home? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Hi, Keith. I'm going to let Pete talk a little bit about what's taking place and relative to our own pricing. What I would tell you and I mentioned it in my comments, one thing we do see in the broader industry is we're seeing a lot of discounting, price discounting rather than consistent value platforms which we have around the globe and we've put in place, and we're going to maintain that consistency because it's important to consumers. We know that, but we have seen a lot of, I'll say, sporadic price discounting across the marketplace. But relative to what we've done and how we've seen pricing, I'll ask Pete to make some comments.","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, Keith, one of the things I mentioned, we're up about 1.5 in pricing in the U.S. on a trailing 12-month basis. That's 120 basis points below where we were a year ago. It's clearly one of the factors that is contributing to comps maybe being not as strong as some would think. When we look at the dynamics at food away from home, it's up 2.5%; food at home up only 0.9%. That's on a trailing 12-month basis through June, so comparable to our 1.5% price increase. But for the full year both food away from home and food at home are currently projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% each. So what will be interesting we will definitely be looking at those as we move throughout the year and making decisions about what we're going to do with price for the remainder of the year, but as you point out to the extent that food at home continues to be at a significantly lower growth rate the grocery store is a competitor and that does impact the industry's ability to pass on price.","Kathy Martin","Okay. Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer Securities","Thank you. A bright spot in the quarter was the profit growth in Europe. You had a slightly negative comp and you're able to somewhat increase the McOpCo margins there. So can you explain how that's possible? How did that happen? And is that sustainable if we have continued weak flattish type comps over in Europe going forward?","Don Thompson","Hi, Brian. This is Don. I'm going to ask Tim to make some comments about Europe and productivity. I know he's made quite a few business to the marketplace there relative to what we're doing in McOpCo and how we're focused on our margins there and the profitability and productivity aspects of the business. Tim?","Tim Fenton","Brian, first of all as Pete mentioned the UK and Russia have been two of our best performing countries in Europe which represent almost 50% of our company-operated margins. But in spite of \u2013 along with that, the team has really done a great job of fine-tuning their P&L efficiencies particularly in labor scheduling and food cost controls, so they've done a very good job on scheduling efficiencies and just working those through the P&L, so we're very happy with the progress they've made.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.","Matt DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. I guess just looking at the guidance and the end of the 8K there, you talk about G&A. It looks like it's a little bit of a change from previous where you were 2% to 3% constant currency growth, now you're flat. I was wondering what came out of that? Is it simply just a lower outlook brings about lower compensation or is there \u2013 some of the technology spend that you did last year that you thought was going to continue at the same pace, have you been able to save money or you're deferring that to '14? Thanks.","Peter J. Bensen","Matt, it's really a combination of factors. Obviously the technology spend we think is an important long-term differentiator for us and a lot of that is in the restaurants. So we're appropriately pacing that. There's other areas that we look at for efficiencies in terms of spending. And then finally as you mentioned, lower performance will yield lower incentive comp and so there's a lower outlook for that as well. So it's a combination of all of those.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. First, as we look at the European business, seems like economists are getting a little bit more bullish on the European economy and like people are calling for bottoming in the middle of '13 and recovery starting late in '13. So being that you get to service all those markets across Europe, I'm just wondering on the trends you see within the data, how would you size up the pace or do you feel confident, a likelihood of recovery seem like France and Germany would need to improve before perhaps the UK and or Russia slows, I'm just wondering how you'd size it up based on the data you're seeing? And the follow-up is just \u2013 I mean the quality of comments you guys gave for the rest of the \u2013 the remainder of the year being challenged. I'm just wondering because you said fairly. A couple of times I know you mentioned that you still grew revenues, operating income and earnings in the second quarter and in the first quarter as well. I'm just wondering if that's a reasonable assumption for the back half of the year or would that dynamic change? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Hi, Jeff. Just a little bit maybe on the European economy and then as we talk about challenges for the rest of the year. First of the all European economy, I can give you a perspective. All of us travel quite a bit to our markets. I don't know \u2013 the economists may be a bit ahead of themselves. That's my personal perspective but it's based upon the fact that if you look at GDP growth even quarter one versus year ago or even as you roll into quarter two, France is still in a recession two quarters now that we've seen negative GDP growth. We had Germany, which is negative in GDP growth. Spain is still suffering. From an unemployment perspective, you've got much higher unemployment than the norm across Europe. Youth unemployment is something that is somewhat alarming whether it be in France at 26%, Spain at 57%. You've got markets \u2013 I was recently in Portugal and Ireland, you got markets, some markets may have bottomed out. I would tell you some of the larger markets are still having some challenges. So we're looking forward to the bottom out, so to speak, and then a resurgence. At times you'll see a resurgence in some of the markets. Europe for us means 39 different areas and countries that we're working in, but it is a \u2013 it's still a challenged environment. The wonderful thing for us and I call it a wonderful thing because if we weren't focused on having implemented the value platforms when we did about a year ago, we would've lost more traffic. At this stage of the game, we are continuing to gain market share across the majority of European countries and that is the position we wanted to be in. Solidify market share, solidify customer visits, those things then we know lead to \u2013 with business you can get sales, with sales you can get profitability, but you have to have the sales coming in the front door. And so for us right now Europe is still a big challenge. As we look across the rest of the year, the notion \u2013 when we made the comment about challenge, it is similar to the second quarter. So as we see third and fourth quarters, we see them similar to the second quarter where we still see the ability for us to continue to move the business forward, however they are challenging environments, and you know we don\u2019t give guidance but we\u2019re just really being as transparent as we\u2019ve always been relative to what we see in the market places.","Kathy Martin","All right. Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning. My question is on the CapEx guidance revision and I just wonder philosophically why the need to turn the CapEx for this year and you mentioned that you wanted to be conservative with that even though the returns on those investments look good. So, I\u2019m just wondering what is going on, on that line and what you might be seeing that\u2019s giving you a pause there?","Peter J. Bensen","David, it's really only about 50 openings that we trim from the guidance. So, to your point, new restaurant openings are our highest returning investments and the new openings over the last 12 months are no exception to that, they have generally being performing well. With the exception probably of China where, with the chicken issues in China and the slower economic growth there, that is the biggest of all of the markets contributing to the 50 store decline. So they took a hard look at their inventory, some of the sites they\u2019re pushing off to the future are open. And if you think about our opening cycle there is 12 to 24 months from the time we identify a site until we go to ground break, so that\u2019s a lot of time for the market dynamics to shift around a little bit. So we\u2019re just fine tuning around the edges, some of the inventory and not making any dramatic changes to our outlook for our new restaurant openings or our overall CapEx spend.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham.","Mitch Speiser - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much, and considering the U.S. the Company operated margin decline of 110 bips. Can you perhaps try and parse that out between cost pressures and promotional activity?","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, Mitch. Pricing \u2013 being down 120 basis points in pricing is probably the single biggest contributor to the margin weakness there, but we had pressure across a lot of the lines in the P&L. So without that extra pricing, wage rates, little lower efficiency, we threw a lot of new products at the restaurants this quarter. So our efficiency per crew hour was down a little bit. We had additional depreciation from reimages that continue, and we had the increased additional advertising and promotional cost from the new product. So we had, on the cost side these incremental pressures that were not overcome by a stronger comp.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Michael Kelter from Goldman.","Michael Kelter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I guess with all respect throughout the economy being tough, ultimately between the focus on value messaging and the new products that you\u2019re saying you\u2019re all hitting targets, realistically it's just not moving the needle for you in this environment. So, I guess my question is; what do you need to do to adjust? Essentially other than the economy getting better, what are you going to do differently to get more people in the doors in the next 6 to 12 months?","Don Thompson","Hi, Michael, this is Don. First point and I want to reiterate it. We\u2019re winning in the market place. When we look at market share across our major markets, we are gaining market share and that\u2019s an important factor here. So, if you ask what do we need to do to adjust? I think we need to continue to adjust. We\u2019ve been adjusting now for about the last couple of years relative to making sure we had solid value platforms. We\u2019ve ensured that we have a good mix of value and premium based products, so we can gain as much margin as possible. What we don\u2019t have and Pete just mentioned it, is we don\u2019t have as much pricing power. And as long as inflationary rates are lower and as long as GDP growth and consumer discretionary spending is softer we\u2019re not going to move forward and take a lot of price because we know that it would mean guest count erosion longer term. So we\u2019ll be mindful of the price increases that we take. We\u2019ll continue to make sure that our value platforms are installed and strong. We\u2019ll make sure that we have a very solid menu pipeline which has helped us to as you see in the U.S. to outperform the competition in mass, and so when we look at what we\u2019re doing now, we think those are the right things to do. Pete mentioned growing the business and developing new sites. Our new sites are performing relatively well and so we\u2019re going to continue to invest capital there. The returns on reimage sites when you have less comparable sales that gets a little bit tight and we\u2019ll continue to monitor that, to Pete\u2019s point is we always do from a financially responsible perspective, but good pipelines, good value, good marketing campaigns, those things will continue. As I mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to invest in technology and we think we do still have some room to grow relative to some of the things we can offer our consumers from an engagement perspective there, and we\u2019ll continue to make sure we have good marketing spend, good awareness relative to our advertising. So, we\u2019re going to continue doing those things and implement those solidly. We\u2019ll continue focusing on the growth strategies we\u2019ve talked about. There is room to grow in beverages, and in chicken, and in breakfast, and we\u2019re moving breakfast around the globe. So all of these pieces are the things that for us we still have a lot of work to do at McDonald\u2019s and we\u2019ll continue to focus on those areas.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jeff Farmer, Wells Fargo.","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo Advisors","Don, I just want to get a better read on your view of the U.S. consumer. It looks like obviously both quick service and casual dining consumers in the U.S. are pulling back on spending pretty dramatically in June and July. So from what you\u2019re seeing with your own customers, what are some of the key economic drivers on the more conservative behavior and what I mean is just more specially the last couple of months, it seems like a line has been drawn in the sand, consumers have definitely stayed away from pretty much all forms of restaurants or at least cut down on their occasions, I mean again just curious what your view is on what's going on?","Don Thompson","Hi, Jeff, a great question and the way you positioned it is accurate as we\u2019ve seen it. We have not drawn a direct correlation as if yet, the sequestration or other I\u2019ll say tactical executions that have occurred in the U.S. what we do know is that there was a pullback to some extent, and it does seem to be impacting the informal eating out industry a little bit more or so than broader retail. So, again what we have to do is make sure that we institute and continue to have solid value and we have to do that by balancing and also with some innovative new news, this is going to be absolutely critical for us as we move forward. We have to continue to invest in the business appropriately, but make sure we\u2019re mindful of the returns. I don\u2019t foresee this changing in the next couple of months which is why we spoke of the rest of the year being challenging. And what we see in the United States is not unlike what we see in some of the other markets that are out there. Having said that, we feel pretty solid about the fact that we can continue to gain market share and that our focus. And if we can do that, we\u2019ll gain additional guest counts, we\u2019ll gain additional sales and we\u2019ll gain additional profitability. The pricing piece that Pete mentioned again is going to be tougher through the rest of the year in terms of taking price. So, we\u2019ll be monitoring that and measuring that relative to our margins. But again the market place itself is a little bit -- it is a little bit tighter than we\u2019ve seen. But one thing we\u2019ve never done at McDonald\u2019s, we don\u2019t cry or whine over market conditions, because all of us are in the same market conditions. So we just have to stay focused on what we do best which is move the business in the way as we\u2019ve discussed today.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Andy Barish, Jefferies.","Andy Barish - Jefferies","Hey, guys, one quick follow-up and then one new area. Just in terms of the monopoly shift does that open up the October window for a new product platform potentially here, and then just on the new front, on franchise margins they continue to slip a little bit; is that purely a function of getting comp back into solidly positive territory to see return or should we expect some of the higher D&A and occupancy to continue to weigh at least near term on franchise margins?","Don Thompson","Hey, Andy I\u2019m going to let Tim make a comment relative to monopoly. I think he\u2019ll make a pretty solid point about whether or not it opens up another opportunity, clearly we can speak to specifics but he just finished one of the reviews with the U.S. business, so he can give you a couple of headlines as to some of the things I discussed. Relative to franchise margins we\u2019ll have Pete make a comment on that after Tim.","Tim Fenton","Okay, well Andy I can\u2019t say specifically on what products we have coming in, but we have a pretty robust fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter coming down the pike. And as far as monopoly we moved it in as everyone has stated already and really take advantage of the food traffic that we do have in our third quarter. So, product\u2019s coming, can\u2019t get specific on it.","Peter J. Bensen","Andy, you point out the franchise margins they are compared in the capital margins. They're even more sensitive to the comp because the base of cost is more fixed. So the depreciation and the rents are really \u2013 we really need a stronger comp to start to get that percentage to move upwards.","Don Thompson","Andy too, and I know we've talked about this and we've tried to relate on the call, the new products that we've implemented have resonated with consumers. And I want to make sure that everyone understands that IEO is relatively flat and declining in many of the markets around the world. So we're not going to change that menu pipeline execution strategy. It is absolutely working. However, we are facing some headwinds and so we'll continue to execute that, continue to make our target to outperform in the marketplace as a whole. But I think you are quite clairvoyant to the fact that there may be something that does come up in the latter part of the year relative to new products.","Kathy Martin","All right. Next question is from Bryan Elliot, Raymond James.","Bryan Elliot - Raymond James","Thank you. I'd like to talk about competitive environment outside of the U.S. So the informal eating out market particularly in Europe has been soft for some time. Are you seeing evidence yet of some shrinkage in supply and also thinking about China, which has been through a meaningful short-term contraction, if there's been any shakeout of competition, particularly thinking of maybe of local type, non-deep pocket type competition and if you're seeing any benefit potentially down the road from some of that?","Don Thompson","Hi, Bryan. Outside of the U.S., some of the competitive sets are different. I'll ask Tim to speak a little bit to some of the things that he's seeing out there. But keep this in mind. The U.S. is \u2013 there are a couple of markets that are similar to the U.S. and not quite to the U.S. level relative to the competitive density of competitors as we know them. In many of these cases you have more as we would define them smaller chains, mom and pop type organizations. So we do see consolidation in some of those smaller ones when you get into recessionary periods or macroeconomic conditions like these, but relative to whether or not we've seen larger chains that are consolidating that's not something that I have seen. But Tim, I don't know what else we've seen out there in your travels.","Tim Fenton","Bryan, a lot of couponing and vouchering going on, but we're seeing a rise in the non-traditional competitors that we've faced in the past, particularly cafes, convenience stores, bakeries and supermarkets coming up with ready-to-eat meals. So that's been a resurgence for them, particularly in Europe. On China, the overall chicken market is kind of taking a step backwards as it pertains to the IEO. It's starting to dissipate now and coming back but particularly I would say in Western QSR has probably taken the biggest decline.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question's from John Ivankoe, JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. It seemed in the last release, in the April release and on that conference call, you were a little bit more protective about profitability in the U.S. and I wonder if there is a change if I'm right in sensing that, there is a change relative \u2013 how we're thinking about the business now? And of course I ask that in the context of the franchisees, which I think make more money per store level than \u2013 I know make more money per store level than any other major franchisee group if they've really signed on to I think what you're asking them is less pricing, continue with the Dollar Menu, focus on driving traffic even if it doesn't necessarily come to an extent of increasing their near-term store level cash flow?","Don Thompson","Hi, John. Thanks for the question. I would tell you the franchisees have done I think a stellar job in this environment and if you think about it from their perspective, several things. One is they've definitely been aligned relative to the things that we have asked of them focusing on the customer, ensuring that we continue to invest in the business, whether it be reimages or whether it be with new products and the new product introductions. We have really accelerated some of those introductions and getting those to the marketplace because it's very important to have new news and exciting news as well as to execute value. They have been very, very aligned on the value campaign and platform. Having said that, they've given a lot of feedback relative to what does the Dollar Menu look like today and how we need to maintain that and what things we might need to look at in terms of any modifications at any point in time. So I think the franchisees have done a really, really solid job. They've continued to invest in the business and we along with them in the business, they are one of the greatest assets to this overall McDonald's family has. I'd also add along with that, our suppliers because they are in an interesting commodity and legislative environment as well as the franchisees and small business owners. And they also have supported our system relative to how we want to be able to manage through these macroeconomic issues around the world. And so I can't say anything but be complementary about what our franchisees have done relative to the cash flow investments, their focus on the business, their focus on the customers, their focus on their employees and they're focused on a broader alignment around the McDonald system.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from R.J. Hottovy from Morningstar.","R.J. Hottovy - Morningstar Research","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to keep it in the U.S. for a minute. You talked about the new products, innovations meeting or exceeding expectations. I was hoping to get some color on the Dollar Menu, just in particular your thoughts about the recent Dollar Menu performance and how that compares to your expectations especially with so much promotional activity in the environment? Thanks.","Don Thompson","Hi, R.J. The Dollar Menu itself still represents about 13% to 14% of sales, which is still in that same range it's been in. What has benefited us has been the fact that it is a consistent execution and it still has tremendous alignment across the franchises and the McOpCo restaurants that we have. So it is the value platform of choice. Now we've done a couple of things to try to add some new news to that which also help us to be a little bit more margin accretive, things like the Grilled Onion Cheddar Sandwich, Hot 'n Spicy McChicken limited time offer selections that we placed into the Dollar Menu. Even having done those, we still remain at 13% to 14% of sales based upon the Dollar Menu. So it is a solid platform for us. The last thing I'll mention is, early on we talked about the fact that there are \u2013 Tim mentioned we see a lot of discounting in the broader marketplace. We know that one of the most important things that customers look for is consistency in terms of the value platform. They want to know that they can depend on McDonald's to continue to deliver value every day all day and the platform for us is more than about short-term discounts. It's about establishing customer loyalty versus being aggressive for one or two months. We need long-term loyalty. We want a strong customer base. We want to make sure we drive business frequency and we want to support the introduction also of higher margin products, so build the base so that when we implement new products, those products have more awareness relative to our consumer base. So we've established these branded affordability platforms around the world now and they are performing to the levels that we would like. We have a couple of markets, R.J., that we still need to do a little bit of work and Tim is focused on some of those markets. But by and large, we're in a pretty solid place relative to the value platforms around the world.","Kathy Martin","Next question is Peter Saleh from Telsey Advisor Group.","Peter Saleh - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Great, thank you. I know it's still early but maybe you could give us a little bit of a preview on your outlook for commodities for 2014. We've seen the grain prices coming down and I remember last summer, we had gain prices really shooting up because of the drought and your team in the U.S. at least was able to do a pretty good job in terms of your exposure for this year. So any thoughts on '14 would be pretty helpful?","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, Peter, it's premature for us to give any numerical guidance but you can imagine as you point out that our team is constantly looking at how do we best deliver that stable, predictable price to the restaurants. While we're not trying to be market timers, we obviously do look at the markets to see when conditions might be better to layer on some coverage and you can imagine that we are working with our suppliers and our suppliers are putting hedges on, going into next year to provide us some of that stability. Probably at the Analyst Meeting in November it's when we'll start to give some numerical texture on 2014.","Kathy Martin","Your next question is Nicole Miller from Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. You've talked about new news and I\u2019m wondering if it's fair to kind of assess that as evolutions of current platforms and I am asking because it seemed like you bought a lot of customization of these platforms to the menu and I\u2019m wondering how you feel about that being a key driver of sales and profits versus your peer group?","Don Thompson","Hi, Nicole. I think you see both. You'll see some areas that are customization, if you would, and I assume you're talking about things like the Quarter Pounder line, which will also see some new platforms like you\u2019re seeing with McWraps. You will see us also do limited time offers. So relative to beverages or whether it be the other products that we\u2019d implement. I think Tim gave some insight as to other thing that we might see in the U.S., but this is consistent also Tim around the world.","Tim Fenton","Yeah and in the U.S. Egg White Delight being able to put that different muffins and different carriers. But as we move into the platform deployment of made for you, you\u2019re seeing more customization.","Kathy Martin","All right. We have time for one last question. Paul Westra from Stifel.","Paul Westra - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company Inc.","Great. Thank you. I was wondering if we get an update on the value menu efforts in France, particularly maybe Australia a bit. I know you [indiscernible] menu there and given a softness economically, I was curious to give as much color as we can about the mix, the value effort there and may be the percentage of add-on sales within that menu that helps pay for it, is that progressing as planned? And I guess a related question to the loose menu effort in Australia. I\u2019m just somewhat surprised about the overall comp going negative with the great success of the loose menu, seems would have prepared you well for this year\u2019s economic softness, and curious maybe about market share changes in Australia as well?","Don Thompson","Hi, Paul. I will \u2013 I can speak to the end of that with Australian market share changes and then I will ask Tim to talk about the other part of your question, which was France and France\u2019s value piece. Relative to Australia, Australia is another one of those markets that at this point in time we see from their perspective you\u2019re seeing some softer \u2013 clearly a softer economy, youth unemployment in Australia is about 25.5%. So they\u2019re facing some thing, unemployment for them has risen. Having said that, Australia is also one of the markets that we\u2019ve had some solid share gains in and continue to have share gains in Australia. The \u2013 so the broader marketplace we\u2019ve seen some \u2013 we see some tough economy, but we\u2019ve also seen some share gain and we\u2019ve seen our business meeting forward there. And again, I think the franchisees and the folks, the Company employees and suppliers have done a good job there. So, Tim anything on France?","Tim Fenton","Yeah Paul, France if you remember us talking about Casse-Croute, which is a Baguette Sandwich and a drink for under \u20ac5 has done extremely well for us, particularly in the lunch day part. France is gaining market share in a declining IEO environment. The thing that we\u2019re working on to address is looking at some erosion at the dinner time and the folks have done a really good job of putting some products in test to address that, but it\u2019s a tough environment there. They\u2019re gaining share at the expense of the rest of the IEO players.","Kathy Martin","All right. Thanks everyone. We got some final remarks from Don.","Don Thompson","First of all, thank you all again for being on today\u2019s call and participating. And as we wrap up the call, I want to make sure that you all understand that while we recognize that this is a challenging environment, we\u2019ve been through challenging environments before as McDonald\u2019s. Our confidence in our brand and the competitive advantages of our system, truly are strength and a reflection of our ability to build on and learn from the past, having went through cycles before, these are different when you see them in the broad nature of these around the globe. But we\u2019ve been purposeful and we\u2019ve been agile, very flexible in our local markets about how we address some of the challenges there.","We are going to be and continue to be strategic relative to the way that we plan and evolve based upon customers spending habits, their discretionary opportunities, and the fact that we want to be their favorite place and wait to eat. So we look to evolving with our customers, evolving in these marketplaces and leveraging our history to make sure we mitigate through these challenges. Thanks so much for all of your support and your questions and have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s call.

(Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin ","Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. With me on the call are our President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson and our CFO, Pete Bensen. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by phone, webcast, and podcast. ","And before I turn it over to Don I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. And both documents are both available at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone. Before I discuss our second quarter results I wanted to provide a brief perspective on our performance relative to our expectations. I also want to share with you how our strategies have evolved, to guide our actions going forward. As we shared with you at our Investor meeting last November and in the last couple of quarterly calls we entered 2014 well aware of the challenges we face for comparable sales and margins amid ongoing broad based challenges and cost pressures throughout our P&L. And we don't expect any material changes to this operating environment in the second half of the year. ","Our financial model is built on growing comparable sales, which in turn drive profitability. So when comparable sales are relatively flat as in second quarter our ability to grow income is significantly impacted. We've often said that there is no one silver bullet or single solution for driving sustained growth. In fact the key to our success over time has been that we've executed multiple initiatives simultaneously. Enduring success requires an ever stronger foundation. So we're pushing forward on a multiple fronts as we focus on those areas within our control to enhance our relevance and appeal to consumers. ","Earlier this year we evolved our Plan to Win Framework, refocusing our planning and actions on what matters most to our customers; relevant food choices, easier engagement with our brand through digital and greater transparency into the quality of our food and what we stand for as a brand. Serving good food through good people and being a good neighbor in the communities in which we operate is what McDonald\u2019s stands for. ","In April we shared our updated global Plan to Win framework with the more than 15,000 franchises, suppliers and company employees at our Biannual Worldwide Convention. Our decentralized system is now moving forward as we run with more than 35,000 restaurants in 119 countries aligned around an evolved global Plan to Win framework and executing in a way that takes into account local consumer needs and local business environments. ","As we work to regain business momentum we are pursuing two parallel paths. First, we are strengthening key foundational elements of our business to deliver our better overall customer experience today. And second, we are making progress on comprehensive strategies in pursuit of the sizeable growth opportunities that lie before us. These activities are interrelated and together they position us to drive profitable growth over the long turn. ","Let me talk first about the work currently underway for foundational elements of our business today. These include value first. We are evaluating the relationship between pricing and quality perception across our menu board and that's because value is one of our grand pillars. So we must continue to fortify our position within this key consumer attribute. ","Second, operations and service; around the world we are enhancing our operations and service platforms to improve the customer experience and ultimately increase visits. This includes the service reset in the United States and servicing kitchen enhancements in Europe. ","Third, marketing. We are taking actions to reestablish our marketing leadership position globally. In some markets, this means adding fresh perspectives by bringing in new leadership or agency partners. In others it means heightening our awareness of how customers use McDonald\u2019s and creating stronger messages to reinforce our place in customers\u2019 lives. And around the world we are also strengthening our creative messages by placing greater emphasis on the quality of our food and again reestablishing the emotional connection that our customers associate with the McDonald\u2019s experience. ","The fourth area is simplification. We are streamlining our merchandizing menu board and product offerings and in addition to making it easier for customer to order their favorite products, this will reduce complexity in our restaurants which in turn should enhance accuracy and speed of service.","Getting these foundational element right is critical to maximizing the impact of the additional growth initiatives that we are actively pursuing within the strategic priorities of the Plan to Win framework. Specifically these growth initiatives include menu customization and personalization, digital engagement and brand trust. In the area of menu customization and personalization our initial efforts focus on delivering the best burger experience to our customers. I'll talk more later about our learning lab we recently established in the United States to help us better understand what matters most to customers in this arena today? ","We are also accelerating our digital leverage as we talked about before, leveraging learning from markets like France and Australia we\u2019re now executing some elements of our e-commerce digital strategies. We are also testing various additional elements of our strategy in other markets like the U.S, Sweden and the UK as we refine and execute our global digital vision. And we are taking meaningful action to become even a more respected brand including our work with the World Wildlife Fund and the Alliance for Healthier Generation which was found by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation. These represent just the subset of our broader sustainability efforts. ","We are pursuing these initiatives holistically and building on investments we already made to deliver an unparalleled experience to our customers and consumers in general. It\u2019s these combined efforts that give me confidence in the future and our ability to drive enduring profitable growth for our system and our shareholders over the long turn.","Let's now turn to performance for the quarter. Global comparable sales were relatively flat for the second quarter and comparable guest counts were negative. Operating income was down 1% in constant currencies and earnings per share was $1.40, a 1% increase in constant currencies. Several markets delivered solid results, stronger operating income performance in China, the UK and France was offset by weaker performance in markets including Germany, Japan, the U.S. and Australia. These four markets remain priority areas of focus for us and I'll talk more later about the actions we're taking in these markets to reignite momentum.","We're moving with a sense of urgency but recognize that it will take time to see the results of our actions. Our franchise business model is a clear advantage for us but it also requires alignment around our plans and actions and this takes time. Once allied it takes time to enact changes in the restaurant and time for customers to notice the changes we've made and reward us with more visits. Therefore we expect continued volatility across markets for the second half of the year and expect full year 2014 global comparable sales to be relatively similar to year-to-date June performance with July global comparable sales excepted to be negative. ","Let\u2019s talk more specifically about performance and the actions we are talking by geography starting with the U.S. In the United States comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.5% and operating income increased 1%. While comparable sales were disappointing the U.S. is making progress in three critical areas, improving service through the operations reset, focusing on menu and strengthening our marketing position. The service reset was designed to place greater emphasis on the critical role of proper staffing, scheduling and positioning in our restaurants across all the day parts. ","Over the last six months our operation support staff are making [inaudible] with all franchise and company owned restaurants to recalibrate around service and customer experience standards. Restaurants across the U.S. are now executing as planned and we are beginning to see a reduction in order accuracy complaints. ","From a menu standpoint, we are placing greater emphasis on the balance between our core classics and the number of new products that are being introduced into the marketplace and this is to ensure that they can be delivered at the speed and convenience that customers expect from McDonald's. ","We are also continuing to innovate. We recently started a restaurant on the West Coast and created a learning lab to help better understand what matters most to customers when it comes to delivering the absolute best burger experience. It definitely starts with great ingredients like our high quality burger, 100% beef with a pinch of salt and pepper but it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s about creating an engaging experience which addresses all elements of customer sensory perceptions and leverages the investments that we already made in technology, reimaging our physical plans and digital to create a more personalized memorable experience that our customers will feel good about.","The U.S. is also taking actions to strengthen marketing leadership. We reorganized the marketing department and are reallocating our median mix to place greater emphasis on digital channels. We are also strengthening our creative, to connect more deeply with customers placing an even greater emphasis on the quality of our great food and on the strong emotional connection that our customers already have with our great brand.","Let\u2019s now move to Europe, where comparable sales were down 1% for the quarter and operating income was down 4% in constant currencies. These results reflect solid performance in the UK and France partially offset by weak results in Germany and a slowdown in Russia. The UK\u2019s track record of solid performance continues due in part to its strong customer centric planning process. While second quarter comparable sales were positive they softened compared to recent trends, partially because we are now lapping last year\u2019s successful blended ice rollout.","We continue to grow market share through strong premium promotional activity which is complemented by an ongoing focus on breakfast, extended hours and side-by-side dry fruits. Comparable sales continue to be positive in France and we are gaining market share despite a contracting informal eating out industry. The recent launch of our new premium Chicken Patty in April helped reinforce strong food quality perceptions in the marketplace.","Germany remains the primary area of focus as negative sales and guest count momentum continues. The leadership team is actively working to reset the foundation, focusing its efforts on improving our food quality and value perceptions and regaining consumers trust. These include strengthening our marketing organization in creative and evaluating our affordability platform and ensure that we offer compelling values to customers across the entire menu.","Now let\u2019s shift to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were up 1.1% for the quarter and operating income increased 1% in constant currencies. Strong comparable sales performance in China as well as positive performance in many other markets was somewhat offset by continued weakness in Japan.","In China, comparable sales increased 8.8% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of last year\u2019s Avian influenza. Given volatile consumers sentiment in China we\u2019re focused on enhancing our all day value platform to drive traffic and grow market share. At the same time we are building on our strong momentum in breakfast and through brand extensions such as delivery, dessert kiosks and mid-caf\u00e9.","In Australia, affordability remains key to driving traffic with consumer confidence at the lowest levels since 2008. We're strengthening our value proposition by relaunching our Loose Change menu with compelling value offer and we're also making it easier for our customers to enjoy the great tasting McCafe beverages that they have grown to love. ","Negative momentum Japan persisted amid a highly competitive environment and a contracting informal eating out industry. The leadership team remains focused on regaining customer relevance and loyalty by repositioning the affordability platform to resonate more strongly with customers while working to differentiate the McDonald\u2019s experience through menu innovation and a focus on the family and happy meal business.","Around the world markets continue to adjust their plans to be even more relevant to customers but we have recognized again that it will take time to reignite momentum. Overall 2014 is a year of strengthening the foundational drivers of our business, activities that are critical in enabling and advancing our longer-term strategies. Even during periods of softer performance our business continues to generate significant levels of cash. Our first priority regarding use of cash is to invest in our business to drive future growth and future returns. In addition we've established an $18 billion to $20 billion cash return to shareholders target between 2014 and 2015. Year-to-date June, we've returned $2.8 billion towards that goal. ","I want to close by reemphasizing my confidence in McDonald\u2019s. We continue to move forward as one system guided by the framework of our global Plan to Win and relentlessly focused on the significant opportunities that exist within our strategic global growth priorities to optimize our menu by serving our customers\u2019 favorite food and drink, to modernize the customer experience so that it's even more memorable, to broaden accessibility so that we deliver unparalleled convenience and to become an even more trusted and respected brand. ","We're moving forward thoughtfully and with a sense of urgency. Our plans and actions build on our core strengths and I am confident that they will ultimately result in additional business from new and existing customers. Thanks again everyone. I'll now turn it over to Pete. ","Peter J. Bensen","","Thanks, Don and hello everyone. The McDonald\u2019s system and our financial model are built with the expectation of future sales growth. Yet we know from history that our top line growth overtime is neither consistent nor linear. In addition any growth is a product of the significant base off of which we operate which includes serving approximately 70 million customers every day and generating industry leading average unit volumes in virtually all of the countries in which we operate. ","Importantly this large base also provides financial resiliency during periods of softer performance. Though we did not meet our growth targets through the first six months McDonald\u2019s still generated over $4.1 billion of operating income. Our strong financial foundation allows us to remain focused on the significant long term opportunities that we believe McDonald\u2019s is uniquely positioned to seize, which is why we continue our disciplined approach to investing in targeted growth opportunities. ","We know that enduring success requires an ever stronger foundation. So we're pushing forward on multiple fronts guided by our evolved Plan to Win framework and the strategic growth priorities. As Don discussed it takes time to evaluate and align with franchises on the changes needed and then implement them in our restaurants, and time for customers to notice the changes and reward us with increased visits. ","I am confident that we're taking the right steps to strengthen our foundation and position the company for future growth. Our charge over the next 12 to 18 months is to accelerate the changes, effectively communicate the enhancements to our customers and execute at the highest standards in our restaurants. ","Now turning to the results, for the six months ended June system wide sales increased 3% in constant currencies primarily due to expansion. Combined operating margin declined 60 basis points to 29.7% over that same period reflecting the softer results. McDonald\u2019s is primarily a franchisor with over 80% of our global restaurants operated by local businessmen and women. As such franchise margins drive overall profitability comprising approximately 70% of restaurant margin dollars. ","In second quarter, the franchise margin dollars increased 2% in constant currencies while the margin percent declined 60 basis points to 82.2%. Expansion continued to contribute to the margin dollar growth whereas soft comparable sales, increased rent and depreciation expense and the impact of refranchising pressured the margin percent. ","Global company operated margin dollars for the quarter totaled $816 million, a 3 % decline in constant currencies. The margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 17.1 % as relatively flat comparable sales could not offset cost pressures throughout the P&L. Europe's margin declined which I will discuss in a moment, accounted for the majority of the global margin decline. In the U.S., second quarter company operated margins declined 40 basis points to 18.3% due to higher labor and 3% higher commodity costs. As a result of effective risk management efforts and supplier production efficiencies we are maintaining our full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket of 1% to 2%.","In terms of pricing, U.S. is running about 3% at the end of June. This is the midpoint for the full year 2014 projected food away from home inflation of 2.5% to 3.5%. Through June, food away from home inflation stands at 2.2%. So we will be disciplined with future price increases as we move through the second half of the year. In Europe second quarter company operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 18.6%, primarily impacted by higher commodity costs in Russia and Ukraine due to weaker currencies as well as negative performance in Germany. Russia and Ukraine import approximately half of their commodities, most of which are denominated in either Euros or U.S dollars.","For a perspective, Russia and Ukraine accounted for nearly all of Europe second quarter company operated margin decline. Europe's projected full year commodity cost increase remains at 1% to 2%. Excluding currency, commodity costs were relatively flat in the first half of the year which implies a second half increase of about 2%. Our menu price increases in Europe vary by market with the overall segment averaging about 2% year-over-year. ","Turning to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins for the quarter decreased 60 basis points to 13.7% as positive comparable sales were more than offset by higher labor, occupancy and other costs. In addition, new restaurant openings negatively impacted the segment\u2019s margin percent though to a lesser degree than a year ago. The decline in the margin percent was also impacted by the mix of relatively lower margin markets like China contributing a greater share of the overall margin dollars. That being said we are encouraged by the margin percent improvements we are seeing in certain individual markets, including China in this high growth area of the world. ","With our current sales outlook and expected currency volatility in some of our company owned markets we expect continued pressure on consolidated company operated margins in the second half, more significant pressure in the U.S due to higher labor expenses, partly as a result of planned minimum wage increases in several states and likely less benefit from pricing. ","Second quarter G&A expenses increased 3% in constant currencies primarily due to our biannual worldwide convention in April and higher employee costs partly related to our long term growth initiatives. One of our key competitive advantages is our size and scale and our conventionist integral and maintaining alignment so that we could move together as one system. We have reduced our full year projected constant currency G&A increase from 8% to 4% to 5% primarily due to lower incentive-based compensation as a result of not expecting to meet our growth targets.","Even with softer performance the McDonald\u2019s business model continues to generate significant amounts of cash. Our first priority remains at reinvesting this cash in our business to build future returns and enhance shareholder value. These investments are balanced between opening 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants and re-imaging over 1,000 existing locations in 2014. We remain committed to this effort and are making steady progress towards these targets. Through June we've opened 461 new restaurants globally and relative to reimaging we've completed about 90 projects in the U.S, 100 in Europe and 120 in APMEA. Similar to prior year\u2019s new restaurant openings and reimaging projects tend to be more loaded in the back half of the year. ","Lastly let me discuss foreign currency translation which positively impacted second quarter EPS by a $0.01. At current exchange rates we expect minimal impact on third quarter EPS with a full year negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05. As usual please take this as directional guidance only because rates will change as we progress through the second half of the year. ","In closing I remain confident in the choices we're making to position McDonald\u2019s for enduring profitable growth. We're patiently and deliberately making investments to-date to strengthen our foundation and leverage our significant competitive advantages in the $1.2 trillion global and formal eating out category. ","Thanks. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Kathy Martin","","Great, thanks Pete. I am going to open the call for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instructions). So we're going to start with Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer. ","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co.","Thank you very much and good morning. I guess my question here is, how much do you believe your ability to regrow same-store sales of the system is really completely under your control at this point and what I mean by that is you look at your business and your peak sales per unit, really without game changing platforms in the pipe, with competition that's I mean arguably more of a headwind than you've ever witnessed. And so I guess what I am trying to understand from your perspective is what is it really that you can tweak at this point given all these factors. There is really going to be some serious incremenality of this asset base, you talked about better service, improved marketing, getting better practice and I just wonder if that's enough to really continue to try to get incrementality out of a $2.6 million-$2.5 million as has been designed? "," ","Don Thompson","Hi, Brian this is Don, thanks for the question. Brian I think there is two different things that are taking place. If I look at the longer term and you are asking kind of two questions, I think the short and the longer-term. If I look at the longer-term Brian I would tell you the strategic growth priorities that are set for the U.S. business and around the world are solid, very solid and they are really focused on -- let's take the U.S., menu customization and personalization and I mentioned starting with Burger leadership, accelerating digital engagement, actually both the engagement and the experience, so e-commerce is a part of that along with some other things that we're looking at, delivering to our customer base. ","And then enhancing the overall brand relevance and thrust particularly around our food quality and employment opportunity, images and the side of the business that people look to relative to that. So and those things are part of a much broader sustainability movement, if you would in McDonald\u2019s than many people have seen, I feel really, really good about where those strategies are going. Those combined with some of the broader development strategies we've seen in markets like APMEA, those longer-term strategies are solid. ","In the shorter-term what we're looking forward is to fortify the base the foundation of McDonald\u2019s today so that we're ready for those growth opportunities. So to your point as we look at the basic market is strengthening right now. Are we're making sure that the presence that we have, the awareness that we have and share of voice that we have are solid, strong and allocated to the appropriate media, that's being fortified. ","But look at the operational reset in the U.S., it is focused on the peak periods and our ability to deliver at those peak periods, which has something to do clearly with the productivity in the restaurants and the staffing levels in the restaurant and these are things that our leadership operators have discussed in United States with our U.S. team and they are moving forward on those things. ","So supported by breakfast, the food quality messaging the operations focused on the peak periods and staffing scheduling positioning and reasserting market leadership those are foundational pieces. But they have to be re-established Brian. Those to your point are probably more incremental. The other things that I mention are longer term growth strategies are stronger relative to how we look at growth into the future.","Kathy Martin","","Next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Buckingham.","Matt DiFrisco - Buckingham Research","Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit or give us an update on the, the back of the house prep tables in the United States and if we could expect what type of margin benefit at the store level have you seen there, were the benefits you can talk about that as well as any sort of new products that we could see as far as with the extended refrigeration life, what does this enable you to do maybe going down the line?","Don Thompson","Thanks Matt. I'll talk a little bit about you know broader menu pipeline and Pete talk about back of house. Relative to the broader menu pipeline in the U.S. right now they are really focused on the balance between our core products, the core classic favorites, the Big Macs, the nuggets, et cetera and also the new products and new innovation. There are numerous products and ideas that are in the pipeline and in the global pipeline from around the world. Our U.S. team is currently testing some of those and looking at some of those. They are still in the areas that we've mentioned of chicken, beef breakfast and beverages. So if I look at the broader menu of that part is intact. ","The relative to the kitchen and the productivity and efficiency and issues in the kitchen, the high density kitchen was intended to give us more flexibility and allow refrigeration on the prep table which gives us a little bit stronger capability relative to products. You will see -- will have seen a couple of products which you will be seeing more products relative to that but I want everyone keep in mind this is going to be a balanced approach. It is not all new products and not taking care of the core classics and favorites because we need to see baseline improvements in all core products as well as a boost over the baseline based upon the new products that we implement.","Kathy Martin","","Our next question is from Joe Buckley, Bank of America.","Joe Buckley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you. Sort of about broad question you\u2019ve been talking about the global operating environment and certainly operating environment in the U.S has been soft for a couple of years now. And the strategies you are implementing are very execution focused and really haven't changed but also don\u2019t seem to be gaining traction. What sort of we thinking about the next 12 to 18 months from an incremental change that can drive sales? And then secondly does it make sense to keep opening stores at the pace, the current pace of expansion, I guess I'm asking the question globally but especially in the U.S., where I think you have couple of 100 next doors targeted if I'm not mistaken?","Don Thompson","Hi, Joe thanks for the question. Last part first, if you look at the U.S. and you look at a couple of hundred stores keep in mind a large portion of those are relocation base restaurants that we have. So on a percentile basis the U.S. is not opening a lot of stores. We are opening an opportunity and there continues to be market opportunities for McDonald's. But there is not a lot of restaurants in the U.S., I think their number\u2019s about 120 stores net in the U.S. business. ","So the broader development opportunities and growth opportunities across the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa region across markets like Russia, clearly Pete I and the team are looking at some of the markets like the Russias of the world given this the current economic environment and determining what we decide to do Russia, China, what their pace of growth looks like. We do that in an ongoing way. ","In the U.S. the focal point that we have to grow this business is as I mentioned secure the foundational elements of the business. We got to make sure that our restaurants both company-operated and franchise are operating at the right level. So this is not about one side or the other side, this is simply about making sure that the restaurants are running well and if they are staffed effectively. ","Clearly there has been some level of trepidation relative to staffing up our restaurant based upon some legislative impact of things that are coming down the pipe, such as whether it be healthcare reform or the potential of minimum wage from a federal perspective but even more broadly more state minimum wage increases. So there is a little trepidation relative to that but as I mentioned earlier the franchisees with our company team in the U.S. have really had some great discussions around what they call operations reset and are focused on building a business at those peak periods. We understand how profitable that is, across the day parts but we are also not giving up on the growth strategies. ","Those growth strategies around digital engagement, around what we are able to do with our ability to have a balanced menu and to afford customization for our customers then incorporate it with some of the things that we are looking at it doing relative to re-establishing a higher respective brand profile for McDonald's, all those things are going to be well intact and moving forward. So over the next you know 12 to 18 months expect to see focused us on both those parallel paths. In the near term you are going to see more on the foundational piece through rest of 2014 you will see more of the other aspects at some point in 2015.","Kathy Martin","","Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.","David Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to piggy back on the last question and maybe ask from a big pictures perspective why do you think it's taking so long to stabilize the sales trends in places like the U.S. and Germany and I guess part two of the question would be is do you think a need to make more radical changes to the strategy than what you are talking about based on the trajectory of the recovery or maybe lack of recovery that you are seeing?","Don Thompson ","Hi, David. Thanks for the question. I'll speak about this in two different ways. One is I'll give a little update on the priority markets and the other one is really how do we look at, I\u2018ll call it turnaround time. The -- taking the turnaround time piece first, we are clearly moving with a sense of urgency and anyone inside the system knows that and it's quite an aggressive sense of urgency, toward the end of the first quarter, we had priority market business as we had talked about earlier on one of our calls, post that time the market themselves with the franchisees and company employees have been getting together to discuss the local action plans that it takes to drive the business. ","It just so happens in most of these markets those opportunities are around the three areas we've been talking about, around the value\/affordability arena, around the strength and focus of our marketing and how we are marketing with a balance between core and new products and also making sure that as we look at our broader business that we are focused on bringing customers forward and they understand the transparency and food quality levels within McDonald's. So those things are things we\u2019re moving forward aggressively on and markets are putting those plans together. In a franchised organization like ours, it does take some time. As I mentioned the strength of our system is our franchisees, there is no doubt about it. At the same time it takes time to get that alignment and in time to get these things in a restaurant, in time for them to move forward.","So we understand that, we understand the timeline, we want to do it right. I don't want to continue to have implementations that are not consumer-based because then we come back six, 12 months later and we are changing those again. So we are doing these things in the right way with the right processes but it does take some time. The other piece relative to the priority market, just a bit of an update. Different markets will take different times relative to their recovery pace. If you all remember back in early 2000s the UK was a challenging market. It took several years and interestingly enough to focus on similar things that we are talking about now slightly deeper hole at the time, but we've been able to come back with a very balanced approach and we\u2019ve had very strong market success.","Germany today is in that kind of a mode. We got to have a big kind of a recovery. It\u2019s similar to the UK. Japan is in a similar mode as that. I think the U.S is moving forward at a bit more aggressive or stronger quicker pace if you would, however it's still going to take time in the U.S. as we solidify these foundational elements. The Australia, Australia also I think will be at a quicker pace. We are able to still do some innovations in Australia while we fortify some of these base elements. ","In all of these markets we've had some changes in our marketing functions, in our marketing leadership. Some of these markets had changes in our agencies. We've had some other leadership personnel changes in some of the markets. So we believe we are moving forward urgently and aggressively but we are also doing it in a way that will have some longstanding impact and believe me this is not the kind of thing that I'm comfortable about. This is not the kind of thing that I would say I sleep well at night over thinking that the pace of change is as quickly as I would like but I know that the markets are going through this in an appropriate way and an appropriate pace and they are doing it with a sense of urgency.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from David Palmer from RBC.","David Palmer - RBC ","Thank you. It does not look like McDonald\u2019s is descending traffic like it's done in similar periods of low industry growth like '09. You got price increases, I think you said 3% and obviously you are not pounding away on the dollar menu like you did back then. But I know traffic is important to you guys. So when McDonald\u2019s does improve its traffic how do you -- and perhaps it's a '15 event, what do you think would be that driver, the key ingredients for that is -- will it lean on operations changes and digital engagement or perhaps could we see a return to more active food news or something else? Thanks. ","Don Thompson","","David, I think you just hit them but again I'll say that there is parallel paths here. We have to make sure that the foundation is strong enough to accept the digital strategies and engagement that we're going to be putting into the restaurant. The operational foundation has to be strong enough for us to be able to move forward with customization and personalization at the level that we want to at McDonald\u2019s. Back in 2000 -- if you look into 2008-\u201809 time frame this was a slightly different time frame. Several things and I'll mention a couple of them. ","One of them the strength of the broader legislative impact on cash flow was not as aggressive. Having said that what that means is that clearly as a franchisee or a franchisor as we look at the margins there is as I mentioned earlier there has been some trepidation around if you step up then is this going to hurt cash flow even more. ","But I think that the strength of the U.S team with our franchisees is addressing that and beginning to address that appropriately relative to the need for us to do that to move into these growth strategies. So that part is a little bit different. The other thing that is different is that back then we made a modification to the dollar menu which was merely product based and we were able to do that with one product change or at the time we had two product changes over about a five year period. ","At this point we're looking at the overall pricing structure of our menu board because we've seen a bit of a split relative to the lower end of the menu and then the higher end. All of these things the U.S team is looking at as we look at the price tier. So there a couple of differences David nonetheless we're not giving up on value or affordability and I know it's one of the things being implemented in the U.S. business. ","Peter J. Bensen","And David as you think about pricing for the rest of this year, we've said we're up above 3% trailing '12 June but in May we had about 90 basis points of pricing roll off from a year ago and we only replaced that with about 30 basis points pricing. And as we look to that broader food away from home that's projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% but it's only up 2.2% through June. So we're keeping an eye on all those metrics too. So don't think we aren't conscious of what that consumer is feeling today and their ability to come into McDonald\u2019s more often. And yet kind of walking that delicate balance between that aspect of the business as-well-as some of these additional cost pressures that Don mentioned that are coming down the pike. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays. ","Jeffery Bernstein - Barclays ","Great. Thank you very much. Don maybe a follow-up, you talked a lot about the franchise system and how it takes little bit of time to move that system relative to if you owned it yourself. At the same time I think you noted earlier this year the franchisees, based on your meetings with them, your discussions and what not, they are still engaged and supportive of the corporate initiative and I guess you had your convention recently but perhaps that's driven by the fact that profitability is still close to peak levels. But what are the complaints or rumblings you are hearing if any of late, don\u2019t know if any things that management feels the need that we need to prioritize this to address whether it's the new product news, the promotional activity, pricing, remodels. I am just kind of wondering how that sentiment, how those relationships just over the past couple of years the struggles are trending? ","Don Thompson","Thanks, Jeff. Anytime there is softness in cash flow we will have -- we have to have even more effective discussions even more planning together as to how we move the business and there will always be concerns when we see softness in cash flow. This is a for profit business and so that's going to occur. And our franchisees have those concerns as-well-as we do in company operated restaurants. So just to set that stage, we will always have -- when there is a softness in cash flow the conversations we're having now. ","And the franchisees are not -- they are not at all time highs, they have seen higher levels of cash flow. And so they want to get back to some of those levels clearly and we want them back at those levels so they can have personal cash flow but invest in the business and invest in the communities the way that they do. So we have engaged in clearly a lot more conversations and communications around where we take this business. ","The other thing I\u2019ll say though there is a realization that the franchises have they are not seeking and searching for silver bullet either. They understand what they\u2019ve executed in the past to grow the business has been a group of initiatives that have had an impact on multiple fronts. So as we look forward into the future the fact that we\u2019re talking about food and the food experience, the fact that we\u2019re talking about the in-restaurant experience with digital engagement experiences, the fact that we\u2019re talking about how this brand is perceived by consumers and the local communities all of those things fit very well together and I think the franchisees are excited about that. ","Clearly in the current situation and environment there are concerns that the franchisees have. And that is what we\u2019re working through with them but I will say that our leadership groups have been at the table and have been solid relative to the way that they are given input cost and guidance and certainly as they\u2019d like to see us move-in and we\u2019re moving in many of those areas. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo. ","Jeff Farmer - Wells Fargo","Thank you and just shifting gears a little bit, as you guys think about your plan to refranchise I think you said at least 1,500 restaurants by the end of 2016 how should we view that as potential impact on not only that consolidated operating income margin but also your ROIC number and again I just ask that in the context of -- I think we\u2019re all pretty familiar with the margin tailwind that you saw going back to the mid to late 2000s with developmental licensing and things like that in Latin America big margin tailwind, big ROIC tailwind as you look at these group of 1,500 restaurants, how should we think about them?","Don Thompson","Jeff yeah good question thanks. First of all in terms of the -- just the set expectations in terms of the timing, we\u2019ve done about 200 refranchises through this year. When we think about it the next two years \u201915 and \u201916 will probably carry the bulk of that refranchising activity, in part because there are some markets that we really need to build that franchising infrastructure around to get that going in a more significant way. That being said, directionally while we haven\u2019t quantified some of those benefits that you\u2019re calling out directionally those are benefits that we would expect to see to the P&L. ","So we expect franchising does have a favorable impact to our overall combined operating margins. It does have a favorable impact to the G&A levels that we need to support the business. It does have a favorable impact to the ROIIC. So those are all directionally consistent with where we plan to go with this franchising. ","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley. ","John Glass - Morgan Stanley","Don, I see moving with a urgency but around that you must have a set of deadlines internally and some goals and it seems like you\u2019ve pushed this out originally maybe you\u2019re talking about the first half of this year being a reset and then maybe some benefits in the second half now it seems like it\u2019s really going to be pushed off in to \u201915, so what are the milestones specifically that you hope to achieve this year or even next quarter towards those goals? And specifically when are we going to see tangible benefits from both the customization and the digital strategy either it\u2019s this year or it\u2019s \u201915 what is the timeframe for those things?","Don Thompson","Thanks John, the last part, customization and digital strategies we\u2019re seeing certain things in some markets already. So we\u2019ve got, clearly as I\u2019ve mentioned there are some things that we\u2019ve been doing in France, there are some things that we\u2019re already doing in Australia from a test perspective. You\u2019ll see some limited testing in the U.S. the latter part of the year, 2015 again you\u2019ll see more robustness in terms of some of the things that will come to market in 2015. That is not saying that will be January 1st, that is saying that it will be in 2015. ","The aspects around what we\u2019re doing on customization and personalization clearly there are some things that we\u2019re looking at getting going this year relative to testing. It\u2019s a big system getting the operators engaged and I think the U.S. system has begun to do that. So I would say that you\u2019ll see more of that in 2015. That probably is as specific as I would get on that one. I think that we also have if I look across Europe some very similar initiatives, some of the markets as I mentioned UK, Sweden are doing some testing on digital and again we just mentioned France where they are, Australia will be a little sooner on the digital lane, however that's 2015 as we look at that, latter part of '14 you will see some. ","So that kind of gives you the digital perspective. The menu piece and reestablishing our leadership from a menu and marketing perspective, when we talk about milestones, the milestones I have for the priority market, so in Germany we had to reestablish our marketing function, we had to reestablish a more solid and balanced marketing plan and that is what the German team is working through now with the franchisees. ","In Australia they are having some similar conversations and working through that aspect -- the balance between affordability core and the innovative nature of some of the new products. Clearly in the U.S we talked quite a bit about that, there is a sense of urgency, yes there are milestones relative to certain things. I have thoughts about everything from when certain changes occur. We're in the midst of the planning process now and so we're looking at the plans for 2015 as we move forward. ","However we have not given up on 2014. We have a lot of activities now to show off the basis I've talked about and mentioned. So from a milestone perspective believe me they are there, they are aggressive, we talk about them routinely and we see them as we visit the marketplaces. ","What we are mindful of John is the fact that we want to make sure that this is done again, so it has sustaining and staying power, which means in our system this has to be collaborative approach between ourselves and our franchisees. That's when things stay and last within -- in the McDonald\u2019s system. So I feel that it's moving in an appropriate direction. I am impatient as well. Believe me our senior team is, our operators are but we have to do this and do it in the right way so that we have long-term enduring profitable growth and not just a flash in the pan. But these are holistic solutions that will come together and I am confident they will drive the business over the long-term. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank. ","Jason West - Deutsche Bank ","Yeah, thanks. I guess just following up on lot of the other lines of questioning. You guys have obviously not been sitting on your hands in the last couple of years and you are seeing some progress in certain markets but overall some of these trends just seem to be getting worse. So I am just wondering if you feel you like have identified, why the traffic numbers are declining and you have much a better sense of that now than maybe you did a year ago. And yes the learning lab that you mentioned on the West Coast to help understand what customers want, kind of talk about how that's going to help you understand where the traffic is going and how to get people back in the stores? ","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question, Jason. When we talk about our learning lab, we have a learning lab in U.S. [inaudible], we have a digital function over in Europe and France, we had the architecture d\u00e9cor studio also over in France. So we've looked at -- and we have a lot of data on consumers and what consumers are looking for from a trend perspective. When we look at our base trend lines and why they move, where they move, why they would be [right] in these priority markets, we do today have a much better understanding of exactly why. ","We've had a bit of an understanding in the past, however our actions have not coincided with the actual, I would say the data themselves. So when we put actions in place and we've heard some of the actions, what we're doing now is looking at what those consumer expectations are and putting together plans that are directly linked and related to those consumer expectations. That is what we're attempting to do. So this is not chasing short-term sales or short-term guest counts, we're looking to continue to have a sustainability to grew guest count sales and profitability. ","So clearly there are things that we're looking at as we move forward and those are some of the initiatives as I've mentioned as we said on the problem. ","Kathy Martin","Great. The next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein. ","Sara Senatore - Sanford Bernstein ","Hi. Thank you very much. I want to jump over to maybe another part of world, just ask about China because I know you have called it out as a point of strength. It looked like maybe June slowed in China maybe pretty meaningfully. I wanted to ask about that trend and I assume it's unrelated to some of the negatives press we've seen but if you could just comment on both of those dynamics. As-well-as, I think Pete mentioned maybe some there is still a drag on margins from that kind of the lower margin and the mix there. Is that in anyway a function, I think of you having gone after more of a value message or is it just the sort of continued need to kind of scale up to see the margins kind of hit more system wide averages? ","Peter J. Bensen","Sara, it's Pete. I'll start on the margin in the APNEA and Don will talk more broadly about the trends in China. You know our APNEA margins over the next couple of quarters are going to be a little bit misleading because while we are seeing growth in individual countries so, the quarter and end year-to-date we\u2019ve seen growth in the margin in Australia, in China, in Hong Kong our three capital markets in APNEA, the fact that we have refranchised in Australia which is our highest from a capital margin percentage is changing the mix to a lower margin percentage in total and the fact that the Australian dollar is weaker when you translate that in to U.S. dollars that\u2019s giving even less weighting to Australia\u2019s high margins overall. ","So that the segment, virtually all of the segment decline was as a result of these weighting and refranchising combinations. China itself grew margins in the quarter and year-to-date and the drag from the new stores was down significantly from a year ago. Now positive comps are clearly a driver of that but the team you may heard Dave Hoffmann and the team over there talk about the go-to-market strategy which is a very concentrated effort not only in China but in some of our other emerging markets to really look at the cost of opening the new restaurants and challenging the level of investment that we need today or can we build the restaurant with a little less cost today but build in such a way that we can expand it easily in the future when you know sales volumes dictate versus building the restaurant today for a sales volume that we might not achieve until five years from now. ","So a much smarter approach, I would say to the development and we are starting to see some of those benefits already in our margins in China and Don can talk a little bit more broadly about the market.","Don Thompson","Thanks Sara and thanks Pete. Actually in China Sara, our market, the market is performing solidly, quite solidly and I\u2019ll give you a little bit of background, little back drop on China relative to the economy and in our performance which actually if you look at our performance excluding the benefits of Avian influenza for the second quarter it still would have been positive. And over a two year perspective we are growing our business in China, we are growing market share in China, top ten markets, we\u2019re outpacing the competition in terms of growing market share. So we are growing solidly in China. ","The macro-environment is still a challenge, there is fluctuating consumer sentiment and it\u2019s expected to carry over in the quarter. So IO visits are starting to recover a bit but it\u2019s a little bit lower then it was a year ago. I would tell you that despite that some of things we have talked about in some of the other markets actually bode true for China and we made those adjustments. So all day value we went from just a lunch time value to all day value platform, that continues to perform well. Again relative to Avian influenza we are comping on top of what the impact of that was, brand extensions are helping us to move forward. We focus on breakfast in China for the last several years, that continuing to be a positive contributor. Some of these things are even in the face of other initiatives that we implemented, some of the things we focused on with the night business last year. ","So China is actually moving in a positive direction and we feel -- we feel solid about the performance in China. It is still a challenging economy however and everyone should realize that GDP is below 8% and we know what that means. There is still some acceleration in some of the operating related cost leverage of the labor as they look to normalize if you would or redistribute to some of the wealth across China. So everyone grows a bit. But they are still growing on [mobile], we are still growing dry fruits, our sites at the peak points are solid in terms of new sites that we\u2019re opening. ","We culled some of the sites last year because we thought they may have been too early. I think [Kenneth] and the team has done a great job with that. So relative to China we are feeling again that the performance in China is solid.","Kathy Martin","Great. So we have six folks still in the queue. I know we are just about out of time. But we are going to take those six. So for those of you who can stay over for few minutes you know we will carry on. So next question is from Bryan Elliott from Raymond James.","Bryan Elliott - Raymond James","Good afternoon and thanks. Just as you look at the news this week out of China, are we at a tipping point, are you considering potentially backwardly integrating to protect your brand and what really are the solutions to the situation there, from a suppliers standpoint.","Don Thompson","Hi Bryan. You know we have some very solid suppliers across the McDonald\u2019s system and they as we are committed to the highest standards of food safety for our customer. And that's always the number one priority. As we look at some of the alleged issues that are taking place now. If those things, clearly are confirmed at a level that we would think it is a higher level decision that has caused us to have a breach relative to consumer trust we would deal with that effectively, swiftly and appropriately. ","We are no longer serving a product from the primary facility there, that has the challenges and the issues. I know that there is a couple of other facilities that they had, that have been cleared now by the Chinese government, the management thoroughly investigated. We are cooperating fully with the authorities. As you know we do have audits of our suppliers. In this case we do feel that we were a bit deceived relative to one of these plaints. So we are clearly looking at that. ","What does it mean from a broader perspective relative to integration of the supply chain; we enjoy and have benefitted from what we call the three-legged stool which is the supply chain as a separate entity, just as our franchisees are a separate entity other than McDonalds Corporation. They bring us great innovation. They have grown with us in multiple countries around the world, they understand our expectations, they understand where we value consumer safety and our standards and they understand the fact that they would be under scrutiny if there is ever a challenge relative to our consumers.","So we continue to make those points and we continue to drive forward to make sure that we protect our customers and protect the broader brand interest as we move forward on issues like this one.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John Ivankoe - JPMorgan","Hi great, thank you. Just some related U.S. topics if I may, I remember back in 2002 again I think actually using some franchise consultants, you really drove some QSC in the franchisees and either showed them a path to measurable improvement at the store level or showed them a path to exiting the system. So at what point are you kind of like in another phase in terms of kind of getting a 20 year commitment out of franchisees and making sure you have the right people on board with you? And the second kind of I think related topic is around the effectiveness and the efficiency of our advertising and your product development. It does seem to be lagging your peers even a fraction of the size. So I was wondering if there was a structural opportunity to change the effectiveness and the speed to market of that advertising and product development in the U.S. or whether it's just I think as I\u2019ve heard that it\u2019s just about improving executional tactics. Thanks.","Don Thompson","Right, John thanks for the question. Relative to the franchises and John we have a lot of collaboration and committees that are shared between the franchises and the company and our suppliers. So as we engage and address the business we move forward, we are -- we have a lot of communication with each other. One of those points of communications clearly every year is around operating standards of McDonald and what we call growth criteria and also the restaurant operation improvement process which is really focused on quality, food quality, service and cleanliness in the restaurants and we've had a clearly a lot of conversations about how and when and where, and what the processes are for abiding by that. ","We still have those processes in place. Those processes started back to your point in 2001-\u20182 timeframe. They are in place everything from a process for improvement for those restaurants that are not performing at the appropriate levels to how we look at franchise engagement, how we look at our own company operated restaurant performance. So we don't need to have a separate initiative and I think as you talked about it was almost I got a sense of an upper out kind of a conversation. We have ongoing conversation with each other relative to the performance of our restaurants and clearly are we having those now? Yes we are, we have them all the time. ","But what's important is that we focus on the standards and adherence to the standard not some kind of a process to move franchises out of the business. We have a process and frankly based on our improvement processes we tend to be able to improve the business in a different way. We are no more or less aggressive than we were in 2002 at this point in time. It is very similar. ","Relative to marketing, there is a focus on marketing effectiveness. You are absolutely right as we look at shareholder voice, as we look at the impact that our creative has, as we look at the reach that, that creative has and we look at the distribution outlets and our media allocation. Having said that, there is also a focus on how our marketing messages are conveying the emotional quotient if you would of the brand and that means there has to be changes. ","So when I mentioned leadership changes in marketing or agency changes those are not incremental effectiveness changes John, those are changes based upon the fact that we may not be getting the content or the reach or the awareness that we desire and demand as a McDonald\u2019s brand. And when we make those changes we don\u2019t do it lightly. Those are the kind of changes that we need to drive the business and those changes are occurring in several of our critical markets around the world. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from [RJ Hardwe] from Morningstar. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to dive down into Europe a little bit more. Looks like the June results the negative 3.4% comp, little bit softer than what we\u2019ve seen, Europe had recently been a point of relative outperformance. Just wanted to make sure there wasn\u2019t anything more than this just the things you mentioned in Germany between the marketing changes there as well as the Russia situation going on, whether are you seeing competition intensify or seeing less impact from reimagining or some of the menu innovations there, just kind of want to get a better sense of your perspective on Europe. ","Don Thompson","Thanks RJ. I think you hit it pretty well. Germany still remains weak and showed further deceleration in the second quarter. As I mentioned our teams and the franchisees and the changes we\u2019ve made in terms of leadership and process those things are moving forward. It\u2019s going to take a while in Germany. We have lost share in that market. If I look at France and the UK those markets are gaining share and our performance has been solid and we had similar conversations about France several years, could we make the turn and some of the things that we put in place in France has proved [inaudible] on the affordability and we\u2019ve added great balance across the menu in terms of the core product. We\u2019ve has new innovations, we\u2019ve added digital strategies that have been implemented. ","So those things are even in a very-very tough environment our business in France is still providing and so I think it goes to show all the things that we\u2019re talking about are not just things that we dream up but they are the things that we have implemented in the markets around the world. So France is still performing, UK is performing as we mentioned they just last lapped on top of the blended ice rollout but we still have a solid performance there, a very balanced approach to the business and we\u2019re still moving forward and growing. ","There has been one thing we\u2019ve seen a little bit of decline in retail footfall traffic but aside from that, RJ nothing I would say was much broader than that point. Russia slowdown in comp sales there, the economy has recently entered a recession. It\u2019s taking a hit based upon the geopolitical issues, they are paired there. There is lower consumer confidence. ","We have seen some new competitors enter the market but as you know that is a market that we have been in a market that we\u2019re growing in and growing with the right crews and we feel very good about our positioning there and the opportunities in front of us in Russia but at this point there is -- we are seeing some softness in Russia. I think largely due to some of the geopolitical concerns and consumer confidence. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from [Howard Penny from Hagi]. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi thank you very much. Don the last time you\u2019ve gone through an extended period of declining same store sales it took a much bigger event and a major sort of restructuring to get, to realign the organization. I know you put forth the plans to improve sales and you believe I honestly believe that you think you believe you\u2019ve got the right plans but the fact of matter is you might not have the right plan and there could be some give and take and it might not work as you\u2019ve laid it out. Do you have a contingency plan or back-up plan to what might not work or what you put forth today and what are the chances do you think that an extended period of sales will lead to a bigger sort of effort to improve your top line sales? Thanks very much. ","Don Thompson","Thanks for the question, Howard. I know you and I talked recently when we were together at the investor meeting last year, some of the basic fundamental things that we talked about are things that we\u2019re focused on now, to shore up the business clearly. Relative to contingencies, it is the great thing about the McDonald\u2019s system is we are in 119 countries. We have a very diverse portfolio of [witnesses], so we have the opportunity to test multiple things in parts of initiatives in different areas of the world. So when I talk about the digital strategy part of the test was taken place in France. ","What we\u2019re implementing as a result of those learnings in Australia, what subsets of that are being tested in the Sweden, and the U.S. and the UKs of the world, really as we formulate these strategies we\u2019re constantly, I guess you\u2019d say iterating around the improvements in the data that we\u2019ve seen in several markets. So relative to the contingencies I guess I would say it\u2019s almost a live in contingency as to the way that we implement major initiatives. So the digital initiative being one, the customization and personalization efforts being another, even on those it maybe based upon a different product complement. ","So in the U.S it's going to be about Burger leadership, many markets across Europe it will be about that initially. There are other areas where it would be the chicken platforms and portfolios. So we're learning as we go. Outside of focusing -- the things that we're focused on are we know we have to get much better at and they are also areas that we believe great opportunity for us. So the whole notion of the respected brand and our sustainability based efforts and how things play out, not only have we've done some of those historically but most people don't know about them and we have to even get that even more accelerated. So we know that, that's something our customers want and it bodes well relative to our business plan. ","What we're doing around customization and food it goes right at what consumer are asking us for across demographic tiers and so we know they are the right things to do. I would tell you Howard the broader question that is out there now and the broader question that we're answering in the local markets is around what we do to shore up the foundation now even in these environments, even in these economies, even with the other cash flow impact points that maybe out there, how we ensure that together we move to show off the base, so we're ready for the incremental customers that will come and we build up our peak periods and so that kind of is the foundation of it. ","We have to -- your point it's almost an evolving contingency plan. And believe me there are several other areas that we're looking at outside of the ones that I mentioned but those are the ones that we know would be a solid part of our future growth strategy. ","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Keith Siegner from UBS. ","Keith Siegner - UBS","Thank you very much. I'd like to circle back to a question on the consumer insights from earlier and maybe just ask you in a different way especially given how much attention this got at the November Analyst Day last year. Forgetting the plan for a second, just looking at that data that you are collecting which I understand is pretty robust. The customers who aren't coming as much or maybe aren't coming these days, why are they saying that's the case. I mean what are they highlighting and kind of how has that evolved as the year progress. Is it a lack of compelling new news, is helpfulness or quality in general coming up more often, is it the -- what are the folks not coming actually saying in the data? Thanks. ","Don Thompson","Well, Keith that's a big question for a global brand. ","Keith Siegner - UBS","Just the U.S. ","Don Thompson","If you look into U.S., there are several things that we see in the U.S. You all know that the QSR industry as a whole is soft in the U.S. There are a lot of things that are out there in the U.S. right now ranging from as I've mentioned some of the legislative matters that are on the board relative to impact of healthcare next year, potential minimal wage changes, what happens relative to the immigration reform cost particularly around [inaudible]. There are challenges and changes relative to legislation in terms of whether or not there will be re-ups on some of the tax credits, tax benefits. So there are a lot of things that our franchisees are looking at relative to cash flow. ","That is one of the things that then flows through relative to execution in the restaurant. When we first began operations reset we were hearing some customers at the restaurants were getting too complicated, it was a little confusing on the menu boards. We needed to get some level of simplification. I would say at the same time we're saying and customers are saying we want a little more customization or personalization but we want some different taste. We want some different condiments, the U.S. is moving forward with the high density kitchen and prep for that. ","We're also hearing that there are some consumer confidence related concerns around discretionary spending. In the U.S. we see a bifurcation based upon what's taking place in markets that are greater than $75,000 from an overall income perspective and those that are less than say $45,000. These are two different worlds today. Those markets at the higher end discretionary spending are still flowing fairly well, markets at the lower end it's a little bit tighter. ","The geographic positioning of McDonald\u2019s around the U.S. is broad and so we're in both of those sub markets and pretty good distribution. That's a little different than some of our competitor set. So clearly the economy is a bit of a concern and we're hopeful that the economy will continue to improve and that improvement will be across all segments. But we also have to make sure that we're thriving in this environment, so having the right affordability messaging which maybe slightly different in some of these markets than it is in others. ","Kathy Martin","All right. Our last question is from Paul Westra from Stifel. ","Paul Westra - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","","Great. Thanks. Very similar question to Keith's about the U.S business. Maybe talk a little bit about more if you could about the weakness perhaps in the overall U.S. QSR category and specifically do you sense any incremental competitive challenges coming from the convenient store business which you mentioned before and the low end perhaps and perhaps quick casual on the high end. I know this year emphasis is on the increasing frequency of the base business and perhaps base consumer, the ones have stabilized perhaps talk a little bit about the more intermediate term opportunity or product line expansions maybe -- or maybe regain some share from these lower end and higher end categories?","Don Thompson"," ","Yeah, Paul. I would tell you that several years ago we began to have conversations just around broader market segments and sets and what we were seeing. I would tell anyplace a person can stop we view as a competitor whether it\u2019s a petrol station or it\u2019s a convenience store, it\u2019s a grocery store, ready to eat food or take home food we view the whole set a competitor. As we look at our business when you got that many places that you can view as a competitor what you have to focus on is what you are good at and what you know you can excel at and differentiate. ","We know that the speed of service at McDonald's, the accuracy of the service, the food quality even in our segment which is a quick service restaurant segment are critically important. The transparency of our food and the fact that we know that we have very high quality food at McDonald's is one of the messages that I think we have to get out even stronger and it\u2019s one of the things that the overall quick service industry has struggled with for years and years and years. And so we believe that some of things that we have talked about from many personalization, customization high density kitchens, highlighting some of the condiments on the prep table those things also help us, but it also had to be spread throughout our marketing and our awareness campaigns, those are the things that we are focused on and make sure that those things take place. ","You know as you look at food away from home right now we know that the food away from home industry is one of that is still increasing albeit about a two percentile rate, interestingly enough food at home is 2.4% increase. So they\u2019re all in the ball park of normalization I guess I call it normal inflation at this point in time. If one of those shoots up or down we have to take note of it relative to what that meets to our affordability platforms. If the economy gets better or worse we have note of that relative to what impact it may have on our breakfast business. So, there is a lot of things we look at. I couldn\u2019t give you Paul you know super specifics on any one item but there is a lot of things we have to look as we mentioned in the business particularly in the U.S. and go forward.","Kathy Martin"," ","Okay, thanks. And we are going to go right into Don\u2019s closing comments.","Don Thompson","","Thank you all very much. We wanted to take a little extra time because we know you have questions, interest relative to the McDonald's business. I want to thank all of you for joining us this morning. We remain committed as you can tell to the Plan on Win and our strategic growth priorities as we work to strengthen the key foundational elements of our business and I have mentioned how critical those are. We know that we can drive our business through the growth initiatives that will enhance our customers relative to the field. We are seeing that in some of the markets around the world. Those initiatives and implementations will be broader as we move forward. ","Our defensible competitive advantages, our resilient business model, the communications and alignment that we strive for and have with owner operators, our suppliers and company teams, those things give me confidence that as we execute our plans to drive profitable growth for our system we will be successful and our shareholders will reap the benefits of that over the long-term.","So thanks again for joining us this morning.

Broad based momentum across our markets resulted in a 5.9% increase in global comparable sales for the quarter and our 17th consecutive quarter of global comp sales growth. This was complemented by gains in global guest counts.","Across every country function and level in our system we're seeing improving discipline and robust levels of execution that are guided by our velocity growth plan. Performance that is punctuated by culture that is embracing and leveraging innovation across every facet of our business.","Every quarter, I spend several weeks visiting restaurants and speak with franchisees and market leaders around the world. I come away from these visits inspired by how our actions resonate with customers, never more so than today when our global economy presents many economic, social and political challenges and uncertainties.","Across markets, our success follows a consistent formula; for the customer-first, strive to understand their needs and desires, and constantly find ways to improve their experience. Then empower our people to pull the levers that create delicious, feel-good moments for customers every visit every day.

Run effective value strategies rooted in deep customer insights and provide outstanding customer experience by running great restaurants. And finally, layer in initiatives to accelerate and sustain growth.","Visiting markets this quarter, in St. Petersburg I saw examples of how the team is pulling velocity growth plan levers across Russia. In a tough economic environment we're meeting customers' needs for taste, quality and value.

Our Russian customers have taken notice we're serving more guests and delivering a better experience in our restaurants.","In Portugal, we're seeing balanced growth across all day parts and all menu platforms.

Our partner brings strong local leadership, a passion for our brands, greater insight at a local level and financial strength to invest in a purposeful roadmap for growth.","Finally, in Japan, where an aging population, declining labor force and softening consumer confidence are combining to create unique market pressures our team has made strong gains by offering menu items that tap into local tastes, table service that resonates with guests and continued promotion of our digital capabilities, we've grown comp sales in Japan for the last four years.","Across global markets, we're serving up a prudent formula that signals to our customers we care about them.","In my visits with franchisees across the U.S., it's clear to me that excitements return into the system with execution of Bigger Bolder Vision 2020, the ambitious plan we build with our franchisees. Average franchisee, restaurant cash flow is moving in the right direction with 11 consecutive months of cash flow growth through September. We expect this trend to continue through the rest of 2019.","During the quarter, I spent time with next generation franchisees. These are children or grandchildren of franchisees who grew up in the McDonald's system and as adults share a long term perspective on McDonald's proud heritage.","In Minneapolis and Louisville, as in global markets, they are executing the velocity growth plan formula successfully. They're running great restaurants, capturing the benefit from growth initiatives and anticipating new ways to best serve our customers and crew in the future.","Across the U.S., we're getting back to basics with the goal of running fast and friendly drive-thrus. We're providing tools in the kitchen to help prepare our food fast and with the highest quality standards; running national drive-thru challenges which have resulted in improving speed of service; deploying new technology like drive-thru timers, which are now installed in 60% of the U.S. system to ignite crews' competitive spirits and making bold decisions to reduce the complexity of our menu.","And it's working. Thanks to these and other efforts we're seeing continued operational improvements. Customer satisfaction scores reaching all-time high in quarter three and seconds at that drive-thru have dropped by double digits year-over-year.","Now, let me turn it over to Kevin for a deeper dive into our performance around the world.","Kevin Ozan","We're pleased with our continued top line growth momentum. As Steve said global comp sales increased 5.9% for the quarter and each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. We also grew global guest counts.","In the US, we delivered another strong quarter of sales growth. Comp sales were up 4.8% despite the increased competitive environment. While US traffic was negative for the quarter and remains our biggest opportunity, we benefited again from a healthy average check increase, driven by both product mix changes and menu pricing.","Our iconic core menu continues to fuel results from the fresh beef QPC and QPC deluxe line extension to core items featured in the buy-one-get-one-for-$1 national promotion. Our customers are showing us that our investment in fresh beef is paying off as we continue to grow burger share.","Additionally, our worldwide favorite's promotion that launched in quarter two and carried into quarter three resonated well, and customers especially loved the strip waffle McFlurry. The sales benefit from our modernized restaurants also contributed to our overall US comp performance for the quarter. We've converted about 1500 restaurants to EOTF this year, and remain on track to complete about 2000 projects by year end. The US now has over 9000 EOTF restaurants or roughly two thirds of the US estate.","Turning outside the US, the international operated market segment once again delivered strong balanced results. Comp sales were up 5.6% with every one of the markets growing comp sales for the quarter and nearly all of the markets also growing guest counts.","The UK, which delivered its 54th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth continues to gain market share across nearly all day parts despite an increasingly competitive marketplace, and declining consumer confidence. The market's performance was highlighted by a promotional food event, featuring double Quarter Pound burgers and spicy McNuggets along with growth in delivery, driving record high monthly sales and guest count volumes in the quarter.","France, marked its 10th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all time high market share. The market is successfully accelerating on premium and core burgers, a continued focus on their value platform and family business and delivery expansion.","Germany, also marked its 10th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth. The quarter benefited from strong value messages and mobile offers along with maximizing contributions from EOTF.","Looking at the international developmental license markets, which is now our largest segment by restaurant accounts, comp sales were up 8.1%. Each geographic region grew both comp sales and guest counts with Japan, China and Brazil as the largest contributors to the segment's performance.","I recently visited Latin America and had the opportunity to meet with Arcos Dorados our strategic DL partner. Arcos has expanded McDonald's footprint across the region by opening new restaurants and they're also making great progress on modernizing existing restaurants to EOTF. Using local expertise and innovation, Arcos is successfully executing their strategy of delivering an enhanced customer experience, providing the most relevant menu offerings and running great restaurants, despite the geopolitical and economic challenges they face.","Now I'll turn it back to Steve to further talk about the growth accelerators driving our business.","Steve Easterbrook","As we've shared on prior calls, we're moving with purpose to bring the biggest benefit to the most people in the shortest possible time. This means taking bold actions designed to serve more customers tomorrow than today.","Historically, we've achieved sustained compounding growth when we offer new customer experiences on top of a strong base of operational performance. When we launched our velocity growth plan in 2017, we committed to three such new customer experiences, which we call our growth accelerators; experience the future, digital, and delivery. That all about giving customers more control over how they order, how they pay and how they receive their food.","In a short period, we've moved from deployment to real business impact with each of these accelerators. Through our EOTF deployments, we've created more inviting dining environments, easier and faster ordering, and greater hospitality with guest experience leads focused on serving our customers' needs. These efforts are clearly connecting with guests.","With digital, we're working hard to fulfill customers' desire through simpler, smoother and more personal engagement over our digital platforms, including kiosks drive-thrus and our mobile app. Now here was the power of our emerging digital ecosystem on display during the third quarter than in China. The market drove strong comp sales growth, in part by delivering tangible members-only benefits to our digital community, which now stands at 100 million registered members.","Additionally, we benefit from the halo effects of promoting delivery to our growing digital network. We continue to move quickly to deploy dynamic yield, which technology improves our ability to offer customers what they're likely to want, using machine learning to make suggestions based on time of day, weather and popular menu items. The business case is driving rapid adoption. Dynamic yield technology is now in over 9500 U.S. drive thrus with full rollout to nearly every US restaurant with an outdoor digital menu board expected by year-end.","And we're just getting started. Deployment across our existing drive thru restaurants in Australia will be complete by year-end. And we're scoping future deployment for additional markets and applications, eventually including kiosks and our global mobile app. Ultimately, dynamic yield will facilitate a range of personalization benefits, where we can leverage knowledge of the customer, and order patterns to provide a tailored experience in restaurants, at the drive thru and on our app.","Another milestone on our journey to embrace technology to provide simpler, smoother and more personal customer engagement over our digital channels is the creation of McD Tech Labs, which was fueled by our acquisition of apprentice. Our new team based in Silicon Valley brings first mover advantage and a must-with-area for our system voice technology. Apprentice talent and technology comes with the promise of more efficient and accurate ordering at the drive thru and a better experience for our customers.","At the same time, we expect the technology to reduce complexity for our crew. Whether we look across the tech or consumer world we see voice technology playing an increasing role in all our lives. For McDonald's, this is particularly significant because the importance of drive-thrus to our portfolio. Delivery is another area where we've moved rapidly to capture changing consumer habits around service and convenience. Once again, customers are responding, in fact they're now placing 10 McDelivery orders per second on average globally. So whilst we're on this call, customers will likely place 36,000 McDelivery orders.","For 2019, we expect delivery to drive $4 billion or roughly 4% of global system wide sales. That's up from $1 billion just three years ago. And it's now available from about 23,000 restaurants in over 80 countries. Of note our McDelivery global average check remain steady at two times the average restaurant check. Year-over-year, we continue to see double digit or higher McDelivery comp sales increases across many of our major markets.","In the U.S., we saw an increase in average restaurant McDelivery orders in the restaurants where we recently introduced DoorDash as an additional delivery partner. This result is consistent with our experience in other markets. The addition of multiple delivery partners in markets such as Italy, Canada, Russia, and Spain help these markets reach new customer pools by appealing to customers primarily loyal to other apps, and expanding coverage to geographies where existing partners may not have had a presence.","As we add new delivery partners globally to reach new customers, we're also keeping pace with an evolving delivery ecosystem. Delivery remains a big frontier for our business and we still have a long way to go even with our existing customers to encourage awareness and trial.","This year, over 50 markets participated in our third annual celebration of McDelivery, themed McDelivery Night In doubling the number of participating markets from last year. McDelivery Night In generated a 25% plus global McDelivery sales lift that Thursday. A halo effect on the following day drove the most ever delivery orders on a single day for us.","As we prioritize awareness and trial, we are encouraged by data showing that new or lapse users accounted for a significant portion of the global sales lift. We still have a lot of work ahead of us but we're moving forward with great speed, energy and excitement within McDonalds. We are confidence there's plenty of road ahead for success with McDelivery.","Now, I'll turn it back over to Kevin for a deeper dive into the financials.","Kevin Ozan","In prior quarters, I've talked about the franchising we've undertaken to stabilize our business model. The capital, we're investing in EOTF alongside our franchisees to modernize our restaurants and the additional technology investments we are making to grow the business. I also discussed earlier this year that these strategic moves have created some short term financial headwinds, like lower gains on sales of restaurants, and higher depreciation and G&A expenses.","As we're setting up our business for long term growth, I want to take a minute to put our strong operating results for the quarter in perspective. We grew global comp sales by nearly 6%. We grew system wide sales by 7% in constant currencies. That's well over a $1.5 billion of growth across the system. We grew constant currency revenue across each of our operating segments for the second consecutive quarter.","Our franchise margin dollars were $2.5 billion growing $150 million for the quarter or 6% increase in constant currencies. We achieved an operating margin of 44% and EPS for the quarter was $2.11, with growth in margins being offset by lower gains on restaurant sales and a higher tax rate. This performance reflects the strength and stability of our business model, as well as the ongoing actions we're taking to position our business for sustained long term profitable growth.","In addition, consolidated company operating margins increased 20 basis points to 18.6% for the quarter. US company operating margins increased 280 basis points to 15.6%, benefiting from comp sales growth and improved operational performance. IOM company operating margins declined 60 basis points, but we're still a healthy 21.3% as continued labor and commodity pressures more than offset comp sales growth.","In the US, third quarter pricing was up nearly 3% while commodity costs increased about 2%, primarily due to higher beef costs, we still expect the full year US grocery basket to be up about 2% to 3%.","Turning to G&A. Steve mentioned earlier that we're committed to investing in our business for the long term. As we become more efficient with our day-to-day G&A to run the business, we're choosing to invest in technology and R&D, such as our acquisitions of Dynamic Yield, Apprente. The creation of McD Tech Labs, and an increased focus on back of the house efficiencies for our restaurants.","Our year-to-date G&A spend is up 1% in constant currencies, and given our strategic investments, we expect full year G&A to be up about 1% to 2%. Our effective tax rate was 25.3% for the quarter, and we expect our full year tax rate to be relatively similar.","Foreign currency translation negatively impacted our third quarter results by $0.03 per share, given the continued strength of the US dollar. Based on current exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to negatively impact Q4 earnings by $0.01 to $0.03, which would result in a full year headwind of $0.20 to $0.22 cents. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.","And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved an 8% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5 annually. This marked the company's 43rd consecutive year of delivering a dividend increase for our shareholders and reinforces our confidence in the company's long term strategy. Through third quarter, we returned a cumulative $22.5 billion against our three year cash returns shareholders target of about $25 billion, which will be completed this year.","Steve Easterbrook","As we talk about change and embed a culture of innovation and how we work is important to connect these efforts to our iconic global brand. For over 60 years, the strength of the McDonald's brand has been our ability to offer a compelling menu of delicious and affordable food made with high quality ingredients, and complementing that with hospitality and convenience for our guests.","An integral component of that brand magic is meeting consumers on their terms, in places where they congregate, whether it would be in small towns or urban centers, on the sidelines of work or play or on the various other places where communities come together. A brand on its essence is a promise and our promise has largely remained unchanged over the years.","What has changed are the ways in which we fulfill that promise. The world is different than it was in 1955. Different today, even it was four years ago, when we launched our turnaround. We're keenly aware that we have to be out ahead of these changes, investing, executing and growing with a deep sense of urgency and purpose.","Our strong performance in the third quarter and over the past 17 quarters didn't happen in a vacuum, is the result of our people firmly committed to our velocity growth plan, and the culture of innovation that is driving that plan.","That culture of innovation is rooted in a relentless focus on the customer experience, making the jobs of our restaurant employees simpler and more rewarding, and building an operational foundation for long-term growth and competitive success. Operational and marketing innovations have been embedded into our DNA since the opening of store number one Des Plaines, Illinois.","Each time we innovate collectively with our franchisees and supply chain partners, whether by founding Hamburger University in 1961, introducing the Big Mac in 1968, opening the first drive-thru in 1975, introducing extra value meals in 1991, launching all day breakfast in 2015 or accelerating delivery in 2017, we plant seeds that result in sustained growth for our business. Indeed, it is through this approach that we've been able to grow guest counts, strengthen our three legged stool of employees, suppliers and franchisees and build an enduring brand for the legacy of sustainable growth.","This is not to say our company and our industry going to face challenges ahead. We have before and we will again. But by having the right people in the right places, supporting them with resources and investments they need and embedding a culture of innovation to how we work, we know we can deliver on our brand promise in any environment and sustain the growth trajectory, which has defined this business for over half a century.","With that said, let's begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","MikeCieplak","Our first question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.","EricGonzalez","Hey, thanks for taking the question. You have a large hamburger competitor announcing its intention to enter the breakfast day part with the big ad campaign and promising to drive a 10% sales mix almost immediately. I was just wondering, if you can comment or discuss your thoughts on how that might impact the industry in 2020? And if you see the industry shifting, again towards heavy discounting in the morning?","And I recognize you might not want to give too much away, but if you could comment on how you see this playing out among your competitors, as they try to protect its share, it will be really helpful? Thanks.","SteveEasterbrook","Thanks, Eric. Steve, here. By the way, apologies to everyone if I'm coughing a little bit through this call, I'm just a bit under the weather at the moment. But yes, so breakfast is a competitive day part, I mean, we've seen competitors ramp up their activity during this year as well actually. So having another entrant in next year will just ensure that market share fight remains as competitive as ever.","I'm not sure if it's really going to be anyone's huge best interest to have it too much value or discount led. But it is an important day part for us to protect and grow. I think for us, we are encouraged this current quarter, because breakfast has been a little behind the rest of the day's performance until this quarter, and we've seen our breakfast sales growth, pretty much in line with the sort of sales growth we are seeing across the rest of the day.","So I think that gives us encouragement that the actions that many of our local coops are taking to fight this on a local level and beginning to get some traction. So -- but we operate in a competitive market, whether it's breakfast or all rest of day. So we\u2019re used to fighting for our share and we'll carry on doing that for next year for sure.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","AndrewCharles","Great. Thank you. Kevin, you talked about year-to-date SG&A growth of roughly 1% with 4Q implied obviously step up to make the full year guidance of 1% to 2%. And I guess just given the accelerating exit rate of G&A in 2019 and the creation of McD Tech Labs to evaluate future technological opportunities. How should we think about what this means for 2020 G&A with street broadly has you pegged at flat G&A dollars?","KevinOzan","Yes, thanks, Andrew. So as I mentioned, our full year spend is expected to be up 1% to 2%, we're up basically 1% through year-to-date. So obviously, you can do the math for fourth quarter. But, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are more efficient on our day-to-day G&A, we're choosing to invest in certain areas of technology and R&D, Dynamic Yield, Apprente, McD Tech Labs, and back in the house some efficiencies that are increasing the G&A certainly slightly this year. And my expectation is that the G&A would be higher in 2020 than is in 2019, mainly because as you know, our acquisitions of both the Apprente and Dynamic Yield happened midyear this year. So we'll have kind of full year impact of those in 2020.","I'd say we believe these investments are really important to help set us up well for long term growth. And so we believe that the right thing to do, as you know over the last several years, we've lowered our G&A, both in absolute dollars as well as significantly as a percent of sales. As a perspective in 2014 G&A was 2.8% of sales, this year will be about 2.2% of sales.","And really what we're focused on is driving growth and operating margin. And our belief is that we're going to have to spend some money in order to be able to drive operating margin that certainly has grown significantly, again from about 29% to 30% back in 2014 to mid-40s now. So you should expect the G&A will be a little higher in 2020 than is in '19. But to us, it's really about driving top line and bottom line growth.","SteveEasterbrook","Just to hook on that as well. I think if we take Dynamic Yield as an example, clearly, we've absorbed the incremental G&A that comes with the acquisition. I think part of how we challenge ourselves here is to generate the return on that investment as fast as you can. And I think we've been encouraged by the fact we have the Dynamic Yield technology now in 9500 drive-thrus in the US.","And we're pretty much rolled out across the entire Australian system as well now. And with other of our larger international markets lining up. So we think it's -- we challenge ourselves in terms of being physically responsible, but growth is kind of the primary driver of all of our ambition. And I think these investments are enabling that for sure.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Katie Fogertey with Goldman Sachs.","KatieFogertey","Great, thank you. You guys started to test out the beyond plant based burger in Canada. I'm wondering, as you saw the quarter unfold did you guys think that not having a meatless burger was a headwind to your sales? How are you thinking about that opportunity here? Thanks.","SteveEasterbrook","We're interested in this clearly. We've taken the plant based product to Ontario, Canada. We've got 28 restaurants now. We only launched it with a couple of days of the quarter to go. So very early days. Clearly, there's been competitive activity, which you will all be aware of, which I'm sure has helped create some more immediate interest or some shorter term, certainly response, consumer response. I guess what we're interested in is really how best to position this, get a sense of the, as they call it them the Flexitarian customer really what is their appetite for this, no pun intended, but would it drive incremental visits, is it option just to switch out from time to time.","We want to get the taste right. We want to get the marketing right. We want get the operations right. So there's a number of important factors that we're learning quickly. And we think Ontario's a great spot because it will give us a good read across North America frankly, but also into the developed markets in Europe as well. So we think the read across will be beneficial and help us speed up our intelligence on this. So more to come clearly. But it's an area of interest for sure.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","SaraSenatore","Hi. Question about technology spend. And then just a quick clarification on what Kevin just said. First, I guess you're spending a lot of money on technology as you pointed out. And certainly makes sense to leverage scale to make these investments. But our sense is that a lot of your competitors, at least in the U.S. are doing, are also doing well perhaps without as much of an investment and to your point about traffic. So a little bit of a headwind for you.","So I guess, how do we have confidence that, the amount that you're spending or the magnitude is the right amount that it isn't perhaps too much or that there is an ROI on this over time.","And then just a clarification wise, Kevin, you mentioned you want to see growing margin rate. So it sounded like you - or growing margin, it sounded like you were talking about rate as opposed to margin dollars. So should we expect margin rate to continue to expand from here? Thanks.","KevinOzan","Yes. Let me start with the last one first, take care of that one, and then I will come back to the tech spend. When I talk about operating margin, I was talking about kind of the mid 40% range. But certainly you should expect that operating margin dollars will grow.","Just as a perspective, if I think about kind of our restaurant margin dollars through year to date, through September, we've grown restaurant margin dollars, about $450 million in constant currency. So you should expect that our ambition is to continue to grow those margin dollars as we continue on. And our expectation is to continue growing those margin dollars.","Some offset to that will be G&A, obviously. And as I mentioned, we think G&A will go up some in 2020, but certainly not anywhere close to offset growth and margin dollars, which should mean that our expectation is that operating margin dollars would continue to grow.","Relating to tech spend, I'll say a couple things. And then if Steve wants to chime in, he's certainly welcome. It's an interesting question, but I don't know how to prove to you or convince you, let's say that we're spending exactly the right amount. I'd say a couple of things. One, I think we have certainly proven internally and hopefully externally, that we have put discipline around our G&A processes, and that we are investing in things that are driving growth for the business. As Steve mentioned, the way we look at our spend is to determine what kind of return we expect to get on that spend. And that helps drive a determination of what we will spend.","We were, as you know, certainly a couple of years ago, a little behind on our technology spending so that we did have to spend some in the last couple years. I'll say just to get infrastructure and things set up the right way.","And then finally, I'd say our intent is to set ourselves up for sustainable long term growth. And that's why we're investing in technology today. Our belief is those who aren't investing in technology, at some point will be behind and will need to catch up. And we'd rather be a little bit ahead of the curve and spend the right amount that we think will drive future growth.","SteveEasterbrook","And I just pull that I think the part of the performance that we're showing, say through 2019, is a result of some of the technology spend that we've invested the last two to three years. And if I was a backtrack, say four or five years, the majority of our tech spend was backup house type spent just to keep the restaurants operating. That we've really got much more consumer facing. So that's kind of a new era to spend for us. But we begin to see the results that we want. As we see the cell phone or kiosk usage increase around the world, we see the average check growth that comes with it.","As we invest in the outdoor digital menu boards, and then you can plug in, dynamic yield capabilities, we start to see, again, average check growth come from there. Or even just as simple as getting our infrastructure setup to enable us to meet home delivery, for example. And now integrating those apps into our global mobile app. This all takes investment, but it either makes you see the driving visits or driving check, but it's also driving some efficiencies. But it's not always about acquisitions either. So obviously, we've made a couple of acquisitions this year, which clearly gives us an incremental G&A, which we just spoke about.","But again this is also just ongoing investment, through our innovation center around modernizing the equipment stack, if you like and getting that kind of ecosystem functioning more effectively to help our management crew run the restaurants better. So I would say some of the proof points are out there already. But we're excited about continuing to drive efficiencies through technology and also grow through technology. So more to come.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore.","DavidPalmer","Thanks. Good morning. Question on earnings. Obviously 2019 is not going to be a year of earnings per share growth, but there's been significant drags in there, lease accounting tax rate, G&A step ups, currency, maybe seven plus points of drag and all those things to all together. You mentioned G&A being somewhat higher for 2020. But just thinking about what you should do in 2020, in terms of earnings versus that high single digit algorithm?","What are some gives and takes aside from G&A that we should be thinking about? And then on free cash flow, is your CapEx outlook still the same with your CapEx dropping from about $2.3 billion in '19 to about half that by 2023? Thank you.","KevinOzan","Thanks, David. Okay, let me try and going through all of that. So, regarding 2020, I guess let me first say this, we still have strong belief in our long-term algorithm and target. So I'll start with that. Regarding 2020, if I think about this year just to put this year in perspective that obviously leads into 2020. Year-to-date again September right now, we've put up a 5.9% Global comp, 5% in the US, 7% system wide sales growth in constant currencies.","And as I mentioned to Sara's question, that has resulted in about $450 million of restaurant margin growth in constant currencies year-to-date. We do have higher G&A this year because of the dynamic yield apprentice. We will have higher G&A next year because of those as well as just the amortization of some of the tech investments we\u2019ve made.","As I think about the gives and takes, the other couple things will be this year we\u2019ll have nearly $200 million lower of restaurant gains. We will likely have some lower gains even next year, certainly not to the extent of this year. We will have continued incremental EOTF depreciation, again, not to the level of this year's increase, which was roughly or a little bit over a $100 million dollars on franchise margins. We don't expect the incremental to be as much in 2020, but we will still have some incremental depreciation on those.","So that's some of the pieces. What I would say is, we feel good about -- well, let me go to CapEx first, I guess. CapEx as you mentioned, it'll be roughly $2.3 billion this year, roughly similar amount next year, and then it should fall bit below $2 billion after that. So that regardless of that we believe that free cash flow will continue to grow year upon year. That's how our model shows it right now.","And I'd say based on our algorithm, and the way we've looked at it. I feel good about the business model. I feel good about our ability to grow margins and drop back to the bottom line. I certainly feel good about our strategy. And I feel good about the investments we're making in technology and R&D that we think will help set us up well for long-term growth.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","JohnGlass","Thanks very much. If I can just come back to maybe the current quarter in the US and the comps which is 4.8, were strong, but they weren't as strong as the prior quarter at least and you've got building EOTF momentum. You talked about dynamic yield, you talked about expanding your aggregator networks, so all those would point to better results. And they were slightly softer, at least sequentially.","So what were the offsets? Where are you seeing, how did traffic fare relative to last quarter? I think you were sort of optimistic traffic was a little better last quarter, but maybe it wasn't sustainable. So was it being just a relapse then to normalization? A little more color on what changed in the business third quarter in the U.S. versus the prior quarter?","KevinOzan","Yes. I'll start and then I will let Steve chime in just so he can save his voice a little bit. Traffic for the third quarter, I'll say there wasn't a meaningful change in traffic trends in the third quarter for the U.S. versus the first couple quarters. So it's still negative. As I mentioned, it's still our largest opportunity, but not a meaningful change in trend in the third quarter versus second quarter.","You will recall as we mentioned on our second quarter call, we had a couple benefits in second quarter, one related to the timing of Easter holiday, one relating to some promotional activity we had related to Filet O Fish that helped second quarter I'll say be a little bit above trend, if you will.","So third quarter -- if you think about two years stacks, third quarter is relatively similar to first quarter. And the other thing I'd say related to within the quarter, because I know there's been some chatter out there about how the quarter got weaker for us as the quarter went on. All three months were relatively similar in terms of comp sales. So each month was between a 4.5 and 5.5 comp. So it's not like -- it's not like the worlds fell off in August or September or anything like that.","And the other thing I would say is, there is certainly was some competitive pressure mid-August, probably through mid-September. That seemed to lessen as we ended the quarter. So I think all of those factors kind of impacted our net result in the order. As you mentioned, EOTF, is a benefit -- third quarter benefit was relatively similar to second quarter benefit. And I would expect that to be similar in the fourth quarter before it starts leveling off for next year.","SteveEasterbrook","I think the only thing I would add is if we kind of drill into our detail of points ones here and points one there. Some of the work we've done on simplifying our menu as I mean we've had a little bit of resistance when we move away from say signature crafted.","Now the flip side is helping us run better restaurants and we saw our drive-thru service times in the U.S. improved by around 20 seconds across the quarter year-on-year. So I think we're still making the right decisions for the long term. But Yes, there's going to be a little bit of short term resistance when you simplify the menu. So little bits and pieces but no fundamental shift in momentum.","I mean, it really was balanced sales growth across day parts and across the menu, actually, which I think is what's giving us confidence. And some of the accelerator initiatives that we've launched are delivering consistently the sorts of performance that we've shared with you in the past.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan.","JohnIvankoe","Hi, thank you. Actually a follow up on that as well. You obviously mentioned improving drive-thru times, which is obviously important in record guest satisfaction scores. I mean, these are things that would normally have driven a positive traffic comp, for McDonald's, maybe in the past.","The comments that you made on franchisee store level cash flow. 11 months, I think, a positive year-on-year cash flow. How much of that was due to some of the changes that you made, from a promotional perspective. And, what's the post mortem on giving more of the value back to some of the local partners?","Are you in the place where you think you're optimizing profitability and traffic? Or might there be kind of a shift in balance, if you will in 2020 where we might see more value in words to drive traffic maybe into some extent, at the sake of profitability?","SteveEasterbrook","Yes John, it's. Actually it is that delicate balance, so I mean, to get the consistent top-line growth, and having profitable growth for our enterprise is clearly critical. We want that drives their motivation and drive their confidence, it drives their ability and willingness to keep reinvesting in the initiatives as we've identified.","But we don't want to give up customers. And it's fair to say that the guest count declines we do see. There's a couple of things I'll share with you. One is the lower average check level. So clearly there is a value component in there and it's just a case of how do we address that? Is that more of a local level? Is it a national level? I don\u2019t know, our U.S. team's working through that.","Another way we've cut and diced this is across the US we have 56 co-ops. And if we look at the fourth quarter the most challenged performing co-ops. See clearly 25% of our cost but actually more than more than half of our guests count declines explained in those 14. So we're putting more support and activity into those co-ops to see if we can just pull up that tail which says multi will lift us collectively as well and we're beginning to see traction there as well.","So there's a number of different ways we're approaching this, but we want to remain competitive on value clearly. Getting back to the drive-thru service times, we will see incremental visits as we continue to improve service. Fundamentally we are a quick service restaurant and all trends had been heading the wrong way for too many years. And I'm delighted at how much traction we're getting there given the focus you put on it this year.","And we know customers will notice 20 seconds, particularly the time press customers, those busy peak hours well, that's the breakfast rush or lunchtime. Those savings that they don't necessarily notice it on just one visit. But as we consistently run better restaurants, we believe that will be a strong competitive position going forward.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","DavidTarantino","Hi, good morning. And just a question on the technology investments you made in specifically dynamic yield. I guess what I was wondering if you could comment on what you're seeing so far as you roll it out and in terms of the customer response or the business impact? And how you see that evolving as I guess customers get more accustomed to using the technology?","SteveEasterbrook","At the moment we've effectively rolled out from core capability of dynamic users. Kind of what we would say suggest itself. The beauty of this is there is nothing that customer has to adjust to, they almost don't know that this experience is happening for them as we've got dynamic digital menu boards. And effectively as they start to place their order, the menu boards respond to that to that ordering process and therefore are more likely to suggest items a customer will want and less likely to show items that customers are less likely to want.","And of course, machine learning helps you improve that and particularly given the transaction levels we have across our business we can learn pretty really -- very quickly. But there's further capabilities as we're learning so for example, there's an area now where they can offer trending now which will actually pick up items either in a restaurant or a local group of restaurants that are proven to be particularly popular at that point in time. So there's kind of get another level of dynamic interaction going there.","And again, at this point, we're only really talking about having it on the outdoor digital menu boards. But suffice to say the team -- part of the investment we're making in the business with talent and expertise is to look how can we integrate that into the cell phone or kiosk and perhaps ultimately the global mobile app as well.","So I think we're at early stages already very encouraged about the results we're seeing. The speed with which we can execute and roll this out, deploy this is really giving us a lot of confidence that we can get this across. I guess we've now got an outdoor digital menu boards in over 10,000 restaurants in the US. And the majority of our full length international lead markets are pretty much fully deployed as well. UK has got a little bit of cash enough to do.","But as I say, this is encouraging operators to invest in the technology because they're seeing the return. And as I say, this is just for the core basic capability and there's more we can add to it.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","MattDiFrisco","Thank you. I just had a couple of follow up questions. I guess, can you just comment on how that 3% price should look, going forward, is something that is going to be held in?","And then I think in previous quarters, you described how much that was contributing to the check. And 2Q was about third of the check or so. If you could just sort of draw that line for us?","And then a clarification. I think you mentioned on the prepared remarks, hamburger share was gained or you gained hamburger share, but your traffic was negative. Does that imply then there was some near term increased competitive pressure around chicken and you lost a little bit of business and on the chicken side in the near term in the US?","SteveEasterbrook","Okay, I'll start. Price, Matt, let me start with how we think about it. I think we've talked before, but we look at various things. Certainly food-away-from-home is one guidepost. But also, we look at, and the pricing we talk about is pricing system wide which as you know 95% of those restaurants are run by franchisees determining that -- determining that pricing. But certainly I think if they consider their pricing, they're also looking at cost pressures, whether that's labor, commodities, et cetera. And it's really about trying to strategically balance, offsetting some of those cost pressures with kind of what a customer is willing to pay.","So, there isn't a pure formula, that 3% that -- and I think we said nearly 3%, actually it is a little bit below 3%, but close to 3%. And they impact at our comp is actually a little bit less than that, because while the pure price -- what I quoted are pure price increase, but you hit a little bit resistance. And so the actual contribution of the comp ends up being a little bit below that.","But it still is roughly that third, two-thirds, about a third, from price, roughly two-thirds from product mix for various reasons, including dynamic yield, the kiosk usage and delivery, all the things that we've been talking about.","So that's the -- that's the story on pricing. Related to the burger share, so as we said that in the U.S., we did gain hamburger share in the quarter. I think it's fair to assume with everything going on in the quarter with chicken that we did go a little bit the opposite way on chicken. So I think that's a fair conclusion.","So that, if we look at the top 11 markets, we actually gained IO share and QSR share in all 10 of the largest markets beyond the U.S. as well, including some extremely strong gains in markets like the UK, Russia, Australia, France as of all time market share high for example. So I think we are we have proven to be competitive and driving the broader market dynamic around the world actually, which is helping underpin the sales momentum and business momentum.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.","ChrisO'Cull","Yes, thanks. Steve, there's been a lot of discussion about how dynamic yield tech support suggestive selling. But I would think the new digital menu boards would also allow the company to do a better job of price optimization meaning, stores could be able to adjust prices more frequently. Can you describe how the new menu boards or digital boards will change kind of the company's approach to pricing?","SteveEasterbrook","Yes, we typically try to avoid that. And partly just because I think it's part of the brand promise we have the customers is just that reliability in knowing what their typical meal or combination costs. So it has been discussed sometimes through and I know others out there. And that's kind of, if you like ultimate dynamic pricing capability. But that's not really kind of underpinning the business the way we want to do business and to stay away from that.","We try and have a careful thoughtful approach with our kind of pricing consultants if you like. And we just make periodic adjustments and just give customers that that kind of assurance and reliability.","MikeCieplak","Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","BrianBittner","Thanks. Good morning. First, just a clarification on David Palmer's question on 2020. Kevin, should we be interpreting your answer in a way that we should be modeling 2020 as a below algorithm year for earnings or no?","And just on the store level margins in the U.S. a meaningful trend change in the margins there up 280 bps this quarter. Can you just dive a little deeper on what specifically changed in the margin dynamics this quarter for the U.S. versus last several quarters and should we expect it to continue? Thanks.","KevinOzan","Yes. Let me talk about the U.S. margins first. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned kind of what I called operational performance improvements. And really what that means, as I'm exciting as this may be is kind of the basics of running better restaurants. We keep talking about just running better restaurants and getting more efficient in running restaurants. But it's things like reducing complexity in the restaurant, simplifying procedures, focusing on efficiencies and the derive thru, being more diligent with our labor, scheduling and staffing, basic food control.","So it's all that stuff that we talk about when it's just managing a restaurant really well. And I think putting more of a focus on that has helped our company operated folks focus on that.","To be fair, I think the other piece, I would just throw in there a little bit. Is there is less disruption going on this year than there was last year from a couple standpoint -- couple pieces. One we're almost completed with EOTF in the company operated restaurants.","So by the end of this year we will have all of the EOTF projects in our company operated restaurant completed. That's one thing that does, is a distraction and disruptions to the restaurant. The other thing as you know is we have been re-franchising over the last several years and that becomes a little bit of a disruption certainly to the company operated business.","So the fact that that's more stable and we have kind of settled in where we are now, I think helps just the stability of running the restaurants on the company operated site. So all of those things I think go into play into why you certainly saw some of that improvement this year. I think as we look forward in the near term in the U.S., we still do have some pressures like the EOTF depreciation, some labor costs.","But I think kind of similar range that we've been in the 15% to 16%ish range in the US is probably a reasonable way to think about it going forward.","Regarding 2020 in the fourth quarter we will give more detail and go through our actual outlook that will provide more detailed guidance. I'll leave what I said for now as general guidance and it certainly we will get into more detail as we get to year end. We\u2019re in the midst of going through our detailed planning right as we speak. And so I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead before we actually complete that process.","Mike Cieplak","That completes our call this morning. Thanks everybody for joining us. Have a good day.","Operator","This does conclude the McDonald's Corporation Investor Conference Call."],"13712":["McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 20, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Kathy Martin - ","James A.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Ms. Martin, you may begin.","Kathy Martin","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me on the call are Chief Executive Officer Jim Skinner; Chief Operating Officer Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer Pete Bensen. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. ","And before I turn it over to Jim, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on our website, www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures. So now I'd like to turn it over to Jim. Jim?","James A. Skinner","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. As you know, I recently announced my retirement after 41 years with McDonald's and almost 8 years as CEO. The time was right for me to make this decision as our business continues to be very strong. ","For the quarter, comparable sales were up 7.3%; operating income increased 9% in constant currencies; and EPS reached $1.23, an 8% increase in constant currencies.","Our system is aligned and focused and we have an outstanding leader in Don to step in and continue our momentum. I'm extremely confident in Don and his leadership team, and I know the business is in very capable hands. I also know that our system of outstanding operators, suppliers and employees will continue working together to drive our results. And let me say it's been a pleasure working with all of you in the investment community over these years. I appreciate your continued engagement and your interest our business, as well as your thoughtfulness when you put together your viewpoints and your assessment of McDonald's. I wish you all well. And with that, I'll turn it over to Don to discuss the quarter's results around the world.","Donald Thompson","Thanks, Jim. And thank you for your tremendous leadership and all you've done for McDonald's. You're a terrific partner, a mentor, and you'll definitely be missed.","Well, good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share McDonald's latest quarterly results, which reflect the strength of our business. Our continued momentum remains a system-wide effort with positive trends continuing in every area of the world. ","In the U.S., comparable sales increased 8.9% for the quarter and operating income rose 10%. Europe's comparable sales were up 5% and operating income grew 8% in constant currencies. And in Asia\/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, or what we call APMEA, comp sales grew 5.5% and operating income was up 7% in constant currencies. Our momentum is continuing into April, with global comparable sales growth expected to be about 4%.","We are pleased with these results, particularly given the headwinds we've faced on both the top and bottom lines, and the fact that we'll continue to face these headwinds throughout the rest of the year. The economic climate remains challenging, with varying degrees of consumer confidence, economic pressures and inflationary costs. And our success in this volatile environment is a testament to our Plan to Win and our relentless focus on customers' needs. Around the world, we continue to gain market share in an industry with minimal to negative growth.","We also remain committed to our proven plan and to executing against our 3 global priorities, which are optimizing our menu, modernizing the customer experience and broadening accessibility to brand McDonald's.","In the U.S., our strong sales were the result of a focus on our core and new products, as well as value and convenience. The mild winter weather also benefited sales and traffic, but to a lesser extent. This momentum helped offset some of the headwinds and margin challenges we're facing due to pressures like commodities that we've mentioned before. ","We continued to meet our customers' desire for a great breakfast during the quarter by advertising our increasingly popular wholesome choices menu, which includes a great selection of items with no more than 300 calories each, like our oatmeal, the Egg McMuffin, and Fruit 'N Yogurt Parfait. We also featured our iconic Big Mac, which lifted sales of both Big Macs and Mac Snack Wraps.","In January, the U.S. launched Chicken McBites, a bite-sized chicken offering. McBites contributed to the growth of the overall chicken sales by providing a tasty solution that is shareable and a great snack. We often say that the power of our system lies in our ability to learn from each other, then share, then scale ideas, and McBites is a great example of that. The product originated in Australia, and its positioning as a promotional food event came out of Europe. This approach significantly reduces time-to-market compared with developing a product from scratch. You can expect to see us share even more menu ideas, given the strong global pipeline that we can tap into. ","The U.S. also continues to strengthen its position as a beverage destination, with total beverage units up 6% over last year. And in the weeks ahead, we'll be enhancing our McCaf\u00e9 blended ice lineup with a new Cherry Berry Chiller. It's a refreshing new drink made with 100% juice. Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to broaden accessibility by evolving its value proposition with the new Extra Value Menu. This menu builds on the iconic Dollar Menu by offering a great selection of products at various value price points, from Snack Wraps under $2 to 20-piece McNuggets at $4.99.","We're also focused on maximizing restaurant throughput and capacity. More than 1\/3 of all restaurants are leveraging a form of multiple order points, including tandem or side-by-side drive-thrus, along with nearly 1,200 handheld order takers.","Now let's turn to Europe, a region that continues to experience unprecedented economic challenges from widespread austerity measures, concerns over the sovereign debt crisis and unemployment levels averaging about 10%. Our business has held strong despite the impact of the environment and what it's having on consumers' purchasing power. We remain focused, however, on upgrading the overall experience and are continuously looking to provide even greater value across our menu. From entry-level to core and premium products, we have to provide value to ensure we remain relevant in this environment.","In the area of menu, Europe has led the way with limited-time offers that we call promotional food events. This quarter, France featured 2 premium beef sandwiches, the McFarmer and McTimber, which resonated with customers. In the U.K., strong promotions around the Big Tasty beef sandwich and our 20-piece McNuggets ShareBox exceeded our expectations, as did Germany's re-hit of the 1955 burger.","Considering the ongoing pressures on consumers and our focus on maintaining and growing guest counts, we've stepped up our emphasis on branded affordability. Germany's newly evolved value menu contributed to sales during the quarter, which helped offset increased competitive value offers. In the U.K., sales from the Saver Menu grew double-digits versus the prior year. And France is also evaluating options to further strengthen value perceptions at a time when a number of new austerity measures are impacting consumers' confidence and their disposable income.","Europe continues to lead the systems reimaging efforts. 80% of our interiors and 50% of our exteriors have been refreshed, elevating perceptions of the McDonald's brand and strengthening appeal with today's consumers. And we continue to broaden our accessibility through the rollout of the new point-of-sale system across Europe and the expansion of McCaf\u00e9s. Approximately 150 more will be added this year. As we said before, our holistic approach to the business and attention to evolving consumer needs serves us well in these times of austerity and economic uncertainty and for the long-term growth of the region.","Now over to APMEA, where we're also seeing challenging economic conditions with slow growth in China and ongoing tightening in Australia. We're managing through the environment with a focus on compelling menu offerings, strong value and convenience. Australia is focused on branded affordability, particularly the Value Lunch program, has been key to its solid gains in this quarter. In March, we launched the Loose Change menu. This menu features 7 items ranging from a soft-serve ice cream cone at AUD $0.30 to a Double Cheeseburger at AUD $2. And early results are encouraging. We also had some new food news in the market, with the introduction of our new Spicy Chicken McBites, smoothies and frapp\u00e9s. Australia is the first market in APMEA to launch these blended ice drinks, and as we've seen elsewhere, these products are a hit, selling above our expectations. ","Japan's results remain uneven, as the recovery from last year's devastating events continues and consumers are eating at home more often. Strong support of our core products, compelling limited-time offers and a focus on breakfast have contributed to hard-sought market share gains in a retracting industry. Our Big Mac promotion helped boost sales and lift average check, and a focus on our Premium Roast Coffee and popular menu items like the Sausage McMuffin and hotcakes during the morning hours have ensured that breakfast remains a strong contributor to Japan's results. We expect short-term volatility will continue but remain optimistic about Japan for the long term.","And while China's economy is still expected to grow at about 8% in 2012, this is a slowdown from last year's growth of just over 9%, with much of this attributed to a reduction in exports. McDonald's China delivered first quarter comparable sales of 8.5%. We remain committed to offering great value and local menu favorites to continue to drive our results. Our Value Lunch is a staple in the minds of Chinese consumers, and the addition of the chicken burger has helped keep the momentum going, driving lunchtime comp sales by double-digits. We will also be launching a value dinner program in the coming months. Value is also delivering results at breakfast, and helped grow comparable sales by over 20% for this important daypart. Beyond breakfast, we ran a series of successful menu promotions around Chinese New Year that provided a lift in overall sales and traffic.","APMEA remains a region of tremendous growth and opportunity. We remain excited about our future potential in this growing region as we build on our menu and value and extend the convenience of our brand through drive-thru, delivery, kiosks and extended hours, as well as new restaurant development.","All in all, we continue to strengthen our business and build on our success in a strategic and a comprehensive way. We're equally committed to maintaining a strong financial foundation and maximizing value for our system and for our shareholders. These are the hallmarks of how we have and will continue to manage our business. Our long-term average annual targets remain intact, with sales growth of 3% to 5%, operating income growth of 6% to 7% and return on incrementally invested capital in the high-teens. Our intent remains to return all of our cash flow, after reinvesting in the business, to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In fact, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this quarter.","Overall, I'm pleased with our latest quarterly results. However, I also know there's much more work to be done. With a fragile global economy and numerous pressures to contend with, we're staying focused on those things within our control. We remain committed to executing our Plan to Win and delivering an exceptional experience for our nearly 68 million customers per day. Next week, we will be with Owner\/Operators from around the world at our biennial convention. This meeting provides a great opportunity to share ideas and also solidify plans for today and for the future. The fundamentals of our business are strong, our system is aligned, and I am confident that together we will deliver continued growth. Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to Pete.","Peter J. Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. We start 2012 where we left off in 2011, with strong sales momentum and market share growth around the world. We are guided by the Plan to Win and our 3 global priorities: optimizing the menu, modernizing the experience and broadening accessibility. We continue to approach our business holistically and see many opportunities ahead, even as we manage through a volatile and inflationary environment. Our strong performance and balance sheet enables investments in key system initiatives to help sustain our momentum over the long term. As we outlined at our investor meeting last November, we are willing and able to invest for continued growth and to widen our competitive advantages, recognizing that in the short term, these investments along with other near-term headwinds will impact our 2012 operating income growth. We believe our strategies and focused execution are right for the business and will create significant shareholder value over the coming years.","We are pleased with the first quarter results, which were led by a 10% constant currency increase in system-wide sales amidst a challenging economic landscape. Combined operating margin rose 10 basis points to 30% due to strong comparable sales, mostly offset by higher costs. The largest component of operating income is our franchise margin, representing nearly 70% of total restaurant margin dollars. Franchise margin dollars rose $135 million to over $1.7 billion, a 10% constant currency increase, with every area of the world contributing. Consolidated franchise margin percent rose 40 basis points to 82.3%, as positive comparable sales more than offset higher costs. Please note there was a change in classification of certain franchising costs in Australia beginning in first quarter. This negatively affected APMEA's franchise margin percent by about 40 basis points but had no impact on overall margin dollars. This change in classification will have a similar impact on APMEA's franchise margin percent for the balance of the year.","Global company operated margin dollars grew $42 million to $778 million for the quarter, while the percent decreased 20 basis points to 17.5%. Rising commodity, labor and occupancy costs, particularly in the U.S., offset strong comparable sales. In the U.S., company operated margins declined 70 basis points to 18.8%, primarily due to higher commodity costs.","First quarter commodity costs in the U.S. rose 7%, primarily driven by increases in beef. We expect to experience similar pressure in the second quarter, and then easing a bit in the second half of the year. The full year outlook for the increase in our U.S. grocery basket remains at 4.5% to 5.5%. The cost increases were partly offset by strong guest count growth and a nearly 1% price increase in February. Combined with last year's price increases, the U.S. business is running about a 3% price increase versus a year ago. While we typically keep price increases similar to or slightly below food-away-from-home inflation index, we also keep a close eye on food-at-home inflation, which has been rising faster than food-away-from-home. We remain mindful of balancing future price increases with our desire to maintain growth in guest counts and market share.","In addition, in first quarter, we invested in local value promotions to drive sales. We also invested in labor to build capacity, primarily during peak hours. This contributed to a significant improvement in guest count growth for the quarter during the critical noon to 1 p.m. hour. Providing compelling value throughout our menu and increasing peak hour capacity are critical components to our long-term growth. In first quarter, these initiatives impacted our ability to realize greater margin leverage despite strong comp sales. All of these headwinds are expected to continue as we anticipate similar U.S. company operated margin percent declines at least through the second quarter.","Turning to Europe. Company operated margins increased 30 basis points to 17.5%, as solid comparable sales more than offset higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. Very strong comparable sales increases in Russia and the U.K., our 2 largest McOpCo markets in Europe, drove the margin expansion.","Europe's grocery bill was up about 5% in the quarter. We expect a little less of an increase in second quarter, with the full year increase still projected at 2.5% to 3.5%. Though Europe is facing less overall commodity inflation compared to the U.S., the impact of austerity measures is weighing on both our top and bottom lines. Across Europe, the average price increase for the trailing 12 months, excluding Russia, is about 2% to 3%. We do not currently have as much pricing power in Europe and in key markets, such as France and Germany, where we are evolving our value offerings and messaging to address growing consumer needs. The combination of all these factors is expected to pressure company operated margins over the next few quarters.","In Asia\/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company operated margins declined 60 basis points to 16.9%, as strong comparable sales were offset by higher commodity, labor and occupancy costs. In addition, the new restaurant openings in China contributed to the lower margin percent. While China's new restaurants pressure margins early on, within a few years of opening, most restaurants generate operating margins that approach the market's average.","G&A for the quarter increased 6% in constant currencies. We expect the next 2 quarters will experience more significant increases due to our Worldwide Convention in April, the Summer Olympics starting in late July and the ongoing technology enhancements.","With the favorable interest rate environment and our strong credit rating, we are taking advantage of our ability to issue debt at low rates, but we are not changing our philosophy toward our balance sheet. The change in our interest expense outlook is being driven by stronger foreign currencies versus 3 months ago, not an increase in anticipated borrowings for the year.","The first quarter effective tax rate of 31.4% represented a significant increase versus the prior year rate of 28.8%, which was aided by a nonrecurring deferred tax benefit related to our foreign operations. We continue to project the full year rate to be between 31% and 33%.","We are confident that the investments being made today will build customer loyalty, drive returns and enhance shareholder value over the long term. We're operating from a position of strength and seizing the opportunity to modernize our brand while leveraging our size and scale in a way that others simply cannot match. Our franchisees remained aligned with our strategies and have the capacity and willingness to invest. For example, the average traditional restaurant in the U.S. now generates over $2.5 million in annual sales and $340,000 in pre-debt cash flow. Just 5 years ago, our average volume and cash flow per restaurant were about $2.1 million and $290,000, respectively. ","The strong financial foundation of our operators around the world allows them to invest in key strategic initiatives like reimaging. We are on track to reimage at least 2,400 restaurants this year, including 800 in the U.S., 900 in Europe and 475 in APMEA. Through first quarter, we've completed about 350 reimages globally. In addition, we will complete over 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year. And opening new units also remains a focus because we see significant opportunity to strategically extend our brand. In 2012, we expect to open more than 1,300 new restaurants, including 450 in Latin America, Japan and other markets, where we invest no capital. ","Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current rates, we expect second and third quarter EPS to each be negatively impacted by $0.05 to $0.07, with the full year negative impact ranging from $0.12 to $0.14. As usual, this is directional guidance only because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year.","We remain committed to making the right long-term decisions for the system and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong, and we are pleased with first quarter results, given the environment. We remain focused on widening our competitive advantages over the coming years. Even with the headwinds in 2012, I'm confident that we can meet our financial targets this year and continue to build significant shareholder value. Thank you. Now I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.","Kathy Martin","Thanks, Pete. We're ready to open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] So we are ready to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Kathy Martin","And we'll start with David Palmer from UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just in case Jim Skinner is not going to be on the second quarter call, just wanted to say thank you and congratulations for a great career. Taco Bell, Burger King, those are a couple of big competitors in the U.S. that are making a big sales go-at-it here heading into the second quarter. I don't normally think about the smaller competitors having a much of an impact on McDonald's, but do you think that, that could be something of a competitive encroachment in the second quarter that we should be thinking about? And secondly, just out of Europe, can you give us a sense of the type of marketing changes you may be already making in places like France and Germany, that more value-oriented marketing that you discussed?","James A. Skinner","David, thanks for your comments. And the question regarding the United States, I'll take, and Don can add some texture if he likes and he can talk about the marketing in Europe, which we are managing effectively, as Pete mentioned in his comments and Don also mentioned. But United States, of course, Burger King and Taco Bell and all of our other competitors, we keep a close eye on in terms of what their activities are like. But it's not our first rodeo regarding this. And they have spurts of enthusiasm and excitement for their brand typically when there's a change in ownership. And so they are doing some things that are meaningful for their brand, they believe. And yet we think that it's business-as-usual for McDonald's relative to what we're focused on, and our strategies have served us very, very well. When you look at optimizing the menu, improving customer relevance as we've done, and accessibility and to our Plan to Win, we expect to be able to maintain our competitive differentiation there, regarding those competitors. And Don, you want to talk a little bit about the marketing in Europe?","Donald Thompson","Yes. Relative to Europe, David, we have had -- we have ongoing conversations with all the markets, not just those in Europe, but relative to what's happening in a broader business environment and how we are faring. One of the things that we've seen thus far is we continue to gain market share across Europe. And so we know that despite some of the IEO growth or lack thereof, we continue to appeal to consumers and customers across-the-board. Now what we've done, particularly in France and Germany, is we have had some, as you would imagine, more aggressive conversations around how we position our value menus and value offerings. In Germany, they've done some things with their basic value menu, which we call SMS. They made some changes there, as well as they, the franchisees, are considering other things that they might want to do to continue the momentum that we've had relative to market share gains. However, I will say consumer confidence is still one of the things we monitor across Europe, inclusive of Germany and France. In France, we have a great opportunity to better leverage our P'tits Plaisirs platform. So you can probably imagine that we will continue to do that, as well as look for other opportunities to continue to move forward the menu and provide good price value. So those are some of the things we're doing there. Just one touch point, and Jim mentioned several things and he's kept us very focused, as you all can imagine, on consistency in terms of how we run the business. So when you mentioned some of the competitors in the U.S. also, we continue to watch our gain there as well. In the U.S., we're up 60 basis points in terms of market share, which is really, really strong growth. And Jan Fields and her team are doing a great job there, as well we continue to have a positive sales comp gap. And so those things are things we also measure to ensure that we're doing the right thing for our customers.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from David Tarantino from R.W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Jim, congratulations on your retirement and, Don, congratulations on your new role. My question really is a follow-up related to the Europe business. You saw a nice recovery in the comp trend in March. And I just wanted to understand the underlying dynamics there in the various markets, and if you think that maybe February was more of an anomaly related to weather and that the underlying trend is actually more consistent with what you saw in January and March. And then I guess, secondly, have you already implemented some of these initiatives that you've talked about that may be helping the trend in March? Or are those something that you're planning going forward in anticipation of a tough economy?","Donald Thompson","David, thanks much. And thanks for the recognition, both of Jim and myself. I'll tell you a couple of different things. One is we have already begun some of the planning. Some of these things were implemented before, and we just have to change some of our marketing emphasis, i.e. in Germany, relative to the value platform. France already had P'tits Plaisirs. However, it does end up being a marketing GRP visibility and awareness play more so than anything else, because we've got the tools and the arsenal already, which is good. We can just lever them up. Now here's the other thing I would say relative to Europe, and you asked about do we think it will continue. Europe, the first quarter had a lot of different pieces in it. Clearly, we had the 200-year weather cycle, which was a negative impact. We have the positive impact of things like bank holidays. We have a lot of moving parts. However, we know that the underlying thing that we have to do is have good price value across-the-board while consumers are facing some confidence issues due to austerity measures, and then some of the other things such as pension issues in the U.K. and taxes and VAT increases across-the-board. So we do have many plans already in place. There are some new things we will put in place, but the biggest part is just how we shift our marketing to enhance the value messaging and awareness.","Kathy Martin","Next question is from Jason West, Deutsche Bank.","Jason West - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to ask on China. You alluded to some modest slowdown there. If you could talk a bit about, is that more regional? I believe during the last recession, you saw more impact in the export-driven markets, if you're seeing sort of a regional impact this time as well. And sort of if you could talk daypart-wise and if there's been any impact from some of the PR issues there recently.","Peter J. Bensen","Jason, it's Pete. The China business has continued to perform pretty well for us. You know that March was a little slower than the 2-month trend had been, January and February. But there's no specific region or particular issue to point to. One of the things -- we had a big beef promotion this March relative to a big chicken promotion last March so that had a little bit of a negative impact. We did see a little regionalized slowdown after some of the negative publicity you alluded to, but that wasn't terribly significant. So we remain on track there and are comfortable with where we're going.","Kathy Martin","The next question is Andy Barish from Jefferies.","Andrew M. Barish - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, just finishing up maybe the European discussion on the -- your thoughts just as it pertains to the margin impact with a little bit more focus on promotion or value going forward. Europe delivered good margins here in the first quarter with Russia and the U.K., as you mentioned. But any subtle shifts kind of as you focus a little bit more on value going forward?","James A. Skinner","I think margins, as you know, Andy, are a top line game, and this is all about generating more traffic through the leveraging of our everyday affordability, which Don had mentioned in terms of getting ourselves in the appropriate position and putting the muscle behind it in marketing, particularly in Germany and France. And we think that, that will be beneficial as the traffic increases and the top line grows into the future. And so we don't really look at that as having a significant impact on margins relative to anything we do on everyday affordability.","Peter J. Bensen","Yes. Andy, as you pointed out, it really is kind of a tale of 2 Europes, if you will, with Russia having some high-teen comps and the U.K. around 10%. They really drove some pretty good margin performance here in the first quarter. As we head to second quarter, we obviously, we won't have the leap day benefit. Generally, in the markets that Jim talked about, while we'll enhance our messaging around the local value or the everyday affordability, that tendency is initially you'll see a little dip in the average check. But as the transactions grow, you get that back over time. And in those markets with that environment, we also probably have a little less pricing power as last year's increases roll off and we'll probably be able to take a little bit less this year. Net-net, those are the pressures I alluded to when I mentioned that in my comments.","Kathy Martin","Next question is Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.","Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a two-part question. First, just as it relates to -- Pete, you mentioned the food-at-home versus food-away-from-home discussion. And I know the gap has been fairly wide, which gave you guys some comfort or confidence on perhaps being more aggressive on price. But it seems like recently the gap has narrowed. And as commodity inflation is going to ease as we move through the year, I'm just wondering, one, how you think about further price increases beyond the 3% in the U.S. today. And then just as a separate add-on to Pete's comments earlier, I know you said -- when you think about 2012, that you're investing for continued growth and how that's going to pressure the operating income, and you also kind of talked about being somewhat cautious on U.S. and European margins the next couple of quarters. So I was just hoping you could frame up the directional thought for 2012. I think you still sounded fairly confident that you can hit your 6% to 7% operating income. I guess, that's kind of your long-term. So I'm just wondering if you can give some directional color with all those pressures you alluded to and confidence still hitting that target.","Peter J. Bensen","Sure. First, on the pricing in the U.S., Jeff. You kind of -- you hit on the head, as over the last several months, there's been a wider gap on the food-at-home being growing greater than the food-away-from-home. That gap is starting to narrow. And in fact, the outlook, food-away-from-home is still projected to grow at 2% to 3% this year. But food-away-from-home is now projected to grow 2.5% to 3.5%. That's down a little bit from the last projection. So that gap is narrowing. And as you think traditionally about our parameters, that 2% to 3% for food-away-from-home, absent any significant gap with the food-at-home, is probably a good way to think about our pricing for the year. So that 2% to 3% is probably the constraints for that one.","Donald Thompson","Jeff, the other part of this one, too, is we -- and Pete mentioned this. We really look at food-away-from-home as our primary metric relative to how we establish our strategic pricing. We look at food-at-home, it's kind of -- because we can't price the food-at-home because it's too much more -- it's too volatile. It swings up and down so much more aggressively. So we look at food-away-from-home primarily. But what food-at-home tells us is whether or not we may be seeing additional pressures relative to, say, a breakfast daypart. And so that allows us to adjust some of our marketing and our value messaging appropriately.","Peter J. Bensen","Regarding the conversation on the longer-term targets, Jeff, very comfortable in the 6% to -- our long-term target, 6% to 7%, obviously the last few years, we've been significantly ahead of that. But as we outlined in November, with some of the actions we're taking to invest and some of these near-term headwinds around commodities, we're probably closer to that 6% to 7% this year than we've been the last few years, and specifically, these next couple of quarters. So in the U.S., I mentioned commodities will be up another close to 7% again in the second quarter, and we won't have the benefit of leap year and the favorable weather. So again, margins look pretty similar in the second quarter for the U.S. I mentioned the G&A. We haven't come off our 6% forecast for the year. But with the timing of some of these events, our internal plans are at double-digit G&A growth for the next couple of quarters. So as we look throughout the year, again, we're very confident in our ability to hit that long-term target. But there's going to be -- the next couple of quarters may look a little down off of that relative to some of these items that I mentioned.","Kathy Martin","And our next question is from John Glass, Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to maybe just go back to the U.S. and talk about the new Extra Value Menu and what your intentions are here. I know you've made some changes to the Dollar Menu as well. So is the intention here to maybe migrate people off the Dollar Menu as a basis for just the meal and try to get more traction with sort of a value but at a higher price point? Maybe you can talk about if this menu has any implications from a margin standpoint. And then, Pete, just I wanted to clarify your comments about the operating income growth, 6% to 7%. That's constant currencies, correct? So as we look at next couple of quarters, with currency pressure magnifying, it's probably on a reported basis probably even less than that.","Peter J. Bensen","Correct, John. I'll clarify the operating income comments, and then Don can talk about the Extra Value Menu. But you're right. That long-term guidance is in constant currency. And with the $0.05 to $0.07 each of the next couple quarters of pressure, obviously the reported number will be less than that.","Donald Thompson","And, John, relative to the new Extra Value Menu, it fits within an overall price value strategy that we continue to move forward. As we look at commodity pressures clearly, we understand that there are certain aspects of the Dollar Menu that are tougher relative to cash flow and margin accretion. So what we've looked to do with the new Extra Value Menu is to have some opportunity to bring some products down to a lower level price, i.e. the 20-piece McNugget, which are really compelling and shareable offer to customers. But at the same time, we also know that this will highlight and emphasize products like the Snack Wraps, which are accretive to building the margin. So it's a combination of both longer-term, we know that we want to keep the Dollar Menu intact. However, you may see some changes within the menu and some of those products may change just a little bit. We'll rotate some new ones in possibly and some may rotate out. But we're going to make sure we continue to have great value for customers across-the-board, but you may see some changes in terms of the overall value menu strategies.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.","Matthew J. DiFrisco - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Congratulations again, Jim, on a great tenure. Just transitioning, I guess, to go a little bit further into Europe there. I guess, 2 of the countries -- you talked about France actually in this sales -- in this monthly sales release as being one of the stronger regions. And then also looking at France and Portugal, sort of those 2 countries that have seen the VAT increase, I guess, for restaurants as it's been reported this year, would you -- could you give us some color on as far as, what have you seen in trends early on in the year? Has the consumer reverted a little bit home with their food dollar? Or are you sort of having somewhat of a countercyclical benefit? And are people, for lack of a better term, I guess, trading down to better value and coming into your restaurant, that maybe in the past wouldn't have, given the, I guess, it's about a 150 bps jump on the VAT in France?","Donald Thompson","Matt, I would say, first of all, relative to France, I wouldn't say that France is one of the stronger performing areas today. I think they're going through some serious consumer confidence issues, and we're also seeing a lessened discretionary spending. There's some concerns in the marketplace relative to austerity measures. Having said that, we continue to perform and continue to grow market share. And that's the point. And when the IEO is contracting or slowing down, our focus becomes how we can continue to grow market share and maintain a larger base of customers. And so we're going to continue to do that in France. Portugal is a very interesting area relative to the 10% VAT increase they had there, going from 13 to 23 percentile. We have done a lot of work with our franchisees there to make sure that we maintain a great price value component in the overall strategy. Now what that means in the short term is that in a small market like Portugal, we may have some decreased margins. But in the longer-term, we'll secure the customer base and we'll build the business as we move forward, so -- but things like that are happening, whether it be Portugal. It's happened in Hungary, Romania before. But these are smaller markets.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Mitch Speiser from Buckingham. Okay. We're going to move on then. Joe Buckley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I want to echo all the positive comments and wish you good luck. Question on the noon to 1 p.m. throughput comments and putting more labor into the stores. Can you talk about if it's simply that or if there are other measures improving that throughput? And probably the same question, talk about some of the technology investments that you referred to. Is some of that directed at labor productivity and throughput?","Peter J. Bensen","Yes, it absolutely is, Joe. So there's a couple of things that are impacting that. One is a focus on what we call scheduling, staffing and positioning. So how many people do we have on the floor during those peak hours and where are they positioned is very important to driving more transactions through the restaurant during those peak hours. So do we have all of our kitchen equipment fully utilized? So both sides of our sandwich preparation table, for example. But also, the new register system, the new point-of-sale system, as you point out, is also an enabler because we're able to take orders more quickly and more accurately, so we get the customer through the restaurant. But that new POS also enables things like the handheld order taker and the side-by-side drive-thru, which again gets more orders back into that kitchen during these peak hours, which is another way to expand our capacity. But those -- the new POS had already been in the U.S. last year, and so there was no incremental cost relative to that in this quarter. But certainly, with adding some additional labor under the staffing guidelines, that's where we start to see a little impact on the labor line. Net-net, to grow, I think we grew comp transactions 5% during that lunch hour in the first quarter. And that was a significantly greater growth relative to that hour in the prior year. So those investments are definitely paying off for us.","Kathy Martin","All right. Our next question is from Sara Senatore, Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So I did want to ask about Europe, and 2 follow-ups, if I may. One is Europe. And that is, can you kind of parallel what you see in Europe now that maybe what you saw in the U.S. in 2009? Because I feel like, in many ways, we talked about the same -- not a lot of tolerance for rising prices and sort of it took a little while, but eventually, the cumulative effects of what we saw in the U.S. in '08 kind of hit home in '09. So is that sort of what we should anticipate for the year ahead in France and Germany, may play out like we saw in the U.S. in '09? And then on China, can you just talk briefly, you had -- breakfast grew 20% overall comps rate in the half. Can you just tell us how much price you had on there and whether you saw relative softness in either of the other dayparts?","Donald Thompson","Sarah, this is Don. A couple of things. I think a very astute comment relative to Europe or France today versus the U.S. a couple of years ago. And actually, I'd even go back to the 2008 time frame, 2008, 2009. They are quite similar in that what we did then was we put much more emphasis on our value messaging from a marketing perspective. We made the value offerings more prominent in the restaurant, and that definitely helped us secure what I will call those customers who had decreased discretionary dollars, and they continued to come into McDonald's. And in Europe, across-the-board, we're doing the same thing now. We've been doing it with the Eurosaver Menu in markets like the U.K. We're doing it with SMS in Germany. We're doing it with P'tits Plaisirs in France. I do believe that what we're facing in France now, because we've had -- we haven't had the same strong competitive set in France, we've not had to go there as aggressively, but now we're at a point where from a consumer confident perspective, we are going there a lot stronger relative to that marketing power. So I think it's a very, very good comment. They are somewhat similar. The difference, though, I would say in Europe, Europe, we have a foundation, particularly in markets like France, of having the restaurants reimaged. And so that definitely helps us and allows us also to continue to sell some more premium-based products. Relative to China, in terms of pricing, that's something that normally we don't disclose, but I think this -- in this case is important. China, we did a price increase of 5 percentile. And we know that, that is going to help us relative to moving forward to be able to help us with margin and also help us face some of the commodity-based pressures that we see there.","Peter J. Bensen","But with the -- your specific question, Sara, about the breakfast. Breakfast is less than 20 -- is less than 10% of the business there. So while the comps were really strong, and obviously were strong at lunch, where we saw a little lesser momentum was in our dessert kiosks and a little bit more of the discretionary visit potentially, so the snacking kind of visit. But again, the balance of where the business is coming from in China is still pretty good. And it's coming from where we're really focusing a lot of our attention, so that's good. And just to clarify that 5% number that Don gave, that's our trailing 12-month impact of the price increases. We didn't take all of that in this first quarter.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe just a follow up on the U.S. I mean, you've talked about pricing. But I mean, what do you think about, I guess, a couple of things? Kind of excluding the benefit from remodels or reimages, if it's possible to do that, what kind of an industry traffic growth environment do you think we are in the U.S., in other words, as you kind of slowly improving employment and, I guess, consumer confidence offsetting higher gas prices to where we kind of are in a tailwind environment as opposed to a headwind environment? And secondly, when we think about the overall menu, obviously some changes to value and how you're positioning things and the potential introduction of premium-priced, limited-time-only products, are we kind of in your positive mix environment, perhaps at least in '12 or, I mean, perhaps even in the next couple of years? So just trying to get you to kind of think about price mix and traffic in the U.S. and what kind of environment that we have, helping you or hurting you.","James A. Skinner","Yes, John. Jim Skinner. Just make a couple of comments on that. First of all, the employment environment, based on yesterday's number, is actually getting a little worse instead of getting a little bit better in terms of jobless claims. And it's been fairly flat. We're at that 8% unemployment or better -- or worse, I should say, 8.3%, whatever that number is. And the consumer confidence has gone up some, but I think that's just because people are sort of worn-out over the overall economic issues and how it's impacting them personally. And so they're just in a place of normalcy now relative to this entire issue on the economy and savings and eating at home and eating away from home. And that environment, as you know, has continued to operate about the same as it has been. And so our philosophy around pricing and menu and Dollar Menu and all of those things that Don talked about earlier has remained the same. We really haven't changed our strategy around that. We always have to have everyday affordability, the best in the business, at McDonald's. That's been our mantra really since 2002 and the advent of the Dollar Menu. And then obviously, the introduction of new menu items and snack items and what we call that fourth-tier area. So there's really not been a change regarding that. And the traffic has continued to be fairly robust in the U.S. around that for our restaurants. And we continued, as you know, to take share in the U.S. against the competitive set.","Peter J. Bensen","The update we got just yesterday, John, from our folks in the U.S. actually shows the -- actually a slight drop in the forecast for the year for the traffic for the industry. It's projected to grow less than 1%. And so that makes our traffic growth even that much more remarkable in that environment. As it's starting to level off or decline a little bit, we continue to see significant traffic gains in the U.S.","Kathy Martin","Our next question is from Keith Siegner from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Keith Siegner - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question for either Pete or Don, just kind of an update on the reimaging program. I mean, we've had some -- I ask because you've got a couple large competitors announce big programs. It's been at least a year now since we had a real good update down in Tampa. And we know you're never complacent. So have you made any changes to the prototype? Is the cost of the remodel looking any different? Are the sales lifts looking any different? Just some general updates on that program, because clearly it's very impactful and an important part of the outlook, would be great.","Donald Thompson","Keith, first of all, the reimaging efforts are going quite well. And I'll speak specifically about the U.S. I think your question was more focused on the U.S. We have upgraded the course. And I think that, that was something that we did early -- about the middle of the year last year. And we've got tremendous acceleration. In the latter part of the year, we reimaged quite a few, the predominance of our restaurants. We're on track this year to continue to exceed the numbers that we have out there right now. We think we're in that range of around 800 in terms of reimages in the U.S. And we feel very comfortable and confident in that number. What I've seen is that the sales, and the group reported to Pete and I and Jim earlier this week, the sales continue to be in the range, toward the high end of the range relative to what we told you guys about in that 6 percentile range relative to reimages. And the system itself is quite excited about it. I think we're going to continue to see aggressiveness in the reimages, relative to the competitive set. We hear a lot of information from time to time about others that are reimaging. I think the point for us is we have a proven track record of what reimaging can do, how to do it, how to maximize the opportunity and the sales from it, and also how to make sure that we get the cost in the right line. And so we're going to continue to do that, not only in the U.S., but as we complete the interiors in Europe and move further along with the exteriors and also as we move across APMEA and Latin America.","Peter J. Bensen","And one encouraging thing to add onto that, Keith, is now that we've got a history of stores that have more than 12 months of operation since reimaging, we're actually seeing higher sales increases as they cross that anniversary. And so they're actually closer to that 7% in our 6% to 7% range in their 13th, 14th, 15th month, which is again very encouraging and supportive of our belief that this is a great long-term investment.","Kathy Martin","Okay. Our next question is from Steve Marrs, CitizensTrust.","Steve Marrs - Citizens Business Bank","In your press release, you talked about APMEA growing first quarter sales by an increase of 5.5%. Also in your remarks, you talked about Japan being soft. Now here is my question. If you x out Japan, what would have APMEA been for the quarter, please?","Peter J. Bensen","Steve, we don't have that number at our fingertips. So maybe offline, the Investor Relations folks could give you that. But obviously, we talked about China. We talked about Australia. A lot of the other markets across APMEA are performing extremely well on the top line.","Donald Thompson","And at over 3,000 restaurants, the number would be much higher. But with us, again, that's not one that we kind of pull out when we factor sales.","Kathy Martin","Okay. We have time for one last question, Howard Penney from Hedgeye.","Howard W. Penney - Hedgeye Risk Management LLC","And I guess it's appropriate to ask Don about, the legacy of Jim Skinner has obviously been well-documented. He took over McDonald's after a difficult year. It was his job to keep the Plan to Win moving along and take McDonald's to the next level with beverages. And I understand you played a big part in that as well. As we look out over the next couple of years, what do you think your legacy will be when we're talking about your retirement? I know that's a little early, but if we could talk about your legacy and where you're seeing McDonald's is and maybe how do you think you'll take McDonald's to the next level, especially when we talk about the competition maybe reorganizing a little bit.","Donald Thompson","Howard, first of all, I hope that retirement point is quite a few years down the road. Otherwise, that might mean it was induced by something other than me. Here's a point, I think. Jim has always been very strong in telling all of us and continuing to drive the point of what we have to do is focus on the basics. I've been around McDonald's for over 20 years now, and I think what's most important for everyone is to understand that a change in leadership doesn't mean a change in strategy. I was here on the front end when we did the Plan to Win, and I understand what it means to our organization in terms of alignment. We remain focused on those things we've talked about: people, product, place, price, promotion. One of the things that we've done over the last couple of years, and Jim has been great about allowing myself and Pete and the rest of the team to really kind of take the mantle and lead some of the strategies that we have set forth. When we talk about modernizing the customer experience, technology will play a major role in that. But even more so will be the new look of McDonald's and what that allows us to do with our menu set. When we talk about optimizing the menu, we will be more focused, as we have been, on nutritional-based products, but also on focusing on our core and some premium products that we see coming out of areas like Europe. One of the things that we have that's a big potential, we can scale products and learn from the various areas of the world, and we will do that at a more accelerated pace. Lastly, I would say that when we talk about the broadening accessibility, we are much smarter now. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. We can deliver organic growth and we can build new restaurants. We know we can. We're doing it across APMEA and across many of our major markets. So we'll continue to do that. I don't worry about the legacy that will be left, and I'm not trying to chase the tremendous things that Jim has led us to do. I think myself and this team are focused on continuing to drive sustainable growth at McDonald's. And that is the key, Howard. And I think if we can continue to focus on the basics of this business; execution in the restaurants every day; the moment of truth, as Jim has called it, at that front counter; focused on the fact that we do have the power and the financial strength to grow both in development and organically, those are the things that I want to make sure we do. So I'm not really focused on the legacy aspect as much as I am continuing to see all of us move the business and grow as a global company.","Kathy Martin","Okay. We are done with our Q&A. And so I'm going to turn it over to Don for a few closing comments.","Donald Thompson","Thanks to all of you. And I want to thank everyone for joining us this morning. In closing, I just want to reiterate our confidence in the continued strength of our business around the world. We're delivering solid results because the entire McDonald's system remains aligned behind executing our Plan to Win, and we're focused on driving toward our mission to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Chris Stent, Senior Director of Investor Relations from McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Don Thompson; and Chief Financial Officer, Pete Bensen. In addition, Chief Operating Officer, Tim Fenton will join us for Q&A. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via phone, webcast and podcast. Before I turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that, as always, the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Don.","Don Thompson","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Despite mixed first quarter performance, McDonald's remains a daily destination for our 69 million customers around the world. The talented teams leading our business in 119 markets around the world continue to leverage their deep experience in a variety of operating environment.","Our strong system alignment has enabled us to remain focused on serving great tasting food and beverages in contemporary restaurants and at an affordable price because that's what matters most to our customers. These strengths combined with our diverse portfolio in terms of geography, menu and across day parts, enable us to build for the future while we remain focused on delivering in the short-term.","The challenging economic environment in which we're operating impacted our first quarter results. While there are mixed signs of a slow recovery in the U.S., significant headwinds persist as consumer confidence continues to waver. Persistently high unemployment rates and ongoing austerity measures in Europe and soft macroeconomic conditions in APMEA are pressuring consumer purchasing power as well.","And the informal eating out industry is either flat or declining in many markets around the world. Year-to-date March, our global comparable sales were down 1%. This reflects comparisons against strong prior year results that include an additional day due to leap year and last year\u2019s favorable weather. Operating income was flat in constant currencies and EPS was $1.26, a 3% increase in constant currencies. While not unexpected, we are not satisfied with our first quarter results.","Even though our top line comparables will ease through the remainder of the year, macroeconomic pressures will continue, and we\u2019ve also seen new challenges emerge in the marketplace like softer retail sales in the U.S. and the avian influenza outbreak in Asia.","So as we begin the second quarter, April global comparable sales are expected to be slightly negative. However, I am confident that we have the right plans in place to strengthen our business momentum for the long-term. We know we can\u2019t control the external environment in which we\u2019re operating, but we can leverage our scale and strength to aggressively pursue opportunities within our three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience, and broaden accessibility to brand McDonald\u2019s around the world.","As I share an update on our performance by geography, I\u2019ll provide examples that illustrate how local markets are executing their plans within the framework of our plan to win and these three global growth priorities. You\u2019ll also see in some cases that we continue to make adjustments to generate the greatest impact in the current environment and drive long-term growth.","Let\u2019s start with the U.S. where comparable sales for the quarter were down 1.2%, amidst the challenging eating out environment and operating income declined 3%. While our comparable sales were negative, we outperformed the competitive set and increased market share. This reflects our ability to continue differentiating our brand despite declines in IEO category. We continue to compliment Dollar Menu value news with a focus on core favorites and innovative new products. In addition to our annual focus on Filet-O-Fish during the Lenten season, we expanded the McBites platform to include Fish McBites.","Throughout the year, we will feature even more compelling new products in the United States especially in our four key growth categories of chicken, premium beef, breakfast and beverages. For example, Premium McWraps, a great innovation from Europe that we\u2019ve begun to scale globally; Egg White Delight, a tasty lower calorie addition to our breakfast line-up and Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothies which originated in Canada are three delicious new additions that position us to continue growing sales and market share in the second quarter.","In Europe, comparable sales were down 1.1% for the quarter and operating income was up 1% in constant currencies. Results in Germany and France remain soft, while the UK and Russia continue to deliver. Across the region, we\u2019re focused on building market share by reinforcing our value platform to offer compelling affordable products across all day parts and multiple price tiers. We build on that foundation by featuring premium products and promotions that encourage trade up and higher average check.","France launched Casse-Croute sandwich and drink combo for \u20ac4.50. It drove strong performance during the lunch day part by enabling us to compete with local bakeries through an appealing offer below the \u20ac5.00 price point.","In Germany, the \u20ac1.00 beef or chicken western burgers complemented (inaudible) and Stars of America promotional food events to contribute to results. Germany continues to refine its value offers across day parts in an effort to strengthen value perceptions for consumers who remain price sensitive in this challenging economic environment.","And in the UK, successful food events featuring premium products continued to resonate with our customers in this largely reimage marketplace. This past quarter promotions included the limited addition, Deli Choices, featuring the Cajun Crispy Chicken Sandwich. We also launched Chicken McBites in January as part of the UK tasters\u2019 menu. This limited time offer further validates the global appeal of this great product outside of Australia and the United States.","Russia also continues to deliver solid results with its focus on breakfast and seasonal menu offerings that emphasize local taste, including spicy wraps and spicy rolls. While both the UK and Russia posted positive comparable sales for the first quarter and continued to grow market share, momentum in both markets has slowed relative to strong results in 2012. This is the effect of weaken consumer confidence in the UK and lower levels of inflation in Russia that limit our pricing power.","Now, let\u2019s shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, where comparable sales were down 3.3% for the quarter, while operating income increased 2% in constant currencies. We remain focused on aggressively driving top line performance and growing market share through continued emphasis on our value platforms by accelerating growth at breakfast and by enhancing service and convenience initiatives.","Breakfast remains a significant growth opportunity for us in APMEA. Today, a large percentage of the Asian population eats breakfast away from home. But our breakfast sales as a percentage of full day sales are only 11%. That\u2019s less than half the U.S. average of 25%, which tells us the breakfast represents a significant growth opportunity in this region.","As part of a year long focus to get more consumers to think of McDonald's as a morning destination, 30 countries across APMEA participated in a National Breakfast Day promotion on March 18. 5,000 restaurants gave away 5 million of our great tasting and nutritious Egg McMuffins, and we significantly increased awareness and trial for our breakfast products.","Let\u2019s turn to APMEA\u2019s big three markets starting with Australia. Our focused efforts to balance value initiatives with promotional activities that encourage trade-up, positively contributed to first quarter results. Monopoly, which returned to Australia after a 13-year hiatus, drove Extra Value Meal sales and encouraged add-on purchases with game pieces strategically placed on drinks, fries, and deserts.","Japan\u2019s performance for the quarter was negatively impacted by the difficult economy, a declining IEO industry, and ongoing consumer sensitivity to prices and promotions. Japan continues to evaluate and adjust its plans to complement existing value initiatives with new product news that drives long-term profitable sales and guest counts.","For example, January\u2019s national Big Mac campaign resonated well with customers and was another step in our journey to rebalance our core menu pricing and promotion strategies.","In China, comparable sales decreased 4.6% for the quarter in part due to the residual effects of consumer sensitivity around the supply chain issue in the chicken industry. Even though our supply chain was not implicated. A diverse menu across multiple day parts, menu offerings, and price tiers enables us to offer a broad variety of affordable choices, which is especially critical in the current environment across Asia.","During the quarter, limited time offers, including the Mashed Potato Beef Burger and the Sausage Double Beef Burger positively contributed to performance. We\u2019re also complementing our new-menu news in China with meaningful efforts to make McDonald's even more accessible to our customers. We continue to strategically add new restaurants with a focus on Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where we\u2019re best able to effectively leverage our scale and our marketing strength.","Throughout APMEA, we are expanding our presence by building on the potential that exist in our brand extensions, especially delivery, kiosk, mid-caf\u00e9, and drive-through. As of March, about 50% of our restaurants are opened 24 hours and almost 20% offer delivery service to our customers.","As we continue to build on our firm foundation in every area of the world, our commitment to financial discipline has not wavered. We have a healthy balance sheet, the highest credit rating in the industry, and a robust business that generated $7 billion in cash from operations last year.","Our philosophy regarding the use of cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. These include strategically developing new restaurants in certain markets, modernizing our restaurants, so they\u2019re move relevant and appealing to our customers, and investing in initiatives like multiple order points or mobile ordering that increase the capacity and the convenience of our existing restaurant.","After reinvesting in the business, our second use of cash is our dividend. Our third and final use of cash is share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In closing, we recognize the challenges inherent in the macroeconomic environment and do not expect to see any significant improvements in the short-term.","And while comparisons will ease as we move through the year, it is not likely that the global IEO industry will improve dramatically. This will continue to pressure our performance. Now more than ever, we remain focused on those areas within our control to grow market share and drive future performance. We know what we need to do and we are determined to keep getting better and sharing ideas, scaling proven successes and moving even more quickly to bring winning solutions to markets around the world.","I remain confident in our business. Our system alignment, our strategies, the actions we are taking position us well to successfully navigate this environment in the near-term while profitably managing the business for the long-term.","Thank you and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Pete.","Peter J. Bensen","Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The pursuit of long-term profitable growth permeates the McDonald\u2019s system and guides our actions from the way we staff our restaurants, to the investments we make in infrastructure and technology to build capacity, to the strategic decisions we make around menu offerings, pricing and promotions.","We entered the year aware of the challenges we\u2019d face, growing comparable sales and margins. The steep first quarter lap, flatter declining IEO categories in many of our major markets and cost pressures throughout our P&L. Our business model is built around growing comparable sales to a level where we can realize margin leverage, when we don\u2019t do that as in the first quarter, our margins are significantly impacted. The good news is that we have competed effectively in environments like this before.","For now, it is the market share battle and we are determined to continue making the necessary adjustments to maintain and grow our share, because that is how we will win over the long-term. There is no single solution for driving sustained growth in value creation; rather we are pushing forward on multiple fronts, guided by the three global growth priorities under our plan to win.","The adjustments are beginning to take hold. In the first quarter, we outperformed the IEO industry in several key markets, including the U.S. as Don noted earlier. With 81% of our global restaurants franchise, our profitability is driven primarily by top line sales. The total system life sales increased 2% in constant currencies, persistent expense pressures and negative comparable sales contributed to a 50 basis point decline in first quarter combined operating margin to 29.5%.","The largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins, which rose $25 million to nearly $1.8 billion, a 2% constant currency increase. Consolidated franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points to 81.7% due to higher cost and negative comparable sales. Global company-operated margin dollars declined $58 million to $719 million for the quarter, a 7% decrease in constant currencies.","The margin percent decreased 130 basis points to 16.2% as average check growth was more than offset by higher labor, occupancy, and other operating costs. We expect margins to continue to be pressured throughout 2013, though margin decline to be less pronounced as sales comparison ease in upcoming quarters. In the U.S., company operating margins declined 140 basis points to 17.4% primarily due to higher labor and other operating expenses.","First quarter commodity costs were relatively flat. We expect increased cost pressure the rest of the year with a full-year increase in our U.S. grocery basket expected to be 1.5% to 2.5%. In terms of pricing, the U.S. entered the first quarter at about 1.5%. during the quarter, we\u2019ve replaced about half of the 120 basis points of prior year price increases that rolled off. We will continue to closely manage our pricing decisions to maintain our value proposition as we strive to grow traffic and market share.","For the full-year, food away from home is projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5%, while food at home inflation is projected to be about 50 basis points higher. For the trailing 12 months ended March 31, food away from home was up 2.3%, while food at home was up only 1%.","Turning to Europe, company-operated margins decreased 80 basis points to 16.7% due to higher labor and commodity costs and increased depreciation related to reimaging. The UK and Russia together account for almost half of Europe\u2019s total company-operated margin dollars. Europe\u2019s grocery bill was up about 2.5% in the quarter. We expect a similar increase in second quarter with the full-year increase now projected to be 2.5% to 3.5%, slightly lower than our estimate in January. Across Europe, the average price increase at the end of first quarter excluding Russia was about 1.5%. The sluggish macro economic environment coupled with the soft IEO market will limit our pricing power for the balance of the year.","In Asia\/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, company-operated margins declined 230 basis points to 14.6% due to the acceleration of new restaurant openings mainly in China along with higher labor, occupancy, and other costs throughout the segment. There is a heightened scrutiny around the quality of new store openings, ensuring that we are doing everything we can to optimize new store margins in this key growth segment.","G&A for the quarter increased modestly and was in line with our expectations. We are on track for full year G&A to increase about 2% to 3% in constant currencies, so there will be some variability between quarters. As indicated in January, the first quarter included a non-recurring tax benefit of nearly $50 million resulting in a tax rate of 30%.","Our full year guidance remains at 31% to 33%, which implies the effective tax rate will likely be at the higher end of this range in subsequent quarters. We remain committed to generating strong returns and enhancing long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to growth, driving sales increases at existing restaurants and adding profitable new units.","We continue to exercise discipline as we allocate capital and make steady progress toward our global growth priority of modernizing the customer experience through our reimaging efforts. We expect to reimage more than 1,600 restaurants this year, including about 800 in the U.S., 450 in Europe, and 225 in APMEA. Through first quarter we have completed about 250 reimages globally.","In addition, we expect to complete about 200 rebuilds in the U.S. this year. Opening new units is part of our global growth priority to broaden accessibility to our brand. We focus on strategically growing at select number of markets to have a significant potential and can generate attractive returns over the long-term. We are on track to open between 1,500 and 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about 500 an affiliated and developmental license markets.","Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.01. At current rates which reflect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted with a full-year negative impact of $0.01 to $0.02.","As you know, this is directional guidance only, because rates will change as we move throughout 2013. The external challenges we face in 2013 are in many ways similar to last year, low consumer confidence in shrinking disposable income negatively impacting consumer demand coupled with continued pressure across many expense categories.","We believe we have made the appropriate adjustments to fortify our near-term performance and we remain diligent about monitoring the environment and making further adjustments as we move throughout the year.","I\u2019m confident in the future of our great brand. McDonald's has increasingly modern restaurants in outstanding locations around the world. Best-in-class franchisees and suppliers and dedicated company employees, all aligned to drive long-term enduring profitable growth for our system and shareholders. Thanks.","Now, I\u2019ll turn over to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Chris Stent","Thanks, Pete. I will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from David Palmer of UBS.","David S. Palmer \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Two part question on Europe. You described there was a slowing going on in that market, how are you \u2013 can you just generally describe how your marketing plans are this year? How are you going to adjust this sluggish environment? I recall, last summer, you were tinkering value menus particularly in Mainland Europe market. And secondly, as you are getting closer to the end of this curve at least on the interiors in Europe, would you consider or are you thinking about refranchising that market further to be maybe more or like the U.S.? Thanks very much.","Don Thompson","Hi, David and good morning to you. There are several different points, I guess, in your question there. First of all, what have we done in Europe? Last year, we began to talk about a couple of the markets that we felt we needed to have additional focus on, those markets in being France and Germany. We talked about the fact that the southern division of Europe was really going through tough macroeconomies and that remains the same today.","However, what we have done is, in the market of France, we have changed and fortified our value offerings. We talked about Casse-Croute this morning. They solidified Petit Plaisirs. They\u2019ve done several things and that's why we\u2019re gaining share in France. If you look at the southern division, the southern division as a market, which includes Spain and Italy, and Portugal, those markets are also gaining share. So we have been performing \u2013 we\u2019re performing well relative to the overall marketplace. However, it is very soft consumer confidence there.","Relative to refranchising, what we have continued to do as we always do is look at our overall company-operated portfolio and determine whether or not we have opportunities to continue to improve that first or we have opportunities in terms of leveraging G&A, leveraging scale, improving overall operational efficiency by refranchising. We have one market; we continue to look at some of that in, which is the UK. But the other markets, we feel fairly good about the way that the portfolio is stacked up at this point in time.","Chris Stent","Okay. Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph T. Buckley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Can you talk about your comments like gaining share in the first quarter, particularly the U.S., what you think the gap between your comp number and the QSR sector might have been? And then extend that into April, I guess, the April sales commentary is a little bit more surprising given the easier comparison. So could you talk about factors that you think are influencing the April sales number?","Don Thompson","All right, Joe. I think we\u2019ll talk probably a couple of different things. One, it will be from a U.S. perspective and the other is really a global perspective. In the U.S., if you look at our comparisons to the overall competitive set, we\u2019ve outperformed the competition by about 1.4%. That's the comp gap. And so we and that\u2019s the overall competitive set. So we feel, again, that the things that we have begun to do to bring energy to the marketplace in both food and value. They are solidified, they are in place. Having said that, and we normally don\u2019t talk about weather at all, but we know in the month of April, last quarter \u2013 the first quarter of last year, we saw very favorable weather. Matter of fact, it was the best weather that we had seen in 118 years, the first quarter, through March of last year.","This year what we\u2019re seeing in the month of or the first quarter was some tough weather. We also in April, clearly, we\u2019re seeing some differences in weather. So we have to be cognizant of that. We won\u2019t use weather as an excuse because next year we don\u2019t want to use it, we\u2019re going to be comping up against it. But the reality of it is we have seen some things in weather that are there.","We still feel like from a competitive set, we\u2019re going to perform well and our marketing plans and our food \u2013 and food promotions actually are really solid. We have brought better food news and stronger value to the marketplace.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Keith Siegner of Credit Suisse.","Keith Siegner \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Thanks. Just a follow-up on that question a little bit, thinking through the headline global April outlook, and how some of these issues in China and other parts of Asia might be factoring in. I mean, there\u2019s a big information kind of vacuum right now about what\u2019s actually going on in China with chicken and other counties that might be really influencing that. If you could talk a little bit about what might you actually be seeing there and how that plays into the preliminary global April outlook? That would be very helpful. Thank you.","Don Thompson","All right, Keith. I\u2019m going to ask Tim Fenton to talk a little bit about China, because as we talk about global, our overall global sales in terms of April, there are somethings that have been emerging pieces that we\u2019ve seen that we had not seen before. One of those is avian influenza and I\u2019ll ask Tim to kind to give a little update on that and maybe even talk just a little bit about. We\u2019re coming out of one thing, which was the chicken industry and issues around antibiotics, and now we have a different piece, which is broader in impact, which is avian influenza. And so that does bear on our global sales as we look forward into April. So, Tim, if you would?","Tim Fenton","","Sure, Keith, good morning. Yes, on China, as we stated, we had a sales decline of 4.6% in the first quarter, going up against a tough first quarter last year as far as high comp, but definitely we saw a switch out of chicken consumption. Fortunately, we do have other proteins that we were able to shift people into, but as we were coming out of it and gaining some traction, obviously, came the avian influenza, which we\u2019ve been there before unfortunately and it not only has had an impact on China, it does have a potential impact on a lot of APMEA, not just China. But again, we continue to move on the different proteins that we have with beef and fish, and as course breakfast in McCafe, but we\u2019re moving with it. We\u2019re doing what we have. We\u2019re continuing to look at what we do in the restaurants from a food safety and with our suppliers, and we\u2019ve been there before, and we\u2019ll continue to move forward with our plan.","Chris Stent","Next question, Matt DiFrisco of Lazard.","Matt J. DiFrisco \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets LLC","","Thank you. I guess, just touching on some of those food promotions, Don, you were talking about earlier, relative to prior years, I guess, a lot of people have looked at in the success of your beverage product, it had multiple years and sustainability and the impressiveness of lapping big comps and putting up big comps on top of that. Are you seeing the same, I guess, in this environment of more food promotional, it seems like they are a little bit more of an LTO-ish type environment or a sense that you\u2019re not maybe holding the comp as much are they. Are you happy with that as far as how long you are \u2013 that you\u2019re holding the lift from those new introductions such as the Fish Bites and some of the Premium Chicken Wraps?","Don Thompson","Matt, great question. I think two different parts here, one is the LTO strategy and the other is those things that might become platforms and continue to be part of our course. So if you look at McWraps, McWraps for us is not a limited time offer promotion, it is one of those things that will be a platform for McDonald's as we move forward. It\u2019s been that way in Europe and performed well. We are, we feel that the performance at these early stages in the U.S. has met the expectations that we have and so we are feeling fairly good about that. I continue to say, and I hedge a little bit on my comments about, we continue to feel great about it because let\u2019s keep in mind, we\u2019re still facing a slow recovery in United States from an overall economic perspective.","And as we look across Europe, we still have high unemployment rates and higher austerity measures, but in the U.S. that is a platform. Something a little different Fish McBites, that\u2019s a limited time offer, so we\u2019ll have that come in and go out. When you talk about beverages, we will continue to post in beverage products that remind our customers of the overall beverage line up. So when we say blueberry-pomegranate as a smoothie flavor, we\u2019re also saying that we\u2019re going to remind customers of pineapple-mango and strawberry-banana. So we\u2019ll continue to do that and do it more aggressively this year than we did last year.","Chris Stent","","Next question is from Michael Kelter of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Kelter \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","So your restaurant level margins now appear to be on pace for their third straight year of declines in all three divisions in the U.S., in Europe and in Asia. And so I guess there are two parts to my question on that point. The first is, what are the specific things you are doing to turn that around or is it really just waiting for same-store sales to get better? And second, how the franchisees reacted to declining profit margins at the restaurants?","Peter J. Bensen","","Michael, it\u2019s Pete. As we\u2018ve always talked that for us margins are much more of a top line gain. So driving comps is critical to driving those margins. And in this environment where you continue to have the cost pressures, so commodities will be up, labor rates are going up et cetera, and yet you have soft economics declining to flat eating-out markets, that battle for market share becomes so critical to the long-term health of the business that we\u2019re willing to sacrifice a little bit of margin to maintain that traffic and grow the market share.","So in this environment, that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to continue to go after that, and around the world, we\u2019re generally aligned with our franchisees around that. They understand the importance of driving traffic in this environment and taking market share, because again, if the industry isn\u2019t growing, taking market share means we\u2019re taking guests from other restaurants. And in that environment, that is what we have to do to continue to win. Would we love higher margin? Yes. Would they love higher cash flow? Yes, but in this environment, guest count growth and market share growth are critical.","Chris Stent","","Next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John S. Glass \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Pete, just, and as you think about last year and this year to the point that it\u2019s a tougher environment, earnings growth is slower, margins are under pressure. One of the things you have is a balance sheet that\u2019s historically been very strong in the cash flow, which you\u2019re using, but can you just reexamine what are the likelihood of you using this very low rate environment to increase leverage maybe without even changing your credit metrics, in other words, maybe the rates are just low enough that you\u2019re going to add debt without changing your interest expense?","And secondarily, can you talk about maybe rethinking with the credit metrics you look at or the appropriate given this environment, maybe you\u2019d like to extend that. If you could just maybe help us understand what is the credit metric you look and you manage to and then secondarily, if you\u2019re willing to reexamine that?","Peter J. Bensen","John, that\u2019s a great question. One of the things we\u2019ve always talked about is the importance of maintaining our A credit rating. So you aren\u2019t going to get into the specific measures that underlie that, but as we look at our role at the franchise or that financial strength is critical for us and you\u2019re aware of our business model being co-invested with our franchisees and part of that three legged stool is a critical piece for us. So that credit rating is important and we feel the alignment created by maintaining that strong credit rating in our financial health is more valuable to shareholders than some kind of one-time leverage event would be.","That being said, as you\u2019ve noticed each of the last few years, we continue to augment our free cash flow return to shareholders by increasing the debt on our balance sheet. And we will continue to do that again this year, but my guess is that it\u2019ll probably be at a level below what we added last year.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David E. Tarantino \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.","Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up on all the margin commentary and the pressures that you\u2019re seeing; Pete, could you give us an idea of what type of comp would be needed to hold on to either the restaurant margins or the EBIT \u2013 companywide EBIT margin for this year and maybe talk a little bit about how the greater emphasis on value is maybe changing or not changing that equation?","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, David. We\u2019ve historically said 2% to 3% comp would allow us to hold margin and we\u2019ve kind of said that\u2019s in a normal environment. And we\u2019ve defined that as being commodity cost in that 2% to 3% range, but also getting half of that growth from average check and half of that growth from guest count. So when you\u2019re in an environment today where we are going from, more of the sales growth is coming from guest counts than it is from check growth, that puts pressure on that equation. And we are seeing other cost increases in the labor line, additional deprecation, et cetera that are \u2013 that weren\u2019t in our normal environment kind of calculation, which obviously points to a higher than 2% to 3% comp in this environment to maintain or grow the margins.","Don Thompson","David, just another point, keep in mind please too also that the value aspect of our menu is still in the range of 10% to 15%. So we haven\u2019t seen some huge upsurge relative to the mix of value-based products. The reason that you\u2019ve heard us talk so much about product mix and new food news is because one of the things that we are doing around the world is ensuring that we have promotional food and new food that also is accretive to overall cash flow in the restaurants. And that also helps us quite a bit and that helps us to move average check.","A challenge that we have and we talked about in our earlier comments is the fact that if inflation is not as high, we don't have as much pricing power. And so when you think about the overall margin, clearly it's still demand, which we focus on the demand base, it\u2019s still the average check components, pricing is a little softer in terms of what we can take and it's been the trade-up aspects, which is why we focus on the new menu aspects in our core in those larger sandwiches. So we are managing all of that and Tim is ensuring that around the world, those things are part of our plans.","Chris Stent","","Next question is from Will Slabaugh of Stephens.","Will E. Slabaugh \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Yeah, thanks, guys. I had a question on the product pipeline, and you mentioned a couple of items you rolled out recently. I wanted to just more broadly how you describe your pipeline now in terms of breadth of products and then also in the length of the timeline for rolling them out versus last year and then also maybe versus historically, if you would? Thank you.","Don Thompson","","I would \u2013 and I\u2019ll ask Tim to also comment about some of the things that he\u2019s seeing in some of the product pipelines around the world. I would tell you today, our product pipeline is more robust from a global perspective and the other aspect of this is, we are moving products around the world at a much quicker pace, which is also evidence of one of the questions earlier about limited time offers. It may appear that we have more of those only because you\u2019re seeing some of the new food news that\u2019s been coming from different markets around the world. But there are several products and platforms and product areas that we have felt \u2013 we feel like we\u2019re in a pretty strong place with continue to develop, but, Tim, maybe some of the things you\u2019ve seen across Europe and now in the U.S.","Tim Fenton","Sure. One of the strategies we\u2019ve had is to really all the new products coming in 2013 to have at least 40% to 50% of them coming form our existing new product pipeline. Great products travel well across different borders and I think a good example is the McWraps right now that are going in the U.S., of course, to go in, in Canada shortly.","You compare second quarter of this year in the U.S., the last year we\u2019ve got a very robust product line with the McWraps, the Blueberry Pomegranate Smoothie coming in. But we\u2019re also seeing smoothies travel across the system in test in many countries in APMEA as well as in Europe. So I think overall, our overall product development, we\u2019re doing more with existing products we had in different countries and really scaling those and we\u2019re finding out that great products travel real easily across different country borders.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Michael Tamas \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","Thanks. This is Mike Tamas on for Brian. Just have a follow-up on an earlier question. Can you just talk about the food margin kind of going forward? Should we expect the same kind of leverage that we saw this quarter or since inflation is going to pick up a little bit in the out quarters versus 1Q, which did actually look like a little deleverage here? Thanks.","Peter J. Bensen","Hey, Mike, it\u2019s Pete. In my remarks I addressed that. We don\u2019t typically give margin forecast. But we think the decline of a 130 basis points in this first quarter is about as bad as it could get this year and that subsequent quarters, we should see declines in our debt severe.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein at Barclays.","Jeff A. Bernstein \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you very much. Just two actual follow-ups on answers you previously gave. One, I was just wondering, Pete, you talked about kind of the balance sheet and taking on incremental debt over the past couple of years. I\u2019m just wondering how you think about the balance of the dividend versus the share repo. It seems like dividend is higher up on the hierarchy. So I\u2019m wondering why whether that\u2019s considered to boost up significantly. And then the other follow-up was just the market share comment you guys made in terms of the U.S., I'm wondering if you can lay that in terms of how it looks in Europe. It sounds like UK and Russia might be slowing a little bit. We know Germany and France is already slow. So I\u2019m just wondering whether your peers are suffering more than you or how you look at the gap between yourselves and them? Thanks.","Peter J. Bensen","","Jeff, regarding the use of cash, nothing has changed in our philosophy. So after we invest in the business, we commit to returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time. And the dividend is our first priority and continues to be. And when you look at \u2013 going back to my earlier comment, when you talk about our credit metrics, one of the rating agencies looks at that dividend as a fixed commitment.","So as we continue to increase that dividend, that\u2019s kind of added to our existing credit on our balance sheet which is one of the things that they limit to our rating in one of the agency\u2019s models.","Don Thompson","All right, Jeff, relative to market share, if you looked at our top seven markets, we are slack to growing share in six of the seven. So, and this is something that we feel and again, I hesitate to use the word comfortable because we\u2019re not comfortable with our results. But we feel that the plans are appropriate that our markets have put in place. And so we have actually been trending positively relative to gaining market share around the world and we know our plans are stronger in 2013.","Chris Stent","","Next question is from Jeff Omohundro of Davenport.","Jeff F. Omohundro \u2013 Davenport Securities","Thanks. I just wondered if you could discuss the domestic reimaging program both in terms results versus expectations, and the pacing of the reimage program. Does this macro environment impact franchisee\u2019s receptivity to it? How do you think about that to the balance of the year?","Peter J. Bensen","Yeah, Jeff, we think we\u2019re going to do about another 800 reimages this year in the U.S. That will as of the end of the year \u2013 as of the end of the quarter here, we\u2019ve got about roughly 40% of the U.S. done interiors and exteriors. And that 800 that we have in the pipeline this year, those are committed, signed up deals that we have in the pipeline. So we have a pretty good line of visibility into that. And while, again, to my earlier comments, we\u2019d love to see margins growing, and sales growing at a faster rate. But these reimage decisions are longer term business building decisions and not an individual quarter or two type decision. So we can\u2019t turn them on and turn them off on a dime and I think it\u2019s important that we continue to make progress on those.","Tim Fenton","","And Jeff, this is Tim. Four weeks ago, the U.S. just had their Combined Manager and Operator Rally. They have it every other year out in Vegas where we have \u2013 you bring together over 18,000 owner-operators and managers and staff. I attended one of those and I can tell you that the interest and the energy on reimaging is as high as it\u2019s ever been. A lot of positive comments, a lot of momentum going into it, so nothing is \u2013 the energy has not waned off at all, if anything it\u2019s moving forward.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jason West of Deutsche Bank.","Jason T. West \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, guys. Just going back to the question around the IEO markets around the world, I just want to understand the commentary. Are you guys saying that you\u2019ve seen another leg down in sort of the overall macro in certain places like the UK and Russia or is it just sort of stabilized at a low level, if you could talk a bit more about the trend there? And then when do we lap kind of the slowdown that we saw last year? Has that happened yet in some of your core markets or is that really something that we haven\u2019t lapped yet and we could get to that maybe May, June timeframe?","Don Thompson","","Hi, Jason. Just a couple of pieces on the IEO. So if you\u2019re looking at overall IEO projections in terms of 2013, of those same seven markets that I talked about, four out of those seven markets are contracting. When you expand that outside of the top seven markets into to, say the top 20 markets, you have another host of markets that are flat or contracting. So we\u2019ve got quite a few markets there where we see the IEO not growing at what we would consider to be an aggressive pace or a more healthy pace. Even those that are growing typically are growing maybe in the 1 percentile range. And so IEO has been soft in terms of growth.","Having said that, we realize that our growth is going to come from taking market share and our plans whether they\u2019d be value based, whether they\u2019d be new product based, the operational execution satisfying the needs of customers each and everyday, opening up our operating hours and windows, all of those things are fashioned at us capturing more market share.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andy Barish of Jefferies","Andy M. Barish \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, a quick question just trying to get a sense of recent trends. It seemed as if mix was negative and then if you kind of look at the first quarter numbers where you talked about negative traffic and pricing of roughly 0.5 or maybe a little bit more, it seems like mix was flat to maybe even a little bit positive, even with the reemphasized value focus. Is there something that\u2019s changed here or something additional that I\u2019m missing?","Peter J. Bensen","","Andy, it\u2019s Pete. The mix across kind of all of the three major geographies was down slightly in the first quarter. So we had as you indicated, we had the price, which was positive, we had a slight drag from mix, and the slight drag from the guest counts.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Mitch Speiser of Buckingham Research.","Mitch Speiser \u2013 Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thanks very much. And I just want to ask a question about the global high yield market, whether it\u2019s the top ten markets that you\u2019re in or the top 20. When we think about it, is it just truly cyclical as the reason why it\u2019s flat to declining? Could you may be talk about if there is any structural issues as well? It just seems like eating out it seems to be what people do as economies improve. Yes, the economies are soft, but if there is any competitive issues or any structural issues that are limiting the global eating out market from growing? Thanks.","Don Thompson","","Hi, Mitch. I don\u2019t know if I would call them structural. I will call them basically just human behavior and consumer behavior. consumer confidence is down in many of the markets around the world. And as a result, when consumer confidence is down, clearly, then discretionary spending is typically down. And so when we look at whether it\u2019d be, again, the U.S. with slower recovery, if we look at the last retail sales reports that we had, those being softer, GDP revisions around the world across Europe, still high unemployment rates across Europe, particularly teen unemployment rates, many of these things are the reasons that as we went through last year, we talked about trying to solidify value messages last year so that as we came into this year, we would not see further erosion to Pete\u2019s point earlier.","Having said that, we still need top line basically to help us deliver in terms of the margin as Pete pointed out earlier. But there\u2019s nothing structural, I would say, it\u2019s just consumer confidence is softer. The only that is outside of that is when you look across APMEA and you look at 60% to 70% of our consumers in that geography favor chicken as a protein, particularly in markets like China and Japan, some of those Asian markets. And you have scares like avian influenza or antibiotic issues and food safety issues; then clearly that impacts our business. but those are shorter-term impacts; they\u2019re not structural as well.","So, I think what we\u2019re faced with is whether or not overall local economies and macroeconomies will start to trend better. When that begins to happen, we\u2019re in a good position to benefit from it.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer \u2013 Wells Fargo Advisors LLC","Great, thanks. Sorry to do this, but I did want to take another crack at margins. It looks like the U.S. has seen something like three consecutive quarters of, I guess, roughly a 140 basis points of pressure. I\u2019m just curious what color you can provide on the pressure resulting from things like the heightened focus on promoting values, softer same-store sales, even the commodity and labor pressure. And I guess the alternate question here is which of those three have had the greatest influence on that margin pressure?","Peter J. Bensen","Yes. as Don alluded to this earlier, the value component of our sales in the U.S. continues to be at a relatively similar position. So it\u2019s not as if our Dollar Menu percentage has gone from 13% to 14% to 20%. It has remained relatively stable. What you do see sometimes in these softer economic environments is a little bit in the mix. So I mentioned the product mix was slightly negative to the sales. But we do have a fixed cost base in there that if you aren\u2019t generating the comparable sales, the fixed cost from our management labor from our depreciation, from our third-party rent that obviously is impacted.","And if you look through the categories, there is not one of those expense categories that particularly jumps out as being so much more significantly larger than any of the others. So across all of those kind of categories I mentioned, 10 to 20 basis point impact when they\u2019re all going in the same direction, because you can\u2019t leverage the comps, that\u2019s where you get the larger pressure.","Don Thompson","And Jeff, if you \u2013 going back to Pete\u2019s comments earlier relative to price, he mentioned that one of the price increases from last year at about 120 basis points came off. We replaced that with about 60 basis points. The reason for that is, because consumers are very sensitive to price. And so we don\u2019t have the inflationary environment or the consumer sentiment environment to go out and take the same kind of price increases that historically we did. We do believe that this is not a structural kind of a change. We think that it is based upon the economy at this point. The second point I\u2019d make is, when we think about trade-off, things like McWraps, products like McWraps, thus far in the month of April and as we\u2019ve launched this product, we\u2019ve been driving awareness.","So you\u2019ve seen a lot of things in the marketplace with $2 McWraps and different things to try to get those in the hands and mouths of customers. As we move forward, it goes to the full price, which is in the $4 range. So, while we may not get the same unit movement, we will have and see a little bit better margin on that product.","So these are all other things that go in a hopper as we continue to manage both margins and also sales success without having guest count erosion.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John W. Ivankoe \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you. Just that, I think a slightly different take in what\u2019s been a pretty consistent theme overall margins. There is a really interesting sentence actually in, basically the front of your press release that says the U.S. is focused on menu and convenience initiatives to drive sales and restaurant profitability.","And it\u2019s that restaurant profitability piece that I think is interesting, because it almost suggests that that you\u2019re planning on growing restaurant profitability in 2013 in the U.S. while increasing attention on the Dollar Menu and especially increasing attention on the Dollar Menu with some of your competitor have by that definition, backed off. So that\u2019s something that I want to get a sense of is, did franchisees push back on you saying that, the 2012 store level cash flow is something that they don\u2019t want to see go down anymore, it\u2019s kind of the first point.","And then secondly, just thinking about from a company store perspective, from a McOpCo perspective, do you think 2013 is a year of investment on the consumer to allow margins to go down willingly or should we expect at the end of the year that restaurant profitability can actually be up?","Don Thompson","I\u2019ll ask Pete to touch based on both points relative to the cash flows and also just the overall notion on restaurant profitability.","Peter J. Bensen","Yes. John, actually in 2012 owner-operator cash flow was up in the U.S. So this is not \u2013 what we try to convey with that kind of was the fact that while yes, it is a market share battle out there and we know that growing traffic in that environment is very important. And we know that price sensitivity is a little greater. At the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a line-up of products over the summer and the rest of the year that have the potential to improve where we are relative to the first quarter.","So, again, in my remarks, I said that while the margin declined to 130 basis points in the first quarter, we expect as move throughout the year that the decline should be less severe that in part is driven by the expectation also that the sales comparison get easier. So implying that we expect because of the sales comparison is easing, we\u2019ll get a little bit more of that top line leverage. And we\u2019re not at a point where we\u2019re going to say that we\u2019re going to get enough leverage to actually kind of grow the margins, but it\u2019s still going to continue to be a market share battle and we feel good as Don said about our product line-ups and our ability to drive some more sales.","Tim Fenton","And John, this is Tim. Just to add with the new products coming with wraps and beverage and breakfast, all higher margins for us as well as focus on beef going on for the second half of the year, all higher margin products.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Sara Senatore of Sanford Bernstein.","Sara H. Senatore \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. Just a two follow-ups if I may. One is on the top line and it was something, I think that Pete just said about the idea that improving trends against easier comparisons. We didn\u2019t really see that in April, even though comparisons I think are substantially easier than in March. And I guess, I wanted to talk about, when you\u2019re framing that in that context. So I guess what I\u2019m hearing is that, comparisons get easier, we wouldn\u2019t expect to see sort of a symmetrical bounce back versus last year, but maybe just some incremental improvements sequentially. I just wanted to clarify that outlook.","And then the second follow-up was on China. Some other margin pressure in APMEA obviously is coming from new unit growth in China. I would have thought with the push towards more developmental license and franchising that we would \u2013 that that would diminish, is that a reasonable expectation going forward or is that drag going to persist for a while?","Don Thompson","Hi Sara, I\u2019ll take the shot at the first part, and then Pete will answer you at the second part of your question. So relative to April, here\u2019s the things that we\u2019re seeing out there. We understand the existing issues that have been there. We understand the slower recoveries I mentioned earlier. we understand some of the more consistent macroeconomic pressures that pressure consumer confidence. So, as we rolled through the first quarter and as we move into April, we expect some of the high comps that we have, we\u2019re rolling across those.","So on that end, we feel better about the overall environment moving forward. Having said that, those macroeconomic pressures still persist and we\u2019re seeing emerging issues that pop up, things like again, we mentioned avian influenza. We\u2019re continuing to see some of the unemployment levels that have continued to increase. Some of the economies are worsening a bit, i.e., France, I mean, they\u2019re seeing the worst economy since World War II. So we\u2019re seeing certain aspects that are worsening a little bit. What does it mean for us? It simply means that the exact plans that we have today, we have to focus on those and focus even harder and we\u2019ve got those inherent in the plans that we have around the world.","So we see some positives that are occurring. We see some potential negatives that are occurring, and ours is just to continue to emphasize the plans that we have in place to be able to continue to drive consumers or bring consumers into restaurant and drive business performance forward.","Peter J. Bensen","","And Sara, regarding the new store margins and our franchisees, we only have 151 of our restaurants franchised in China, so compared to our base of over 1,700. So it\u2019s less than 10% of our restaurants that are franchised there. So, while yes, directionally, that is a positive, it\u2019s still relative to the base not going to be a significant driver. But as I mentioned, there is a lot of work going on around what is the optimal cost to operate those new restaurants. So as we look at the investment levels, making sure that we\u2019re sizing the investment for the current sales opportunity, yet leaving the flexibility there to build for future demand as those trade areas grow. So that it\u2019s getting a lot of focus and attention and as we, as you know, with comps being negative in the quarter, that is a continued drag not only on the new stores, but on all the stores there.","Chris Stent","We have time for one more question, which will be from R. J. Hottovy of Morningstar.","R. J. Hottovy \u2013 Morningstar Research","Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask a quick question about APMEA and specifically, Japan. Really in your mind, what will it take to get that market turnaround, especially now that we\u2019re lapping about two years of negative results in the territory as well as some reports of some price increases in the region, just wanted to get a sense of your outlook for Japan in particular?","Tim Fenton","Yeah. This is Tim, R.J. First of all, Japan has been one of our most difficult IEO markets as far as negative IEO. We took it on as a special projects just going and really evaluating and segmenting our business. We have revamped our value campaigns, our product lines, and actually have seen a good trending force is trending up in the last couple of months is you\u2019ll read soon.","As far as the pricing, I think what you may have read and it was a little bit taken out of context. We are adjusting some prices on our value menu if you will, bringing up a hamburger and a cheeseburger, at the same time, balancing out and bringing down the price of regular fry and some other products. I think the overall price increase and we haven\u2019t taken a price increase since 2008 was just a little over a 1% blended. But a very difficult market, we are encouraged what we\u2019re seeing as of late on changing some of the trajectory of the business.","Chris Stent","All right. we\u2019re about out of time. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Don who has a few closing comments.","Don Thompson","Well, thanks everyone again for participating with us this morning. And as we wrap up the call, again, really want to appreciate the questions and your thoughts and support of the business. We remain committed to our long-term strategies as we make thoughtful and strategic decisions to mitigate what we hopefully have informed you of, relative to short-term pressures in these challenging times.","Notwithstanding these pressures we\u2019re experiencing today, we remain very confident in our future. We have defensible competitive advantages, a resilient business model, and the alignment across our owner-operator suppliers and the company teams to drive enduring and profitable growth for the long-term for our system and our shareholders despite some of the challenges that are being represented and we see around the world. So we remain confident and again, thanks for your participation this morning. And have a great day everyone."],"13816":["McDonald's Corp.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are: President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","And now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Midway through 2016, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made in turning around our business and the way we've challenged legacy thinking, acted with greater urgency, and shared successes more quickly across markets. These actions underlie the positive momentum that continued in second quarter, marking four consecutive quarters of positive comparable sales growth across all segments and franchisee cash flows at all-time highs in many markets.","More specifically, global comparable sales increased 3.1% for the quarter. Operating income was up 3% in constant currencies, and earnings per share was up 1% in constant currencies. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year strategic charges, earnings per share for the quarter was up 13% in constant currencies.","As we enter 2016, we expected quarterly results to be variable throughout the year. Our top-line performance in second quarter, while positive, reflects slower growth, due, in part, to challenging conditions in several countries.","I'm encouraged that we continue to win relative to our QSR competitors in key markets around the world. In the U.S., our comparable sales gap versus the QSR sandwich segment was consistently positive and averaged 130 basis points for the quarter, despite softer industry growth. Our balanced focus on All Day Breakfast, value and relevant promotions, including MONOPOLY, contributed to top-line performance.","In Australia, Canada and the U.K., we are gaining significant market share within the IEO segment and, in particular, relative to our traditional QSR competitors. Our formula for success in these markets is consistent: commitment to running great restaurants, coupled with initiatives that create customer excitement across our menu, promotion and value offers, all supported by strong alignment with franchisees.","Early last year, we put the customer back at the center of everything we're doing. That mindset ignited our turnaround and continues to guide our decision-making, as evidenced by the enhancements we are making to the All Day Breakfast menu in the U.S., the leadership moves we've made around sustainability, and the significant progress we're making to create a more modern customer experience as part of the Experience of the Future.","Over the past few quarters, we've heard from customers looking for more choice in the All Day Breakfast menu. Those with muffin sandwiches on the menu asked for biscuits. Those with biscuit sandwiches on the menu asked for muffins. We listened, worked through the operational challenges, and this fall, we'll begin offering muffins, biscuits and McGriddles all day in all U.S. restaurants.","Under the broader food quality umbrella, we continue to take a leadership stance of sustainability because it's the right thing to do for our business, society and the world at large. In Canada, we are breaking ground in the beef industry with our recently concluded sustainable beef pilots, part of our work with ranchers and larger producers around the globe to measure and track sustainable beef from farm to fork. Sustainability matters to our customers, and it matters to us.","At the same time, Experience of the Future is quickly coming to light in key markets around the world. For example, in Canada, over half of our restaurants have been fully converted. The U.K. is almost 40%, and France is at nearly 25% with table service in about 80% of restaurants. This marks significant progress from where we were just three months ago.","Customers are noticing the steps we're taking to build a better McDonald's. The most recent customer satisfaction scores reflect improvements in seven of our nine largest markets. In the U.S., we are seeing further evidence of improved brand perceptions according to a recent YouGov report that measures consumer perceptions across 1,400 brands. McDonald's was ranked fourth most improved brand across all brands measured, and the most improved within QSR.","We're taking smart risks to address what matters most to customers. We're also being smarter about our structure and resources and prioritizing our activities to deliver the greatest impact. This includes putting more restaurants in the hands of dedicated franchisees, getting us closer to the customers and communities we serve, and unleashes more entrepreneurial spirit, risk-taking and innovation across the system, ultimately accelerating growth.","At the same time, we're further streamlining how we operate. We're in the midst of rightsizing our organization, taking a critical look at how we can reduce layers to be more agile in our decision-making. We also recently announced the relocation of our corporate headquarters. Our new location will support greater collaboration and innovation, help us better attract and retain talent and move us toward a more modern, progressive culture with the added benefit of reducing costs. These are all important steps forward in our journey to building a better McDonald's.","With that context, let's now turn to performance highlights in our major markets. Beginning with the U.S., comparable sales for the second quarter increased 1.8%. Whilst modestly positive, this growth was not as strong as the last two quarters. This is due, in part, to the recent softening of the IEO industry, which experienced minimal growth for the trailing 12-month period ending in May at only 40 basis points.","The All Day Breakfast platform continues to contribute to top-line momentums that draw new customers into our restaurants and creates additional reasons for existing customers to visit more often. It's also delivering bottom-line growth, with restaurant-level cash flows up for the third consecutive quarter. Franchisees are excited about the platform and its future growth potential. And the next phase of All Day Breakfast, which I mentioned earlier, was voted in with an overwhelming approval rating exceeding 99%.","With food, we continue to enhance quality perceptions around our core menu. And we're being more vocal about the improvements we've made. Just last week, we launched our new brand campaign called The Simpler the Better, which highlights the progress we've made in the areas that matter most to our customers. And we'll have even more news to share in the coming weeks.","Value remains a top priority in the U.S. Franchisees have embraced the McPick 2 value platform at both the national and local levels. We're tapping into the flexibility this platform provides in terms of products and price points to enhance our appeal to a broader population of value-seeking customers, which is increasingly important given softer IEO industry trends.","Although the progress we've made in the U.S. is encouraging, our most significant opportunity continues to be bringing customers into our restaurants more often. As such, we are actively exploring new ways to increase the frequency of visits from our loyal customers and win back customers we've lost.","Let's now turn to the International Lead segment. Second quarter comparable sales increased 2.6%, with four of the top five markets delivering positive comparable sales for the quarter. France was the exception, with results that were relatively flat. Whilst the recent Brexit vote has created uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe, our business remains strong. And we are confident in our ability to manage through the change.","Having operated in these markets for over 40 years, we're accustomed to dealing with external challenges and believe we are well-positioned to seek out the opportunities it provides to build upon the strength of our U.K. business. And, in fact, the U.K. market's long track record of success continued into second quarter. Compelling promotions, limited time offers, such as the relaunch of Big Flavour Wraps, and positive performance from Experience of the Future restaurants drove growth in both average check and guest counts, with guest count volume breaking all-time monthly highs in April and May.","In Canada, our continued focus on lunch, along with successful marketing campaigns and positive performance from their Experience of the Future restaurants, drove solid sales and guest count momentum into the second quarter.","The performance of All Day Breakfast in Australia is mirroring the success in the U.S., driving incremental sales while providing customers with even more reasons to visit McDonald's. In addition, we continue to fuel growth in more established platforms like Experience of the Future and McCaf\u00e9. We're introducing new customizable flavors and ingredients supported by engaging marketing and promotional campaigns to create energy and excitement for our customers.","Sales were slightly positive in Germany for the second quarter. With a heavy concentration of price conscious customers, value remains a critical priority. The new pricing structure we rolled out in February continues to perform in line with expectations. And McPick 2 for \u20ac5, which we launched in May, resonated well with customers. However, these initiatives weren't enough to mitigate ongoing guest count and market share declines.","Macroeconomic challenges persist in France. We're enhancing our appeal to customers by offering more compelling options at lower tiers of our menu. We're also pursuing growth opportunities at the premium end through engaging promotions and limited time offers, including the recent New York Street Food Event, which successfully drove sales of premium burgers and wraps.","In the High Growth segment, second quarter comparable sales were up 1.6%, driven by positive performance in China and Russia. Despite a challenging environment, including aggressive discounting by competitors, China's comparable sales were up 2.1% for the quarter. We continue to gain significant market share in IEO and, more specifically, from Chinese QSRs, whilst undertaking meaningful cost savings initiatives to enhance profitability in this important market.","In an effort to give customers more reasons to choose McDonald's, we've introduced appealing new products like the chicken snack sharing box. In addition, we're expanding our delivery business by tapping into growing digital channels, as well as other vendors, to offer added convenience to Chinese customers.","In Russia, comparable sales remain positive, driven, in part, by successful promotions that showcase compelling, affordable menu options across multiple dayparts and product categories. Results may be volatile moving forward, given continuing macroeconomic uncertainties and lower consumer purchasing power.","I'm encouraged by our continued progress. We're creating a better McDonald's, ones that customers will recognize as modern and progressive and a true global leader. Whilst we've come a long way, we recognize there is much more to do. That's why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year. For now, we remain focused on continuing to win within the QSR segment as we give customers more reasons choose McDonald's. At the same time, we are taking steps to build upon the progress we've made as we chart our long-term strategic path forward within the broader $1.2 trillion informal eating out market. I am confident McDonald's will generate long-term value for both our system and our shareholders.","Thanks. I'll now turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As follow-up to Steve's remarks, I'd like to cover the key performance drivers for the quarter, provide an update on our outlook for the second half of 2016, and outline the recent progress we've made against our financial initiatives.","Starting with the performance drivers for the quarter, for the quarter as a whole, we're pleased with our efforts to effectively manage restaurant profitability, particularly in light of the industry trends and economic factors that we've experienced in certain markets. With more than 80% of our global restaurants franchised, the largest driver of operating income continues to be our franchise margins.","For the quarter, growth in global franchise margins was led by the U.S. and the International Lead markets. Franchise margins totaled $1.9 billion, a 6% increase in constant currencies and contributed about $100 million to our global operating income growth for the quarter.","Growth in global company-operated margins also contributed to quarterly results, as margins rose 150 basis points, with China leading the overall improvement. In the U.S., company-operated margins increased by 30 basis points for the quarter, as positive comparable sales and favorable commodity costs more than offset the investment we made last July to raise crew wages and enhance benefits for our restaurant employees. Given the magnitude of this investment, the improvement in second quarter margins is a noteworthy achievement for our U.S. business.","Moving on to G&A, our second quarter expenses increased 2% in constant currencies, due to higher incentive-based compensation as a result of our year-to-date performance, as well as costs associated with our biennial owner\/operator convention in April. Excluding these items, G&A would have decreased.","Looking ahead, third quarter G&A levels will remain elevated, due to our sponsorship of the Summer Olympic Games in Rio next month. Taken together, the cost of our worldwide convention and the Olympics are expected to total about $25 million, or roughly 1% of our G&A in 2016. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect G&A in constant currencies to be 1% to 2% below prior year spending levels, excluding changes in incentive-based compensation and any impact from changes in timing of certain refranchising transactions.","Global operating income for the quarter totaled more than $1.8 billion, up 3% in constant currencies, reflecting roughly $230 million in strategic charges recorded during the quarter. These charges were comprised of non-cash impairment related to our ongoing refranchising in Asia and Europe and G&A initiatives, as well as the decision to relocate our corporate offices.","Diluted earnings per share for the quarter declined $0.01, which included $0.20 related to the strategic charges and $0.02 in negative foreign currency impacts. As a reminder, in second quarter 2015, we had strategic charges of $0.04 per share related to restructuring. Excluding the impact of the current and prior year restructuring charges, earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were up 13% in constant currencies.","Turning next to menu pricing and commodity costs, in the U.S., commodity costs declined 4.5% during the second quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect commodity costs to remain favorable, maintaining our outlook for the segments' full year basket of goods to be down 3.5% to 4.5%.","Commodity costs for the International Lead segment were down about 1% for the second quarter and are expected to remain relatively flat during the second half of this year.","Where possible, we source products in local currency to minimize cost fluctuations. And our suppliers also hedge a portion of foreign currency exposure. So at least in the near-term, we don't expect Brexit to significantly impact U.K. commodity prices.","While we are benefiting from favorable commodity costs around the world, we are facing rising labor costs in many of our markets. As a result, we are carefully balancing price increases with a focus on maintaining our strong value proposition, which remains a key pillar of McDonald's brand, to drive guest counts. In the U.S., second quarter pricing year-over-year was up about 3% compared with food away from home inflation of 2.6%.","Given the widening gap between food at home and food away from home inflation in the U.S., we continue to track both of these metrics very closely. As it stands, food at home is projected to increase modestly from relatively flat to up about 1% for the full year, while food away from home inflation is projected to increase between 2.5% and 3.5%.","For the International Lead segment, while price increases vary by market, year-over-year increases for these markets averaged 1.5% to 2%.","Next, I'd like to provide an update on the impact of Brexit and our global foreign currency outlook. As I mentioned, we don't expect Brexit to have a significant impact on our near-term commodity prices in the U.K. And, as Steve noted earlier, we also haven't seen a significant change in consumer demand in the U.K. since the vote. While the long-term impact of Brexit is uncertain, in the near-term, the most significant impact on our business will be currency translation.","We view our geographic diversification as a key competitive strength. For perspective, the U.K. represents about 10% of consolidated operating income and the Eurozone collectively represents about 25%. Given recent currency fluctuations, foreign currency translation is now expected to have a more significant impact on our reported results than previously estimated. Based on current exchange rates, we project foreign currency translation to negatively impact our earnings per share by $0.02 to $0.04 in the third quarter and $0.09 to $0.11 for the full year. As always, please take our currency guidance as directional only, because rates will change as we move throughout the year.","Beyond the currency impact, we continue to expect variability in quarterly results, due to increased volatility in the evolving global economic and geopolitical landscape, as well as uneven prior year comparisons.","It was just over a year ago, beginning with the announcement of our turnaround plan in May 2015, that we began reshaping our business, from our organizational structure and restaurant ownership mix, to our capital structure and the strategic allocation of our resources around the world.","We've taken decisive actions to pursue each of these opportunities, and we continue to make meaningful progress. In the past six quarters, we've refranchised about 850 restaurants, including over 160 in the second quarter. The large majority of restaurants refranchised to-date were sold to existing conventional franchisees. Overall, our global refranchising efforts are moving along as expected, and we're pleased with the progress we've made to-date.","It's important to keep in mind that due to the unique nature and scope of the refranchising activity underway, the more complex, larger refranchising transactions do take time. We remain committed to our refranchising strategy and the benefits that will be realized by moving to a more heavily franchised system for McDonald's globally.","From a G&A standpoint, we remain on track to achieve our net annual savings target of $500 million by 2018, with the vast majority of the savings expected to be realized by the end of 2017. As Steve noted, we are in the midst of transforming our organization. We expect to share more detail on the role that our organizational restructuring is playing in reaching our G&A goal as part of our third quarter earnings update.","Relative to our capital structure, 2016 represents the final year of our three-year $30 billion cash returned to shareholders target. During the second quarter, we repurchased $3.4 billion of stock, bringing our year-to-date share repurchases to $7.1 billion, or 57 million shares. In May, we completed a $2.7 billion accelerated share repurchase program and also entered into a new $2.6 billion program, which accounted for a significant portion of the share repurchase activity completed during second quarter.","Through June 2016, the cumulative cash returned under our three-year target stands at $24.4 billion, and we are on track to complete the remaining amount during the back half of this year.","We've delivered positive results over the last four quarters, not just from improving efficiency and working to reduce costs, but, most importantly, from top-line growth as we've made strides improving the customer experience. These results reinforce my confidence that we're focused on the right things.","We're also making good progress on all of the actions we outlined last year. We're actively refranchising restaurants, building stronger G&A discipline, and returning more cash to shareholders. The strategic changes we're making and the actions we've taken over the course of the last year are positioning us to optimize our business operations and deliver sustained, profitable growth.","Thanks. Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Instructions] The first question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks for taking the question. Two questions, one on the U.S. industry and one on your guys own U.S. business; on the industry, your outperformance against the industry this quarter is very similar to last quarter, which suggests the entire industry saw a huge deceleration, around 350 basis points. So what do you believe, sitting in your seat looking at the United States, what are the two largest drivers of the softening in the IEO trend? And do you see it continuing into the rest of the year?","And secondly, on your own business, when you look at lapping All Day Breakfast in the fourth quarter, how are you thinking about the ability to sustain positive trends here as you lap that? Is extending the All Day Breakfast menu enough or are there more initiatives required in your mind? Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brian. So on the first one, on the industry, well, clearly, it's been fairly well documented on the consumer slowdown across most consumer segments, to be honest with you, through the second quarter. And therefore, we are very mindful of our competitive position, the competitive gap. So it was important to us that we maintain that competitive advantage and fought for market share. We're not immune from what's happening in the outside world at all, but nor are we letting that deflect our focus on what really matters to us and our customers.","I think the general sense is there's a couple of things at play. I mean, first of all, there is a widening gap between food away from home and food at home, where the commodity decreases are being passed through by the grocers. So the food at home, there's value to be had for families there, whereas eating out, there is a price inflation environment. So that's a small part of it.","I think generally, there's just a broader level of uncertainty in consumers' minds at the moment, both trying to gauge their financial security going forward, you know, whether through elections or through global events, people are slightly mindful of an unsettled world. And when people are uncertain, when families are uncertain, caution starts to prevail and they start to hold back on spend.","And for a business like us, I mean, clearly, we generate a lot of our own business directly, but also we do benefit from people moving around, going to the malls, driving around, going on vacations. And if people are reining in their spend across broader categories, that will have a little bit of a flow-through to us as well. So we're mindful of it. It just means we've got to be closer to our customers than ever and adapt and make sure that we're building compelling plans in the short-term as well as the long.","In terms of sustaining trends, well, clearly, we plan to grow our business. But at the same time, we're not trying to do that on a quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter basis. We are mindful of the short-term, but we have our eye aligned (28:19) on the long-term. And we believe we've got a number of the right drivers in place to give us sustained long-term growth here in the U.S.","Our value platform, we continue to learn. So for a McPick 2 for $5, for example, we had our second national campaign in May. And we learned more about it in terms of the items we could have within the bundle and how we position that, all the way through to some of the early markets where we're testing out the Experience of the Future in the U.S., where we're making a significant and exciting rollout program in Florida and certainly within New York as well, which we believe the results there may mirror what we're seeing elsewhere in our other major markets, provide a very exciting opportunity across the next few years in the U.S. as well. So mindful of the short-term, we're going to fight for share, but also, we don't want to lose the strategic direction that we believe is right for long-term.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Steve, you had some comments about improving consumer perceptions in most of your major markets. Does that include the U.S. and what measures are getting better? Where does the opportunity still remain to improve? And then which of your initiatives do you think are really going to help you get where you want to get with your brand, with the result for, I would imagine, being traffic getting better from here? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, David. Yes, so if I was to be U.S. specific, I referenced earlier the YouGov latest poll on brand perceptions. We've made really encouraging progress. And I believe that's because as well as trying to drive the business in the immediate term, we've also made the investments and the commitments around food, food quality, sustainability, the employment proposition, where not only did we move pay for our hourly paid start, but also a far broader enhanced range of benefits, including training and education opportunities for them. And with a brand like McDonald's, everything you do communicates. So the better you move on every single consumer touch point, then the broader halo on the brand starts to improve.","So we're encouraged. We've got plenty of plans to maintain that momentum, but it's nice to see it being recognized by consumers. Part of that comes out of the basics of running better restaurants, and we've maintained a 6% year-on-year improvement in overall customer satisfaction. When I look into the detail there, we've made the progress on the areas that the team had intended to make the progress.","So we spoke in the past about an attention to order accuracy, particularly in the drive-thru. Our accuracy has improved. The quality of the food perception has improved. Friendliness improved, all by the order of about 6%, including speed of services as well. So I believe the day-to-day customer experience also enhances the brand and also just drives that immediate satisfaction.","In terms of going forward, what's important? I'd say a couple of things. I mean, clearly, continuing the journey we are around food and food quality, both investing in the ingredients, the recipes, and the items in the restaurants as well as the perception, better explaining what's in our food, where it comes from. And so that's where The Simpler the Better campaign starts to focus. It chronicles the big meaningful moves we have made and, I believe, signals the direction of travel for us going forward.","And, as I say, I'm not going to disclose anything more about it, but there will be more news to come, which we know is going to be powerful on the customer agenda and very, very strong for the brand as well.","The other element that I'm excited to introduce, that we will be introducing increasingly in the U.S. because we've seen it work elsewhere in our major mature markets, is rolling out the Experience of the Future, which is a fundamentally different experience for the customer. And a lot of that does involve technology as well as the service experience as well. Any of the interactions that customers have with the experience of McDonald's, whether it's coming into the dining area or going through the drive-thru, how can we take out the long value-added processes and just made it a smoother, more enjoyable and easier experience for customers?","So the introduction on of self-order kiosks, the development of our mobile app so you could order in ahead and just check in when you get into the restaurant; it takes out many of those human interactions where complications can arise and just makes it a smoother experience for customers. We are seeing a good pickup in sales as we roll this out across the U.K., Canada, Australia, and early days, but also in Germany as well. So we know we're on to something. We know customers respond well, and certainly it breathes new life into our restaurants and into the brand.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. If you could give us a little bit more insight into how you're looking at the structural margins, especially in the U.S., as you've regained some of your lost footing, what do you think are realistic margin expansion targets? Assuming more modest same-store sales in the flat to up 2% or if you were able to reaccelerate to 2% or greater, how should we really be thinking about it, given the current labor and COGS outlook?","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, thanks, Brett. It's Kevin. You saw in second quarter this year, we were able to actually grow margins 30 basis points in the U.S. with the 1.8% comp sales, which we were certainly pleased about. As you know, long-term margins are a top-line game for us. We need to grow comps in order to maintain and improve margins, but what we were able to do this quarter was effectively manage the restaurant profitability as well. So while commodity costs were more favorable this quarter, our management of what we call controllable costs, both on the food side and the labor side, was better this quarter than prior quarters. And so we're pleased that we're doing a better job of managing running the restaurant, but also managing the profitability of the restaurant.","Going forward, we've always said that we need about a 2% to 3% comp in a normal inflationary environment. That probably hasn't changed much, and there certainly isn't anything structural that would prevent us from getting back to kind of where we were on high margins in the U.S.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from David Tarantino of Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. I wanted to come back, Steve, to the commentary around speed of service. I think you mentioned that that had improved, at least from a perception standpoint, but could you give an update on where you are on that front? And it seems like such an important factor when you think about how much of the business goes through the drive-thru. What are the keys to improving that going forward?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, David. You're absolutely right. I mean, the reality is the customer experience is critical in just our underlying business momentum. Speed of service has predominantly improved, largely because we've got the accuracy element of service far better. So we've enhanced the training, some of the operational procedures through the drive-thru. And you may have heard me talk about a program we called Ask, Ask, Tell, which is a way of really ensuring we both took and then delivered the right order day-in, day-out to our customers. Once you get your accuracy right, then the whole drive-thru lane just operates far smoother.","We also made significant changes to the merchandising in the drive-thru, with more tailored and focused merchandising menu boards, which, again, just made it easier for customers to order and identify the products they want, but also easier for our teams to take and get right.","So I think there's a lot of work that's gone on. The real devil in the detail, down to the font size on the order receipts to make sure our teams who are collecting the orders can gather the right items. But also, there's a lot of work we're doing in the future where we believe we can also enhance service, speed and accuracy and get technology to do some of that heavy lifting for us. So whether it's voice recognition in the drive-thru speaker posts, all the way through to ordering ahead via either the Internet or the app.","Now, we have elements of this going on around the world. I'm not sure we're going to pull them all together here in one market, but we are going to take those learnings and see how the customer responds to some of the capabilities we're introducing. And clearly, if the response is strong, we can bring that in and that will help, again, further enhance speed of service.","I mean, all the way to we have markets where we have curbside collection for our orders. I mean, if you actually order that ahead via the Internet, you can actually just go and on to curbside. And therefore, when you think about it, you've got one satisfied customer who is ordering and collecting and paying exactly how they want. That's also one fewer car going through the drive-thru, so the existing drive-thru lane runs smoother. So we're looking at this from a number of different directions. I'm definitely not underestimating the day-to-day operation improvements the chains have done so far, but also we're looking at innovation in the future to try and keep it smoother and easier for customers, and just easier for our teams to get right.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Wondering how do you benefit, or not, from the Summer Olympics. And is there anything you want us to be aware of in the third quarter relating to that for modeling purposes? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean, for us, there's a brand association with sports. We've been a long-term sponsor of the Olympics. So we have some fun and engaging initiatives going on, particularly in and around Rio and working with our partners down there, Arcos Dorados. I wouldn't say there's anything material that's going to impact our business trends. We'll have some fun with it in certain markets where there's promotional activity, where there's tie-ins and allows consumers to get a little closer to it. And you can expect to see us with a little piece of that across the U.S. as well, but I wouldn't see it materially impacting our business one way or the other. It's just a brand reinforcement that we're committed to, to global sport to supporting participation at local community levels, just like we are with football or soccer around the world with our FIFA partnership.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Given the 3% pricing in the U.S. this quarter, which is at the midpoint of the food away from home inflation outlook, how should we think about your willingness to let price roll off? Steve, you called out the differential between food at home and away from home creating pressure on the top line. And if I can sneak one more in there, Steve, you called it out in your prepared remarks, but there was no mention in the release of the MONOPOLY promotion in April and the Angry Birds promotion in May. So is it fair to categorize June as the strongest month of the quarter for U.S. same-store sales?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I will speak to a couple and Kevin may want to add to that as well. When we look at the average check increases, so kind of the gap between top-line sales and our guest count momentum, I mean, clearly, price is a differentiator, but so is also the product mix, the bundling of items within each purchase. And one thing I would want to say is that when we have offers redeemed through the global mobile app, we see an average check increase. When we see breakfast items bought during the main daypart, we also see an average check increase. So part of it is not just price-driven, it's actually product mix and bundling-driven.","I don't particularly want to talk to the monthly trends, because we've got away from that, so I don't think, honestly, that's very valuable. I guess what I would say across the quarter is there wasn't really a deeply meaningful trend one way or the other. We consistently performed and we consistently outperformed the market. And if I look at the competitive gap week-to-week-to-week, which clearly we do, we had a pretty consistent outperformance right across the 13-week period.","I don't know if, Kevin, you want to add anything to that.","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'll talk about some the pricing stuff you mentioned, Andrew. Related to kind of what rolls off, I guess what I would say is in the second quarter, we had some pricing from the prior year that rolled off and we didn't replace all of that. And you can probably expect similar for the rest of this year, again, partly because of that widening gap between food at home and food away from home inflation. So we're certainly keeping a close eye on both of those metrics because it's really important for us to focus on maintaining and growing guest counts.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry, I'm just coming back on MONOPOLY and Angry Birds result. I think it's really important for a business like ours and a brand like ours to create energy and engagement amongst our customers on multiple fronts. And clearly, standing for everyday value is important, certainly, but also, so is some fun and some engagement. And that's the role that games like MONOPOLY play or meaningful promotions like Angry Birds. It just provides some excitement and some buzz around the brand.","And we do have a, I would say, competitive advantage that we are able to attract many of the best partners in the world because of our size and scale matching theirs. And like a recent example of the work in Japan, so I'm thinking with Pok\u00e9mon Go is a great example, where clearly we're a preferred partner and it's been a fun program. It's doing great things for the business. And customers respond to that, both at a day-to-day level in the restaurants, but actually, they recognize that we're a leadership brand and we attract leadership partners.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just back on the U.S. sales, you're still in an early phase of a turnaround. So one could argue that your gap to the industry should still be widening and it didn't this quarter. I wonder \u2013 just a couple of questions, one is, do you think the change from a Dollar Menu to the bundled value had any adverse impact on transactions and the way people think about the brand? And clearly, as you're very well aware of, the fourth quarter and early 2017 comparisons are more difficult. Do you think just adding to the breakfast all day menu is sufficient to lap those or are there other things you're thinking about that are more profound, you just don't want to talk about today? I think you mentioned something about loyalty. Is this the time that a loyalty program would fit into the marketing plan, for example?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, John. I think on value, is there a trade-off in transactions having moved away from the Dollar Menu? I think there is, yeah, absolutely. We recognize that. That doesn't come as a surprise to us. What we wanted to do is work hard to still have a compelling everyday value proposition in our restaurants. And that can take the form of many things. So we've gone with the McPick 2 platform. And, again, just to step back and remind why we believe this is strong, is because it's grounded in what customers tell us is most important for them, which is choice and flexibility. We're not locking them into a certain price point, nor are we locking them into a certain selection of bundled items.","So we believe that choice and flexibility is right for our customers and gives us flexibility and new news as we return to these programs across a year. Sometimes, they'll be at a national level. If it's not national, it'll be locally reinforced in the marketing windows in between. So we're continuing to learn. We've only been national with McPick 2 for $5 twice now. And again, the local co-ops are being worked on their variations of particularly the McPick 2 for $2 or at a value price point. So we're continuing to learn and evolve that. But is there a transaction trade-off? Yes, there is. We knew that. We planned for that, but we still believe we have an everyday value proposition.","And again, it's not just McPick 2. I mean, there's local promotional activity in the co-ops (45:12) on an ongoing basis, whether it's a $1 drink promotion, for example, all the way through to the offers we're now offering through the global mobile app. We've had 12 million downloads of that. We've got 8 million registered users on the app. And clearly, the offers and the frequency card on there are driving over the (45:33) interaction.","In terms of quarter four, clearly, we know the, if you like, the quarterly cycles we're on. We believe the enhancement to All Day Breakfast will help reinforce the baseline momentum, as does running better restaurants, as does reinforcing value. The team is certainly working on other activities. There is nothing in particular to share today, but I would say that we are playing the long game here.","We're mindful of the quarters, but we're not going to manage it by quarter. We believe we're getting the right fundamental foundations and platforms in place to reinforce the long-term success and profitability of McDonald's. And we have consciously expanded our business plans and our activity away from just a product and price-led program, which we had been somewhat joined to in the past. And we believe that the brand-enhancing long-term perspective, as long as we're winning the short-term market share fight, is a good combination for us.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Joseph Terrence Buckley - BofA Merrill Lynch","Thank you. You mentioned Pok\u00e9mon Go in Japan; just curious if there are opportunities besides Japan for Pok\u00e9mon Go. And then, wanted to ask as you lap last summer's wage increases in the U.S., what do you expect to see in wage inflation in the U.S. kind of in the back half of the year versus what you've seen in the first half of the year?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Joe, I'll take the first one, because I'm more knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon than I am about the detailed financials. I'll let Kevin deal with that one. So our relationship with Niantic really has been driven by our Japanese team. It's a global phenomenon, clearly, and they're working really hard to roll it across a whole bunch of different markets around the world with, again, great success. We'll keep talking to any leadership partners around the world, so nothing else to say, no other speculation to add to it, but we're certainly enjoying what it's doing for our business in Japan at the moment.","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Regarding labor costs, minimum wage, et cetera, you should expect to see kind of not a big bang like you would've seen in 2015 related to one significant effort, if you will, to raise wages at one time. We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country. One of the pluses that we've seen from the efforts that we've taken, as Steve mentioned, both on the wage side as well as the benefit side, is that our crew turnover is down year-over-year. So we've seen some benefits on the labor availability side, if you will, from the actions we've taken. I think it's fair to say labor pressures will likely continue in a lot of countries around the world, including the U.S., but there aren't any specific plans to have a one point in time where we significantly increase.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question's from Jason West of Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, thanks. Just a tactical question and then a bigger-picture question, just on the pricing that you guys quote, the 3% in the U.S., is that net of the discount that you're offering on McPick 2, like say, when it's a 2 for $5 for things like Big Macs or is that just the gross pricing? And then just bigger picture, I guess, as you guys step back and look at the impact that McPick 2 has had on the business and All Day Breakfast, do you get a feeling that there's initial trial there that's difficult to sustain, which is somewhat the way it sounds on the outside a little bit, or are you not really seeing that sort of dynamic playing out as much? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the second one, Jason. So McPick 2 and All Day Breakfast, they have both followed pretty much the curve that we would've expected. I mean, whenever you launch anything and put national support behind it, you have a launch volume. And then you kind of settle into a more ongoing run rate. I've got to say we're pretty happy with how both of those have played out. And they have continued into the out quarters, if you like. From the All Day Breakfast launch in October of 2015, we're now almost lapping that, that time and it's continuing to give us strong incremental sales, strong incremental margin and cash flows and incremental visits as well, and the same with McPick 2. So I think these are now platforms that are just going to continue to work hard for us at that kind of steady-state ongoing level.","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Jason, that 3% is a gross price increase.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question's from Jeff Bernstein of Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Actually, just two follow-ups to what was mentioned earlier, one, Steve, you mentioned the market share gains and it seems like it's stabilized in the U.S. relative to last quarter. I'm just wondering whether you could talk a little bit about the largest international markets; whether you'd say based on whether you're looking at food at home or the informal eating out market, just however you look at it, trying to see whether there's any big winners or losers in your largest international markets.","And then the other follow-up was just for Kevin. You mentioned the return of cash, and I think we're all well versed in the bump in leverage and the big bump in the repo that you've done over the last 12 months. But with this three-year period being close to done, and now as we look out over the next, presumably, three-year period, is there any reason, at least directionally, to assume any meaningful change in that $30 billion, whether up or down? Or maybe what metrics would lead you to make that decision? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jeff. So when we look at market share certainly across our major markets, we look at both IEO, but also then QSR. And depending on your competitive set, they have different merits, depending on which country you're looking at. But if I was to take IEO, we have made strong gains, I would say, across in U.K., Australia, China and Canada. And we feel good about our position within the broader marketplace. Even more encouraging is in the nearing competition, the QSR market share, where we have made some substantial gains in U.K., Australia, China and Canada.","And I think as part of the turnaround, we have really focused on making sure that we win in the most immediate competitive set we are. This is part of the modern, progressive burger company ambition, which is make sure we're strong and dominant in our immediate sector. And then we start to take IEO share as we broaden the experience. I believe the Experience of the Future will have us fight into an increasingly strong position in the broader IEO. In the immediate term, it was getting the basics of the business right so we win QSR market share. And I've shared over a number of these calls and meetings we've had about some of the successes in Australia and Canada, for instance, but the customer experience is noticeably different than it was three to four years ago, both from the designs of the restaurant, the introduction of technology, the substantially enhanced front-of-house hospitality that we now offer, all the way through to providing more options to customize your food by self-order kiosks, for example, in the dining areas. And now we're extending that to table service.","So if a customer was to walk in now versus two, three, four years ago, it would be a noticeably different experience. And I believe that's both winning QSR share and IEO share. And those are the sort of ideas that with the new structure we have, we're looking to move and are moving very, very quickly between markets.","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Jeff, related to your cash return question, as you indicate, obviously, over the last year or so, we've had an adjustment of our capital structure by taking out some more leverage and returning that via share buyback to shareholders. Going forward, we haven't stated any target, but certainly our overall capital allocation philosophy hasn't changed, which means you should expect that over the long-term, we would return all free cash flow to shareholders, that's a combination of dividends and share repurchase, while still maintaining kind of that BBB+ credit rating, which is where we are right now.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","Next question is from Jeff Farmer of Wells Fargo.","Jeff D. Farmer - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. Just a question on your longer-term operating income margin opportunity, so looks like your guidance points to franchise restaurant ownership moving to I think it's almost 95% by the end of 2018. I think you stand at roughly 83% today. You've seen dramatic margin expansion in the past, following some of these aggressive refranchising efforts. Going back and looking at \u2013 the model looks like in 2007 and in 2008, you did see some really, really impressive margin expansion, again, I think after you developmentally licensed and refranchised more than a couple thousand restaurants. So with that precedent, what operating income margin level \u2013 and again, I realize you're not going to give me a specific number or even a tight range, but when you guys move to a 95% franchise mix, how different do you think the operating income margin of McDonald's will look in 2018 as compared to what it looks like today?","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Jeff, it's Kevin. Couple things, one, I believe we expect to be 93% by the end of 2018, with 95% longer-term. So I just want to make sure everyone gets that. As you know, the way it works when we refranchise, we'll pick up franchise margin dollars. Effectively, we're swapping company-operated margin dollars for franchise margin dollars, and certainly then spending less G&A and capital to generate those franchise margin dollars.","So as you state, that was certainly accretive to operating margin back historically when we've done that. We would expect similar \u2013 that we would also be able to improve operating margins going forward, based on the activity. As you indicate, we're certainly not going to throw a number out there, but, generally, one of the main reasons we're doing that is because of the stability of both the cash flows and the operating performance going forward. So we've got a stable revenue stream that we'll collect and a predictable model that allows us to manage the business pretty effectively.","Certainly on a free cash flow basis, you should expect that it would be accretive, because, as I said, we're generating more income, more cash flow, and not spending as much capital.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say just as a broader philosophy on the fundamentals of not just the turnaround plan, but our growth strategy beyond, Jeff, is that with the ownership strategy, this is around us being able to focus our time and our attention and our resource on the areas and the markets that make the largest contribution and also our talent. So we're going to place our talent in the areas that drive growth. We can place our capital in the markets where the returns are stronger and, at the same time, liberate one of the fundamental DNAs at McDonald's, which is to have 100-plus of our 120 markets owned and operated by franchisees and developmental licensees, because they are closer to the customer and closer to their local culture. So we believe we're going to get that balance right, which will certainly enhance our efficiency and effectiveness, not just as an operating business and drive long-term growth, but also our financial returns as well.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","The last question's from John Ivankoe of JPMorgan.","John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. And maybe a little bit of a follow-up or maybe good timing from the previous question, it does look like you guys are choosing developmental licensing, perhaps even over conventional franchising as we kind of read what we read in the press and how you've discussed the business.","So with that being said, there were a few different references to G&A, I think, by both Steve and Kevin in your prepared remarks. Maybe there's some commentary coming on the third quarter. The first G&A cut announced, I think, was $300 million and then it was $200 million. Is your mindset that there could be another type of G&A tranche to come out, perhaps as significant as the first two that you've discussed? And secondly, as we start to focus on free cash flow, especially as we get into 2018, are you prepared to help us think about what the long-term CapEx of a kind of a post-refranchised McDonald's would look like?","Kevin M. Ozan - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, John. Let me talk about the whole deal of developmental licensee versus conventional. So as we talked about last year, we effectively took a restaurant-by-restaurant and market-by-market approach to look at kind of the best way of franchising in our mind. And what you'll see is, and generally in our major significant mature markets, that's the U.S. and International Lead markets, you'll see more of the conventional franchising, which is what we do in the U.S. So you would have seen some more conventional franchising certainly in this quarter and there will likely be further franchising like that.","In countries, certainly in certain parts of Asia and Europe, where either it's a little bit more volatile from an economic and political standpoint and\/or a partner can help us accelerate growth and grow faster than maybe we're willing to put in capital right now, those situations, you will likely see us using that developmental license model that we've used successfully for many years in a lot of the countries.","All of the transactions that we have planned right now were taken into consideration when we came up with that $500 million of G&A reduction. So the $500 million contemplated all of the transactions that we have kind of in our plans at this point. So none of those activities will, in and of themselves, drive further G&A reductions. That doesn't mean that we're not going to continue to look for efficiencies and run the business in a disciplined manner, but you shouldn't expect that because we complete a franchising transaction or anything along those lines that that would trigger automatically a further or additional G&A cut in addition to the $500 million.","Chris Stent - Vice President-Investor Relations","We're near the top of the hour, so I'll turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing comments.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris. And, again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I want to re-emphasize our focus on putting the customer at the center of everything we're doing, from the food we cook to the conveniences we offer, to the service we provide. That mindset ignited our turnaround last year and continues to guide our decision-making. We're moving the right direction, with four quarters of growth, with growth across all four segments in each quarter. But there is more work to do. And that's precisely why we remain committed to executing our turnaround plan through the end of the year.","I'm encouraged by the way we're creating a better McDonald's and excited about the opportunities ahead. And I'm confident we will continue to aggressively take actions to strengthen our business and reassert our leadership position as the modern, progressive burger company in the global IEO industry. Thanks to all of you, and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes McDonald's Corporation investor conference call. You may now disconnect."],"13888":["McDonald\u2019s Corp.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Cieplak, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Cieplak, you may begin.","Mike Cieplak","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us a little earlier this quarter.

Thanks everybody for joining us. It\u2019s great to be with you on my first earnings call as CEO of McDonald\u2019s. Before I go into our highlights for the quarter and full year, I want to talk briefly about some of my observations from my first few months in this role. For the past 3 months, I have been meeting with employees, conducting town halls, reviewing plans with senior functional and market leaders, sharing ideas with franchisees and suppliers, and visiting restaurants and customers. This invaluable time spent with our people, partners and customers reinforced to me the vitality and global alignment we are seeing behind our velocity growth plan. Our people are energized. They are proud of our culture, committed to the promise of our brand and share my confidence in the business and our direction. This time has also reinforced things that make me deeply proud of our system.","We create opportunity for our colleagues across the system. At every McDonald\u2019s gathering, there is a story to tell of the crew person, who is also a grandparent and excited to begin a new chapter in life working for McDonald\u2019s or the company employee who started in the system with a first job in their teens, went to college with the system support and is now in a leadership role. For those who work hard and live our values, McDonald\u2019s can change lives. We provide a community space for our customers. When you enter McDonald\u2019s whether in Brisbane, Berlin or Boston, you are entering more than just a restaurant, you are walking into a vibrant community, a place where people congregate, share stories, enjoy simple, but powerful and delicious moments of happiness with family, friends and loved ones. That commitment to communities is the spirit that inspired the creation of Ronald McDonald House Charities and has held friends and neighbors through hurricanes, tornadoes and countless other times of stress.","Being integrated into communities worldwide, we know the very real challenges our customers face and we show up with solutions. As we have grown, we have recognized our responsibility as one of the world\u2019s leading companies to use our scale to gain traction on some of the globe\u2019s most pressing challenges. It\u2019s the strength of our business over the past 65 years that enables McDonald\u2019s to play this role and a humbling responsibility to lead an organization with the ability to make an impact on the world. Kevin will drill down on our quarterly results.","Before that, I would like to share with you some headlines for the year. In 2019, our system marked a historic milestone, $100 billion in system-wide sales. For the year, we grew global comp sales 5.9%, the highest increase we have seen in over a decade. 2019 was our third consecutive year of global comp guest count growth. To put that in perspective, McDonald\u2019s and our franchise partners now serve nearly 70 million people in over 100 countries every 24 hours and owner\/operator cash flow is at or near all-time highs in most of our largest markets and in the U.S. it\u2019s at an all-time high.","Turning to segment highlights, our International Operated Markets segment, or IOM generated comp sales growth of 6.1% for the year. This was underscored by every market in the segment delivering both comp sales and comp guest count growth. At the same time, our International Developed Licensee segment, or IDL, generated comp sales of 7.2%. Importantly, our three largest IDL markets, China, Japan and Brazil, all posted positive comp sales leading a list that includes nearly all of our IDL markets. We also have strong momentum in the U.S. In fact, we are now seeing the results of our most ambitious turnaround of the U.S. history.","For the full year, comp sales growth grew 5.0%, our best comp since 2006 or 13 years ago. Across the country, we are seeing clear evidence of the power of Bigger, Bolder Vision 2020, which our U.S. adaptation of the Velocity Growth Plan developed in combination with our franchisees. The initiatives we and our franchise partners deployed in 2017 and 2018 putting a new value platform, fresh beef, delivery, EOTF modernization and more, were met with strong approval by our customers. This led to continued strong top line growth over the past 3 years. As one of the architects of our Velocity Growth Plan gives me a great sense of pride to watch 2 million restaurant crew around the world, execute our strategies with such care and conviction.","I continue to have great confidence in our ability to grow and shape our industry and I am equally confident that we have the right leadership in place to meet our customers\u2019 evolving needs with increasing ambition and speed. Joe Erlinger, an 18-year veteran of our company is now Head of our U.S business, where he is responsible for the operations of nearly 14,000 restaurants across the country. Joe returned to the U.S. after several years of increasing responsibility around the world. Most recently, he served as President of our International Operated Markets, where we had oversight for McDonald\u2019s wholly owned markets outside the U.S.","With Joe\u2019s transition, Ian Borden has expanded his role to oversee both our IOM and IDL segments. Ian began his McDonald\u2019s career 25 years ago in our finance department in Canada and has spent 23 of these 25 years in markets outside of North America. In his most recent role as President of our IDL segment, Ian worked with our developmental licensee partners across more than 80 markets. Under his leadership, we will drive greater collaboration across all markets and accelerate our pace of best practice and innovation sharing, building on our rich heritage of learning from each other. It\u2019s an important role for McDonald\u2019s as we maximize the full potential of our three-legged stool of company, franchisee and supplier resources. Both Ian and Joe have deep track records of delivering profitable growth, while building high-performing teams and strengthening collaboration with our franchisee community. Importantly, Ian, Joe and I have also worked closely together as segment presidents over the past few years embodying the trust, respect and unity of mission that are the hallmarks of our partnership culture. I am thrilled to be working with both of them in their new roles.","Now, I will turn it to Kevin to talk about our fourth quarter results. Kevin?","Kevin Ozan","Chris talked about our impressive full year results. So let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. Our strong top line momentum continued in the fourth quarter with global comp sales increasing 5.9%. And as we have seen consistently throughout the year, each of the operating segments contributed meaningfully to our growth. This marks over 4 years of consecutive quarterly global comp sales growth. Our comp sales performance is a significant achievement given a soft global IEO market and on top of strong prior year results.","Our International Operated Segment, which represents over 50% of total revenues and operating income generated comp sales of 6.2% for the quarter with strong performance across the segment. France and the UK drove the segment\u2019s growth, along with positive comp sales in every market and positive guest counts in nearly all markets. France delivered its 11th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth with continued all-time high market share. The quarter benefited from delivery expansion, digital engagement and continued deployment of EOTF. The market has also been successful with the balance of premium and core burger offerings. The UK reported a remarkable 55th consecutive quarter of comp sales growth and continued to gain market share across nearly all dayparts. The quarter benefited from extended breakfast hours, compelling digital offers, successful national LTOs and delivery which has grown to about 10% of sales in the restaurants that offer it.","Turning to the U.S., comp sales increased 5.1% for the quarter with balanced growth across all dayparts. While traffic was negative, the U.S. continues to drive significant average check growth with contributions from both product mix and strategic pricing. Similar to prior quarters in 2019, Experience of the Future contributed to positive comp sales in the fourth quarter. Another 500 EOTF projects were completed during the quarter for a total of about 2,000 projects for the full year. The U.S. now has nearly 10,000 restaurants that have been converted to EOTF or about 70% of the estate. In addition, core favorites, including our fresh beef quarter pounders and world famous French fries continue to resonate with customers and fueled growth for the quarter. Delivery was also a contributor for the quarter as the addition of new delivery partners like DoorDash and GrubHub drove incremental orders and the deployment of Dynamic Yield\u2019s suggestive sell technology in over 11,000 drive-thrus also contributed to the growth in average check. That said, returning to guest count growth in the U.S. remains our top priority. Sluggish industry traffic growth and unit expansion continue to fuel an aggressive battle for market share. In particular, the U.S. is centered on stemming traffic losses at the breakfast daypart by focusing on running better operations, introducing new menu items and offering delicious food at a compelling price point. Finally, in the International Developmental Licensed markets, comp sales were up 6.6% for the quarter with growth across each geographic region. The largest contributors to segment performance were Brazil, China and Japan.","Turning to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share was $1.97 for the quarter, a 1% increase in constant currencies, when excluding impairment charges in the prior year and tax law change benefits in both the current and prior year. Results reflect strong global comp sales and operating growth mostly offset by a higher tax rate versus the prior year. Consolidated franchise margin dollars increased 7% in constant currencies reflecting strong sales performance across all segments as well as expansion in the impact of refranchising. Franchise margin percent declined 60 basis points as franchise revenue growth was more than offset by higher depreciation related to EOTF modernization in the U.S. and the impact of the new lease standard.","Consolidated company-operated margins improved 40 basis points to 17.9% for the quarter, primarily due to strong comp sales growth. IOM segment company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to a healthy 20.1% and U.S. company-operated margins increased 150 basis points to 16.4% as solid sales performance more than offset continued commodity and wage pressures and EOTF related depreciation. Overall, our restaurant margins increased nearly $180 million in constant currencies for the quarter and over $600 million for the full year. And finally, excluding current and prior year special items, operating margin increased 30 basis points to 43.4% for the full year. We also achieved our 3-year target of returning $25 billion to shareholders. This is a significant accomplishment given our substantial investments in Experience of the Future and technology to drive sustainable, profitable growth.","As a perspective, over the last 3 years, we invested about $7 billion in the business to drive growth. We increased our dividends per share by over 30% and paid out $10 billion in dividends and we reduced our shares outstanding about 10% by purchasing $15 billion of treasury stock. This also speaks to the progress we have made in enhancing our free cash flow profile. As a result of refranchising efforts and rightsizing our cost structure over the past several years, we have evolved to a more stable and predictable business model. In 2019, our free cash flow $5.7 billion, up over 35% from the prior year. And free cash flow conversion which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow was 95%, a significant uptick from the prior year.","Going forward, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buyback shares. We expect our free cash flow to continue to grow and we expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","Now, I will turn it back to Chris to talk more about our Velocity Growth Plan and where we are headed in 2020.","Chris Kempczinski","Thanks, Kevin. No word is the power of the Velocity Growth Plan and franchise model come more to life than in our restaurants. In my recent travels to our European markets, I saw this firsthand everywhere I went. I was struck in particular during a visit to a restaurant in France, a society that famously values good food and beverages and inviting atmosphere in the spirit of community. There I saw an engaged owner\/operator who knew her customers by name and had made our modernized restaurant a vibrant gathering place for the community. Kids were everywhere. Much like their counterparts around the world, young adults were busy multitasking between bites of burgers and fries. Parents appear to be appreciating a moment of rest and other adults were seated in singles and pairs, some having a full meal, others just having coffee. With the scene that reinforced the fundamentals of the Velocity Growth Plan by simultaneously pulling the levers of great tasting food with good value convenience and a pleasing customer experience, this owner\/operator and many others across France and other international markets are growing visits.","A similar dynamic is playing out in the UK, where our system is doing a great job meeting customer\u2019s expectations for convenience and speed, while providing differentiated experiences for guests dining in, visiting the drive-thru or ordering through McDelivery. This dynamic is playing out in Italy where customer satisfaction scores are up at drive-thru and dine-in and across all three peak dayparts of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The excitement and energy behind our Velocity Growth Plan is widespread. It\u2019s a result of this commitment that our business is growing and our strategy continues to deliver.","At the same time, there is a realization that we can and will do more to deliver better taste, greater value and enhanced convenience for our customers. This is the guiding philosophy behind our three accelerators: Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery. With Experience of the Future, our strategy is focused on enhancing the customer experience by improving convenience, hospitality and personalization. As Kevin said in the U.S., we completed about 2,000 projects in 2019 and are on track for just about all restaurants to be modernized by the end of 2020. Customers are recognizing the changes we have made for their benefit. Customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. are at an all-time high. In our IOM markets, where the vast majority of our restaurants are now modernized, we have a strong foundation for long-term success by creating greater convenience, comfort and hospitality for our guests.","Meanwhile, our digital journey, another critical accelerator is focused on giving customers simpler, smoother and more personal engagement with McDonald\u2019s by leveraging the most relevant technology. To that end, we have significantly strengthened our digital capabilities in 2020. In markets around the world, for example, a growing community of registered users is redeeming digital-only offers giving our teams more opportunity to understand customer needs and create engaging digital customer experiences.","Throughout the year, we made target investments to accelerate our capabilities. A suggestive sell capability of Dynamic Yield is now deployed in nearly all outdoor digital menu boards across the U.S. and Australia. In both markets, we are using the technology to make smarter recommendations to customers of menu items they are likely to want. There is no question that digital is transforming global retail. Across the system, there is great excitement about the role it will play in transforming McDonald\u2019s by strengthening and deepening relationships with our customers. So, we know there is great potential with digital, but there is also a lot of hard work to do to realize our ambitions. I recently announced the creation of a new digital customer engagement team to accelerate customer-focused digital initiatives, including ordering, personalization, payments, loyalty and delivery platforms. Lucy Brady is leading this team. Lucy has been a driving force behind the evolution of the Velocity Growth Plan and rapid expansion of our McDelivery platform in her most recent role leading corporate strategy and business development. Lucy and her team will be responsible for developing new industry leading digital experiences for our customers and they will partner with our global technology team to build new product roadmaps and technology solutions to fuel growth.","With our third accelerator, we are bringing more customers the McDonald\u2019s they love with the convenience of delivery, today, about two-thirds of our restaurants worldwide nearly 25,000 offer McDelivery. In just 3 years, McDelivery has gone from generating $1 billion in sales for McDonald\u2019s Company and franchise restaurants to over $4 billion in sales this past year. We now have multiple 3PL partners in most major markets including the U.S for the rapid scaling of DoorDash is showing consistent growth and the UK, where we recently announced an agreement to partner with Just Eat. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial and we are doubling down on our efforts to encourage frequency and retention.","As we inject speed, agility and flexibility into our system through the accelerators of Experience of the Future, Digital and Delivery, we continue to focus on the fundamentals of running great restaurants and customers are noticing. Across our largest markets, we have reduced the time it takes a customer to receive their order by an average of 20 seconds. For this change, most markets saw overall customer satisfaction improve in 2019.","Our Velocity Growth Plan provides a solid and sustainable foundation to grow our business in 2020 and beyond. Yet, we know that we must stay in tune with evolving customer needs and adapt to changing market conditions. The uncertainties before us are no surprise to anyone on this call whether due to geopolitical challenges, slow IEO growth, intensifying competition, growing labor costs or continuous technological disruption. The topics we have shared before continue to impact the industry and will need to be overcome. And that means continuing to align around a plan that always puts our customers first, with great tasting food, convenience and value means collaborating with our franchisee community for successful local execution. That means building flexibility into our system for initiatives that accelerate and sustain growth and provide new opportunities for McDonald\u2019s.","To build on that, let me turn it back over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","We head into 2020 from a position of strength. The Velocity Growth Plan has resulted in strong operating performance over the past several years reinforcing confidence in our ability to deliver long-term sustainable results. I want to take a minute to walk through some of our financial expectations for 2020. We anticipate that we will host an Investor Day this year to provide an update on the business and longer term expectations. With our efficient business model in 2020, we expect to continue achieving an operating margin in the mid 40s range which includes the following: higher depreciation expense of about $80 million versus 2019 related to EOTF in the U.S., with the vast majority in franchise margins. With most of our major refranchising effects complete, we expect gains on restaurant sales in 2020 to be roughly half of the amount in 2019 with most of the gains in the second half of the year.","And as we have become more efficient with G&A required to run the business over the last few years, we have invested in areas that are already contributing to business performance and that we believe will continue to accelerate growth, including technology and research and development. As a result, we expect full year 2020 G&A to increase 5% to 7% in constant currencies due to these investments. This includes full year operating costs associated with the 2019 acquisitions of Dynamic Yield and Apprente, R&D spend and costs related to our Biennial Worldwide Convention. We expect G&A percentage increases will be significantly higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year. We also expect our annual tax rate will be 23% to 25%. Finally, based on current exchange rates, we anticipate currency translation will negatively impact EPS by $0.01 to $0.03 in the first quarter and a similar amount for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will change as we move through the year.","Moving on to capital, we ended 2019 with capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in line with our expectations. As we have previously indicated, in 2020, we expect to spend a similar amount. About half of the total capital will be dedicated to the U.S., including the completion of roughly 1,800 EOTF projects. Restaurant development also continues to be an important driver of our growth equation. We plan to open about 1,400 new restaurants this year substantially all in markets outside the U.S. We will spend approximately $800 million of our capital to open about 400 restaurants in our wholly owned markets and our developmental licensees and affiliates will spend their capital for the remaining openings, of which over 450 are planned in China. So, while we expect total capital this year will be similar to 2019, we have shifted about $200 million from reinvestment to new restaurants, which are higher returning investments. As we enter 2020, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.","Now I will turn back to Chris to close.","Chris Kempczinski","We have been on an ambitious journey the last few years from turnaround to transformation. And through it all, we have made a path forward even as the landscape changes. With these changes, customer expectations evolve, placing new demands on the world\u2019s leading brands. We are ready for that challenge, embracing it across our business with the enduring strength and values that make McDonald\u2019s a force for positive social and economic development in every community we serve.","As we enter 2020, we do so from a position of strength of strength and with an unwavering commitment to our Velocity Growth Plan, the accelerators driving it and the incredible people and partners who keep us nimble, agile and open in new innovations and new possibilities. We have some exciting milestones ahead of us in 2020, including Worldwide Convention in April. On a final note, I would like to offer heartfelt thank you to everyone across the McDonald\u2019s system who helped us achieve this milestone of $100 billion in system-wide sales this past year. It\u2019s the sum of many things done right, everyday by every employee, supplier, franchisee and crew member around the world. I am proved of our collective success and grateful for their commitment as we began a new year.","With that, let\u2019s begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Mike Cieplak","Our first question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Chris, I know you and Joe are prioritizing U.S. traffic growth in 2020, but can you help outline your confidence this can be achieved? On the one hand, there\u2019s better alignment with operators at the start of this year versus a year ago, which is aided by the simplification efforts that you guys have put in place. But on the other hand, breakfast competition is set to intensify shortly here, will the same-store sales benefit from Experience of the Future likely to be lower in 2020 versus what you saw in 2019?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. Good morning. Thank you, Andrew. So as Kevin talked about, and as you alluded to, getting the U.S. to positive guest count growth for us is the number 1 priority. I think the things that certainly give me confidence or make me feel better about our ability to do that is, as you mentioned, we have really strong alignment with franchisees at this point, that this needs to be a priority. One of the things that\u2019s, I think, sometimes not fully appreciated about the U.S. owner operator basis, it\u2019s largely a franchise \u2013 or it\u2019s largely a family business in the U.S. Over half of our franchisees are second and third-generation franchisees. And so for them, they completely recognize that no family business survives or thrives by passing on fewer customers from one generation to the next. So that\u2019s an important part of this. And then the second is we have a really good understanding of what it\u2019s going to take for us to drive guest counts to positive in the U.S. It starts with breakfast. Breakfast is the only daypart in the industry that\u2019s seeing traffic growth. We have to win at breakfast. There\u2019s obviously a lot of focus and attention that we\u2019re going to be putting on that in 2020. And then the second is a recognition that on rest-of-day deal or rest-of-day value, that we need to be competitive on that. So I think between alignment with the franchisees, between really, I think, a pretty keen understanding of where we need to focus, I feel good about that, we did see, in Q4, modest sequential improvement on it. But for us, there is certainly not \u2013 it\u2019s too early to call a trend on this. We\u2019ve got to see this happen over four or five quarters. And so it\u2019s going to be something we\u2019re going to be paying attention to and I\u2019m sure you guys will be asking us about it as well. So more to come on that.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Eric Gonzalez with KeyBanc.","Eric Gonzalez","It seems like the industry has become a bit more promotional since the start of the year. Would you agree with that or is that typical for this time of the year? And then has your view changed at all in response to the current competitive environment in recent weeks as your competitor gets closer to rolling out breakfast?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. Thanks, Eric. January is always a highly competitive time of the year. So I think the activity that we\u2019re seeing right now, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as being unusually pronounced. I think, again, this is always something that happened at the beginning of the year. But I think what you\u2019re talking about and what you mentioned is really a recognition that growth in this industry at this point is going to have to come through stealing share. Traffic in the industry is pretty muted. There\u2019s very little traffic growth. In fact, if you\u2019re not growing units, you\u2019ve got a headwind there. So I think that\u2019s one recognition and certainly, you are seeing, I think, just a lot of people really wanting to make sure that they can get the growth that they need to be able to offset some of the cost headwinds. So I think between those two things, it has been a competitive environment, it\u2019s going to continue to be a competitive environment, but I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m seeing an uptick right now.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David Tarantino","My question is on some of the investments you made on the technology side. You made some pretty big bets across the last year or so, and it looks like you\u2019re sort of staffing up to support that technology investment with your G&A spending. So just wondering, one, are there more big investments on the horizon that you see as needed? And then two, have you considered recouping some of those investments or sharing some of the cost of your franchisees through a technology fee or something similar that others have put in place?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. Well, as you noted, we did do two acquisitions last year, we bought Dynamic Yield, which was going to help us with our suggestive sell capability; and we bought Apprente, which is for voice recognition through the drive-thru of that capability. I would say our typical approach is partner not buy. And so both of those, for somewhat different reasons were, I think, unique situations. I don\u2019t foresee that buying tech companies is going to be our approach going forward. But we do want to be nimble enough where there are situations that come up that we will make an acquisition. I think in the case of Dynamic Yield, what we saw there was really an opportunity for us to accelerate our rollout of suggestive sell across most of our major markets there with what we believe to be kind of the leading technology in the industry. And so with the idea of really wanting to drive an acceleration and do it with a leading partner, we made that acquisition of Dynamic Yield. Fast forward, even less than a year later, we\u2019ve got Dynamic Yield in all 10,000-plus U.S. restaurants with a drive-thru. It\u2019s fully rolled out in Australia. And we\u2019re seeing a comp lift, very consistent with what we had modeled when the acquisition was done. Similarly, with Apprente, we\u2019ve got Apprente in test in a handful of U.S. restaurants, and we remain optimistic about that. So I think what you\u2019re seeing really is, for us, just an emphasis on \u2013 we believe digital has the opportunity to really be a huge growth driver for us. When we can partner with people and do it kind of under our traditional model, that\u2019s always our preference. But if there are times that we need to do an acquisition, we\u2019re certainly not going to take that off the table. I think your question about is there a model in terms of how that gets shared with franchisees, I think one benefit is when you get the lift that we are getting with something like Dynamic Yield, we obviously participate through rent and service on that. So I\u2019d say the first part is all of these are meant to drive top line growth, and when we see that, we certainly participate from rent and service. On the ongoing costs, the ongoing costs do get passed through to franchisees as part of our normal tech fee, we kind of separate tech costs between development costs and sort of the ongoing operating costs. We will typically pay for the development costs on our own, and then the ongoing costs are what gets shared through a tech fee arrangement with our franchisees. So that\u2019s been kind of our model for a long period of time. I don\u2019t see that model changing.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from John Glass with Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Just following up on that, in the U.S., Chris, how comfortable are you with the check growth that you\u2019ve experienced in 2019? It\u2019s more than 100% of the comp. Is it possible we would see the same kind of check growth in 2020? Or are you less comfortable given that it may hurt the value proposition for the brand? And if you are willing to share, what is the comp lift that you modeled for Dynamic Yield that you\u2019re experiencing currently?","Chris Kempczinski","Thanks, John. One of the things that I do feel good about with the U.S. is when you look at the check growth that we\u2019ve gotten, it\u2019s really come through a number of different things. There has not been sort of a one-trick pony on that. We\u2019re seeing the majority of that growth is coming through mix as opposed to just kind of straight menu price. But then as you decompose mix, you\u2019ve got a number of factors that are worked there. You\u2019ve got delivery, which is delivering 2x the average check of a regular order. You have Dynamic Yield, which is typically leading to add-ons to an order. You have our self-order kiosk, where we know that people tend to have larger orders when they do self-order kiosk. You\u2019ve seen some of our promotional items like donut sticks, D $1 $2 $3 as a value, which are really driving add-on activity. So I think, for me, I do feel better about how we went after check growth in 2019 because it was heavily mix-driven from that. But there is a pricing element to this. The inflation that we\u2019re seeing out there, particularly on the labor side that does get priced through and so I think as we head into 2020, the conversation we\u2019ve been having with franchisees, which gets back to the opening question, is we\u2019ve just got to make sure that we have balance. We need to have a balance between check growth and we need to get to transaction growth, and that\u2019s what everybody in the U.S. is working toward right now.","Kevin Ozan","And then regarding kind of quantifying the Dynamic Yield lift, we generally don\u2019t quantify specific components of our comp. What I would say is it will be potentially different in different countries. So right now, we\u2019re certainly getting a bigger lift from Dynamic Yield in the U.S. than in Australia. In Australia, they had a rudimentary suggestive sell already in the drive-thru. So as we put a Dynamic Yield, there wasn\u2019t as larger a lift as we\u2019re certainly experiencing in the U.S. But the big positive about Dynamic Yield is our plans would be to take that similar decisioning engine-type logic and be able to use that further in kiosk and global mobile app ultimately, so that we need \u2013 can continue getting further sales lifts in other digital mechanisms also.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Brian Bittner with Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Can you just talk a little bit more about the CapEx strategy moving forward? When we met in December in New York, it sounded like there was somewhat of a pivot happening in how you were thinking about the CapEx strategy even past 2020. I believe you were really starting to see areas you could invest in moving forward that would maybe keep CapEx elevated. Can you just talk about this? And ultimately, what does your steady-state CapEx look like? And what year do you expect that to occur?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. Thanks, Brian. So as we talked about, we always said \u201819 and \u201820 would be similar. So we had $2.4 billion in 2019, we\u2019ll have a relatively similar amount in 2020. And as we\u2019ve indicated, we expect CapEx to come down some in 2021. The one area that we\u2019re currently reviewing and evaluating is our international business and potential unit expansion there. As you know, our international business is very strong, we see very high returns on investments in new restaurants in those markets, and we believe there\u2019s further potential for unit growth in many of those markets. So we\u2019re currently evaluating the opportunity to invest in some of those new units outside the U.S. You\u2019ll see that we have gone up a little bit in our openings in 2020, growing about 1,400 new units that should, between those and the ones we opened in 2019, contribute roughly 1.5 to our sales growth. So that\u2019s the one area we\u2019re currently evaluating. I think as far as longer term, we want to get through this evaluation, then we\u2019ll talk further about that when we have our Investor Day later this year.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Chris O\u2019Cull with Stifel.","Chris O\u2019Cull","My question is about value. It sounds like everyday value will be necessary to improve the systems\u2019 relative market share this year. And I believe franchisees are only required to feature a few items on the D $1 $2 $3 value menu. So how does the company convince franchisees to be more aggressive with everyday value given the cost pressures they\u2019re facing?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. I think it\u2019s not just everyday value that are \u2013 is part of the equation, there\u2019s also what we would call deal value, which is sort of the post on and off type of value. And so I think from our vantage point, it\u2019s probably going to be more of the latter in terms of how do we smartly and in a disciplined way, pulse deal value throughout the year on this, and where are there opportunities for us to do it that, in a way, can drive both traffic and can protect margins. So we\u2019ve been having a lot of conversations on that. As you would imagine, I\u2019m not going to telegraph on this call in terms of how we actually plan to go about it. But I think back to a couple of the earlier points that we\u2019ve talked about here, there is strong alignment with the owner\/operators the U.S. that we need to be in a situation where we\u2019re getting both transaction growth as well as check growth. And so it\u2019s up to us now to deliver on it, but I do think there\u2019s good alignment to it. And it\u2019s probably going to come more through deal than it is necessarily everyday value. I think we\u2019ve got a good everyday value platform embedded already.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","There has been some reports about you guys closing some stores in China. I wonder \u2013 I know you guys don\u2019t give specific guidance for the year, but can you sort of at least help us understand how much exposure the MCD shareholders have to that market, whether that\u2019s in a worldwide revenue or your operating income?","Chris Kempczinski","Sure, yes. Well obviously, the situation in China is fluid and it\u2019s concerning. Right now, as you would expect, our priority is really on our employees, on our customers, doing everything we can to make sure that they are safe and taken care of. And so in that vein, we\u2019ve been working a lot with the local authorities, particularly in the Hubei province. We have closed all restaurants in the Hubei province, which is several hundred restaurants that have been closed. But importantly, we do still have about 3,000 restaurants in the country that are still open. So several hundred closed, but 3,000 that are still open. We\u2019ve also, with the China team, we\u2019ve put in place an epidemic prevention and control task force, which is something we\u2019re doing again in combination with the local authorities there. And it\u2019s everything from using our kitchens to help provide meals to health care workers in hospitals. We\u2019re doing things in terms of giving medical screening for customers who come to some of our restaurants. So it\u2019s really an \"all hands on deck\" effort from that vantage point. China for us is a critical strategic market, but I think it\u2019s probably more because of the potential that we see in that market as opposed to its materiality to the business today. Just to put it in perspective, when you think about China, it does represent about 9% of our global restaurant count, but it\u2019s about 4% to 5% of system-wide sales and it\u2019s only about 3% of op income. And so while, again, China is a critical market for us and we\u2019re very concerned about the situation over there, its actual impact on our business is going to be fairly small, assuming, again, that it stays contained to China.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Senatore","A question and also a follow-up please. So just on the outlook for G&A, I think at the investor event last month, and certainly you reiterated just now, the sort of very case-specific reason to make acquisitions. But I mean, how should we think about tech spend going forward? I think the guidance for G&A this year was a little bit higher than I would have expected. I know some of that is the owner\/operator convention. Maybe you could quantify that? But just from the perspective of should we be thinking about technology as a line item that grows faster going forward, sort of in that mid-single-digit range, more similar to labor than to other investments just trying to anticipate that? And then the clarifying question was you talked about franchisees having record owner\/operator cash flow this year in the U.S. Does that give you any more flexibility in terms of the value that you can address or are franchisees more looking to kind of protect that after having had a couple of years of declining cash flows?","Kevin Ozan","Alright. I\u2019ll talk about the G&A first, and then I\u2019ll let Chris come back and talk about value and the franchisees. Related to G&A, a couple of points, we have talked about how we\u2019ve gotten more efficient with our day-to-day G&A, and we\u2019re investing in technology and R&D, so things like Dynamic Yield and Apprente. And the things we\u2019re investing in are either top line drivers or cost saving potentials. So that\u2019s how we think about kind of some of these specific investments. We have decreased our overall G&A as a percent of sales from around 2.8% in 2016 to 2.2% in 2019. And roughly \u2013 today, roughly more than 10% of that G&A spend is actually depreciation and amortization related to technology spend, so a chunk of that G&A is non-cash as it relates to prior year spend. We do \u2013 as you indicate, we expect full year G&A in 2020 to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency due to those investments. But that\u2019s \u2013 because I\u2019m lapping partial year on some of the acquisitions, we now will have full year in 2020. So that level of increase, we certainly do not expect going forward. But as we\u2019ve talked about for 2020 or as I mentioned in my script, first half of 2020 will be significantly higher growth rates than the second half of 2020. And then I guess, the only other thing I\u2019d say is we\u2019re in the midst of updating all of our analysis and long-term models also with the G&A. But so far, we haven\u2019t seen anything that significantly changes any of our thinking on G&A long term. So we don\u2019t think about it any differently today than I did a couple of years ago. But I do have \u2013 obviously, to your point, we had an increase in \u201819, we have a little larger increase in \u201820. But certainly, we don\u2019t expect that increase to be a run rate increase going forward.","Chris Kempczinski","On the point about or question about franchisee cash flow, it\u2019s exciting when you see the system set a record for franchisee cash flow. And in 2019, in the U.S., they did so in kind of a resounding way. I mean, they blew through the prior cash flow record and surpassed that by probably another $50,000 or something like that. So it\u2019s a really good thing when you have wealthy franchisees who are making a lot of money because it means that their mentality is to be aggressive to invest in the business. Now that can take a number of different forms. That could take investments in the restaurant and some of the capital investments that we\u2019ve been doing, it can take the form of putting more labor in the restaurants and it can take the form of value as you talking about. So to me, it\u2019s more about the point that our U.S. owner\/operators are in a really healthy spot right now. I think that\u2019s also reflected in their sentiment, and they want to keep it going. And so that\u2019s going to require staying aggressive on the business, and I\u2019m confident they\u2019re going to do that.","Kevin Ozan","Sorry, Sara. The one other thing you asked about was convention, and I forgot about that, but convention \u2013 our operator convention that we have every other year is roughly $25 million to $30 million.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeff Bernstein","So the question as we think about the 2020 financial performance, Chris, I know you mentioned you\u2019re starting the year strong from a top line perspective. On the flip side, I guess, you\u2019re talking about maybe some elevated G&A in the short term. So I\u2019m just wondering how you think about that in relation to your thoughts on achieving your long-term algorithm, which is for high single-digit EPS growth, I know you don\u2019t necessarily guide specifically to any one year, but just wondering how you see that potentially playing out, whether this is a year where we could expect some more normalized comparison to long-term growth. And within that, that return of cash that you mentioned, I know you finished your three-year target. I\u2019m just wondering whether, going forward, we should now just think of it as you\u2019re going to return all free cash in any one year versus perhaps giving a target for one or multiple years?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. Thanks, Jeff. Let me hit \u2013 it\u2019s a couple of different things. Let me first talk about 2020. If you do the math, basically, with all of the guidance we\u2019ve given, hopefully you get to similar places where we are, which is we do expect EPS growth for 2020 to meet the high-single-digit target. Certainly, a lower tax rate is helping that growth rate. And as you mentioned, it may not be even growth rates quarter-by-quarter through the year because of some of the individual quarter pressures. But as we look at the full year, we do have an expectation of being within that high-single-digit EPS growth rate target for 2020. Regarding cash return, we\u2019re fortunate to generate a substantial amount of cash flow and be able to fund both the investments that we want to make in the business and still return a significant amount to shareholders. As I mentioned in my remarks, our free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, which was up over 35%. Free cash flow conversion was around 95%. As we had internal discussions and discussed with several of our large shareholders, we decided not to give a specific dollar target over a three-year period for cash return, but there is \u2013 but I do want to reiterate our capital allocation philosophy because there is no change to that. As I mentioned, the priorities remain the same: first, to reinvest in existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business; second, to continue growing our dividend; and third, to buy back shares. We do expect to continue to return all free cash flow to shareholders. And in our modeling, we anticipate net incremental debt of roughly $1 billion each year for the next few years. So that should give you an idea of kind of where the cash return comes out to that. Thanks.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Chris Carril with RBC.","Chris Carril","So with so much attention focused on the morning daypart given the rollout of breakfast by a large competitor, how do you assess the opportunity to strengthen your competitive position in the other dayparts as breakfast becomes more of a focus for the industry?","Chris Kempczinski","Yes. I think as you look at our business and you think about our 2020 plan, when I look at it, there is a good balance. I mean, we certainly have, I think, a pretty strong breakfast plan. We have a combination of menu news at breakfast. We have some service, things that we\u2019re really looking at driving at breakfast. And then certainly, we plan on remaining competitive from a value standpoint in breakfast. But there is a lot of other things that we still have on the calendar. And so if you think about a couple of years ago, we talked about really focusing on food and it was going to be a focus on burger, chicken and coffee. And I think you\u2019re going to see for us, in 2020, that there\u2019s going to be burger news, there\u2019s going to be things that we\u2019re doing there that continue to keep driving our QPC business, which really has been a standout performer for us the last couple of years. Obviously, a lot of discussion about chicken, don\u2019t want to get specifically into timing and what we would do there, but we\u2019re committed to really updating it and competing in an aggressive way in the chicken segment, so you should expect something there. And then we do see opportunities as well around beverages, desserts. So as the year unfolds, I think you\u2019ll see us staying strong on breakfast, but it\u2019s not going to be at the expense of rest of day.","Mike Cieplak","Our next question is from Dennis Geiger with UBS.","Dennis Geiger","Just wondering if you could touch a bit more on operations and throughput and the opportunities there specific to drive-thru times, I think you touched on globally, perhaps how that\u2019s been progressing. So specifically in the U.S., maybe how much of an opportunity that is in 2020, and perhaps what part technology plays in improving the operations and those throughput times.","Chris Kempczinski","Sure. Well, I think in the U.S., I\u2019m really pleased with the performance that the team put up in 2019. As we talked about in our comments, we\u2019re at record customer satisfaction scores in the U.S. driven by operations, and we\u2019re seeing it broad-based across a number of ops metrics that we\u2019re looking at. The team did a really nice job in 2019 speeding up our drive-thrus. We saw good performance there. But I think what we\u2019re also excited about is we think there\u2019s more that we can do there. We think that there\u2019s certainly 20, 30 additional seconds that we want to go try to get in 2020. And it\u2019s a combination of activities. It\u2019s a combination of menu simplification moves. It\u2019s a combination of training and really making sure we have the right focus. We are doing things to bring fun into the restaurant to create kind of that competitive rivalry there. And then technology is a component to that. I\u2019d say right now, in 2020, I don\u2019t see technology necessarily being a huge part of what\u2019s going to be driving cash flow or driving speed of service, rather. We have ZOOM timers, which is an internal thing that we use, that really gives the team a very detailed breakdown of each kind of part of the customer journey as they go through the drive-thrus. We can be very pinpointed on how to drive speed of service. But that\u2019s now deployed in most of our restaurants. So I think in 2020, it\u2019s going to be a lot of blocking and tackling. Longer term, we\u2019re obviously very excited about what technology can do to help with speed of service, which is why we\u2019ve done acquisitions like we did with Apprente. If we\u2019re able to get that commercialized and deployed, that\u2019s certainly going to be something that helps us with the speed of service in the future.","Mike Cieplak","We have time for one more question from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","This is kind of a two-parter. But just in terms of the check, I know I might be beating a dead horse here, but just can you quantify how much of that is spend per customer versus customers per ticket, as we try to think about maybe framing up like 7% check is not actually that much on a per customer basis? And then the other question, I know you just touched on it on chicken and you don\u2019t want to get into timing of new launches, but can you maybe talk about what your competitors are doing that McDonald \u2013 I guess, I would think that there\u2019s nothing that McDonald\u2019s couldn\u2019t replicate that your customers are doing. Is it a space constraint of getting new equipment? Is it getting the right flavors? Or is there something else that you\u2019re focused on in trying to improve the chicken quality.","Kevin Ozan","So I\u2019ll cover the check real quick and then Chris can talk about chicken. A couple of things on check, so roughly right now, 60% of check is mix and 40% is pricing. And that\u2019s been relatively consistent, I\u2019ll say, throughout \u2013 I think we probably said roughly two-third, but it\u2019s in that range really throughout the year for 2019. We are seeing \u2013 in general, we\u2019re seeing a little bit higher customers per ticket. If you think about the way the business is evolving between things like delivery and the kiosks, we generally now have a little bit higher number of customers per ticket. So that is a piece of it. But even knowing that, we have been able to grow guest counts in many of our international markets, so I don\u2019t want to imply that, that would say that we should be able to grow guest counts in the U.S., the dynamics are changing, but we believe we can still grow guest counts even with those change in dynamics.","Chris Kempczinski","And on your chicken question, you\u2019re right, we have a very detailed and intimate understanding of what our competitors are doing there. I think, for us, it\u2019s really all about finding a product that works in our restaurants. And so that has an operations component. Our menu, as you know, is much more broad than some of our competitors. So that\u2019s something we need to be mindful of in terms of how \u2013 what we might do in chicken, what knock-on effect that might have on the rest of menu from a speed of service. And then there are some equipment differences in terms of the equipment that we have in our restaurants versus what some of our competitors would have. What we have been out testing \u2013 we are in a test right now, as you probably know. But we\u2019re testing a number of different approaches in terms of not just what you might do from a product standpoint, but are there things that we might want to do differently from an operations standpoint or are there things we might want to think about differently from an equipment standpoint. So like anything with menu in McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s a little bit of a Rubik\u2019s cube of what\u2019s the customer looking for, what works operationally and then the business fundamentals under that. But I think I feel good about where we\u2019re going to net add on chicken. I think we\u2019re getting close to having something that we\u2019re excited to bring to customers.","Mike Cieplak","Thank you, Chris and Kevin and thank you everyone in joining the call today.

At the request of McDonald's Corporation, this conference is being recorded. Following today's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session for investors.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mike Flores, Investor Relations Officer for McDonald's Corporation. Mr. Flores, you may begin.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me on the call today are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook; and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filings also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.McDonalds.com, as are reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Steve. Steve?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a solid quarter, driven by guest count growth. We grew global comparable sales 6.6% and global guest counts 3%, resulting in strong earnings growth. This demonstrates the progress we are making with our business today. Our strength was broad based, as we grew sales and guest counts in every one of our top nine markets for the first time since 2008.","Here are just a few highlights from around the world to illustrate this momentum. Italy experienced its best quarter guest count since 2010. In April, the UK saw the highest monthly sales volume in its 43 year history. Germany had its strongest quarterly comp sales in nearly 10 years. Canada's sales growth was the highest in the last five years. And in the Netherlands, a market that's becoming a more meaningful part of our overall business, we had our best comp sales and guest counts in more than 20 years.","Our most important priority remains growing guest counts by serving more customers, more often. This is the ultimate measure of our turnaround as we strengthen and grow the business.","We've talked before about the extensive research we conducted that gave us a much greater appreciation for who our customers are and what appeals most to them. Guided by that insight, we're taking purposeful actions to retain customers who visit us today. We've gained lapsed customers and convert casual customers to committed customers.","Our second quarter results demonstrate that customers are responding as we serve hotter, better-tasting food, offer convenience on their terms and provide good value for their money. We'll spend more time today discussing the moves we are making in each of these areas that are driving growth around the world.","First, though, I'll ask Kevin to discuss our second quarter sales performance in more detail.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks. Since Steve outlined the strength of our global top line results, I'll provide a little more texture on how each of our segments contributed to our global performance. In the U.S., comp sales were up 3.9% for the quarter, as we benefited from the recent value and premium offers layered on the menu and operational initiatives over the last couple of years. And while the environment in the U.S. remains very competitive, we're pleased with our comp sales gap for the quarter of positive 3.5% versus our QSR sandwich competitors, a good indication that we're beginning to make headway on regaining customers.","Sales trends in the International Lead markets remained strong, with comp sales up 6.3% for the quarter. The UK continued its momentum, reaching its 45th consecutive quarter of positive comp sales, while Canada and Germany also had strong performance in the quarter. The results delivered by the well-established markets in this segment are a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the McDonald's brand.","In the High Growth segment, comp sales grew 7%, with positive results across the entire segment for the third consecutive quarter. China's continued momentum was the strongest driver in this segment. And the Foundational Markets had the largest percentage sales increase, posting comp sales growth of 13%, led by Japan's double-digit comp sales, along with strong results in each of the segment's geographic regions.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. This reinforces that we are driving strong results around the world from our larger, more established markets to those that are still emerging. As we look at what drove performance, let's start with the food we serve. We're strengthening our existing menu while responding to shifting tastes of our customers.","Premium platforms pioneered in our European markets have become a standard on menus across our entire top markets. This is testament to our ability to share and scale ideas throughout McDonald's. For example, in the U.S., we launched our Signature Crafted line at the national level featuring great-tasting sandwiches with premium toppings like pico guacamole and sweet barbecue bacon. In China, we introduced Chef Crafted burgers made with recipes from a Michelin Star Chef.","The more convenient we make it for our customers to enjoy McDonald's, the more they reward us with their business. Experience of the Future, or EOTF, as we call it, fundamentally changes the way customers interact with our brand. We are providing an experience that is more personal and less stressful, matching our best people with technology platforms like self-order kiosks, digital menu boards and table service. Changes in the layout of our dining rooms and service areas create better customer flow and give us the ability to enhance our McCaf\u00e9 and dessert business.","Poland was our EOTF incubator market. On a recent visit to celebrate the market's 25th anniversary, Kevin and I experienced firsthand the big difference it makes for customers when our restaurants introduce and integrate all Experience of the Future elements at once.","We've talked quite a bit about Canada and their best-in-class Guest Experience Leaders. The market continued to enhance and build on the program with table service. And customer satisfaction scores are up significantly over the past two years.","As we continue to streamline the sharing of good ideas, we've taken what we've learned in places like Poland and Canada to other markets. Italy, for example, converted many of the local restaurants in Milan and Catania to EOTF. It's making a difference for customers and for our business. Comparable sales and guest counts in those Italian cities are above the market averages and in line with the mid-single digit sales lifts that we have seen in other markets that have made progress with EOTF deployment.","Shifting the conversation, we're also giving customers more reasons to visit McDonald's more often with locally-relevant value. In the U.S., we launched a nationwide cold beverage value platform as we head into the summer. Guests came in more often for $1.00 any size beverages and $2.00 McCaf\u00e9 drinks, which included popular smoothies, shakes and blended coffee drinks.","In France, McFirst is an affordable lunch on-the-go that has been popular with our customers. And in Australia, more customers have been visiting McDonald's as a result of our $1.00 Hamburger. This complements some of our bundled value offerings on the menu and makes it more affordable to feed a family.","I'll turn back to Kevin now so he can share insight on how all of the moves we are making are impacting our bottom line.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","In addition to the strong comp sales and guest counts, we've strengthened our operating results as well. Operating income grew by more than $430 million for the quarter, benefiting from last year's results that included impairment and restructuring charges. Even without the charges, our income grew by more than $200 million as a result of strong restaurant operating performance and G&A savings across all segments.","At the same time, flow-through to our bottom line earnings was strong. Excluding the impact of current and prior-year strategic charges, earnings per share were up $0.28 or 21% in constant currencies.","The biggest component of our income is franchise margins, which represent about 75% of total restaurant margin dollars. Our franchise margins are increasingly being driven by a relatively steady and predictable stream of rent and royalties. And in the second quarter, the margins grew to over $2 billion, an 8% constant currency increase. Company-operated margin dollars were relatively flat for the quarter, while the company-operated margin percent increased 160 basis points to 18.7%.","Both the margin percent and dollars reflect the impact of China's strong comp sales as well as the benefit of no depreciation expense for China and Hong Kong in 2017. As I mentioned in the first quarter, we stopped recording depreciation for both markets once they were classified as held for sale. China's benefit to consolidated margin dollars was offset by the impact of refranchising in our U.S. and Foundational Markets.","In the U.S., company-operated margins declined 30 basis points to 16.5%, as positive comp sales were offset by higher labor costs. These higher costs were due to both higher wages and purposeful investments that we've made to ensure that we execute at a high level and provide a great experience for our customers as we deploy mobile order and pay, accelerate the roll-out of Experience of the Future and ready the system for the introduction of fresh quarter pound beef patties next year.","Regarding other pressures, we continue to effectively manage commodity costs. In the U.S., costs for the second quarter were relatively flat versus last year. We still expect our U.S. grocery basket to increase 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year, with more pressure in the second half of the year as we lap meaningful commodity benefits from the second half of last year.","We're also closely monitoring key inflation indices to ensure that we maintain our value proposition while strategically taking price increases. Our second quarter pricing in the U.S. year-over-year was up roughly 1.8%, which was below food away from home inflation of 2.2%. For the International Lead markets, commodity costs were up about 1.5% for the second quarter and our menu prices were also up about 1.5% year-over-year.","Turning to foreign currencies, for the quarter, foreign currency translation hurt our results by $0.03 per share. At current exchange rates, we expect the impact of foreign currency to be positive $0.01 to $0.03 in the third quarter and $0.00 to positive $0.02 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only because rates will change as we move through the year.","Before I turn it back to Steve, I want to provide an update on the China, Hong Kong refranchising transaction. I'm happy to report that we expect to close this important strategic transaction in the coming weeks. With its completion, we'll reach our global refranchising target of about 4,000 restaurants more than a full year ahead of our original targeted time line.","In addition to the China, Hong Kong transaction, we've completed several other important refranchising transactions since November of last year including Singapore, Malaysia, the Nordics and Taiwan.","As I mentioned earlier this year, our key P&L growth rates for 2017 and 2018 will be choppy as a result of this refranchising activity. From an EPS standpoint, we expect limited long-term impact from these transactions, as we plan to use the cash proceeds to repurchase shares. However, due to the nature of the weighted average shares outstanding calculation, we anticipate a negative impact of a few cents per quarter through third quarter 2018.","And while these refranchising transactions will have a dilutive impact on our revenue and operating income in the near term, these transactions are immediately accretive to our free cash flow, as we'll be operating under a less capital intensive model that delivers a more stable and predictable revenue stream. We expect to return to revenue growth and achieve our long-term targets beginning in 2019, as our strategic partners invest and unlock the potential in these markets through unit expansion as well as sales-building initiatives.","Our refranchising strategy has been a key part of transforming McDonald's into a more purposeful, more stable and more efficient organization focused on delivering more growth. Further details on the impact of these refranchising transactions on our future operating results is provided on our website.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Kevin. And this demonstrates that the retain, regain and convert foundations of our Velocity Growth Plan resonate with customers and drove top and bottom line performance for the quarter.","Now, I'd like to talk about the progress we're making with our plan accelerators, digital, delivery and Experience of the Future in our U.S. restaurants. These new platforms for growth build on our foundation and enhance or accelerate everything else we're doing for the customer. They bring the biggest benefit to the most people in the shortest possible time. And we're making great progress with bringing the accelerators to a growing number of restaurants.","Having said that, they are different from, say, our All Day Breakfast launch. This was an extension of our popular Breakfast business and drove an immediate increase in sales. Our velocity accelerators provide new ways for our customers to experience McDonald's. It will take time to build awareness, which is the initial step forward toward changing customer behavior in a way that will be meaningful for our business. We remain confident and know these initiatives increasingly will prove to bear competitive advantages, unlocking growth in our business.","With digital, we see a clear opportunity to provide an even higher level of convenience and personalization for customers on their terms. To do that, our current priority is mobile order and pay. We are on track to make mobile order and pay available in 20,000 restaurants worldwide by the end of 2017, including our 14,000 restaurants in the U.S. As part of a sequence roll out, we brought mobile order and pay to more than 5,000 restaurants around the world. Whilst we're in early days, we're seeing higher average checks and the curbside pickup is a convenience that customers value and thus, enabling us to grow capacity at peak times.","Delivery illustrates our ambition to redefine convenience for our customers. In the U.S., during the month of January, we piloted delivery with a couple dozen restaurants in Miami. The initial tests went well and we've moved quickly to expand. We've now scaled this initiative by launching delivery at more than 4,000 restaurants in markets from the U.S. to Australia. Delivery also shows how McDonald's can leverage our size and scale, as nearly 75% of the population in our top markets are literally within three miles of a McDonald's, giving us an unmatched advantage in bringing great-tasting food to customers quickly.","In each of the markets where we've launched delivery this year, our size and scale has provided an additional advantage. We've been able to partner with the strongest third-party operators, like UberEATS, to pick up food from our restaurants and deliver to our customers. We're encouraged by the results we've seen so far with expansion of delivery. They give us confidence there's meaningful opportunity with the customers we want to regain. And we've only scratched the surface.","In many of our markets around the world, we're seeing average check sizes between 1.5 and 2 times higher than our overall restaurant averages. And in most of our markets, we're utilizing our location advantage and operational efficiencies on customers' orders, getting food from order to doorstep in an average of less than 30 minutes.","With 60% of orders being placed in the evening or late nights, we're seeing an opportunity to serve more customers during some of our slower periods. This expansion of delivery is in addition to the 3,500 restaurants, primarily in Asia and the Middle East, where we've been in the delivery business for over 20 years. So we're now offering delivery in almost 8,000 restaurants, in 47 countries, across six continents.","The progress in our business is also the result of the changes we've made to our organization. We're fit for purpose with the right structure, right talent and right mindset. We have fundamentally transformed our culture. We're behaving like a leadership brand. We have global cross-functional teams collaborating with a sense of urgency to achieve a common goal. And we're applying our learnings on-the-go. And nowhere is that more evident than the work underway on delivery.","We are scaling faster than ever before. Now, as we scale, we're applying learnings from our best performers across all our delivery markets. And tomorrow, we're going to celebrate our progress and have some fun, too, during our Global Delivery Day. There'll be events taking place around the world in select markets for both our customers and our employees. So feel free to join the fun by placing your own delivery order tomorrow.","As you know, the third velocity accelerator is rolling out Experience of the Future in the U.S. Taking advantage of learnings around the world, we're bringing EOTF to customers in the U.S. with greater purpose and pace. The U.S. team devoted a lot of work to building a compelling version of the Velocity Growth Plan, and they call it the bigger, bolder Vision 2020 for their market, while U.S. leaders have worked closely with our Owner\/Operators to share their vision for transforming the experience for McDonald's customers.","In addition to taking them through our Velocity Growth Plan in the West Loop of Chicago, we sent each U.S. Owner\/Operator a letter detailing the company's commitments to them and laying out what commitments we expected in return. While we give the Owner\/Operators until October to commit to the plan, I'm pleased to share with you that more than 85% have already signed on. So getting our Owner\/Operators on board three months ahead of schedule is now allowing us to move even faster to gear up for execution. We're moving ahead toward our 2,500 EOTF restaurants in the U.S. this year and are preparing for a faster pace of deployment for 2018.","We will continue sharing our pace as we redefine the experience for our customers with our velocity accelerators. We have always prided ourselves on continuous improvement and now we're doing it at an even faster pace. That is what makes me most confident about McDonald's. We have strong leadership across our business. We're generating solid momentum. We've only started acting on the Velocity Growth Plan and early results validate that these initiatives are the right ones to accelerate our growth. We committed to pushing even harder and faster moving forward. And with our customers front of mind, that's just what we're doing.","Thanks, everyone. And now, I'll turn it over to Mike to lead the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Thanks, Steve. We'll now open the call for analyst and investor questions. In addition to Steve and Kevin, we also have Lucy Brady, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer, joining us for the remainder of the call. Now, our first question is from David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Just a quick clarification, first, when you do UberEATS today and you're going to be doing mobile order in the future, will those two be linked in some way? In other words, could you initiate a delivery from your app and perhaps tie it in with rewards in the future? And then, just a follow up on your leadership markets, those were very strong. You listed some top-performing countries and some initiatives, but if you could talk a little bit about what perhaps promotional noise or other quarterly noise and what sort of truly sustainable momentum picking up we are seeing in some of these leadership markets. Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Thanks, David. So quickly on the UberEATS and really with all the third-party operators that we have entered into relationships with around the world, they all fully understand that as we develop our app, that customers will be able to route their delivery order through our app onto their third-party platforms. And, thereby, as we develop our digital capabilities, any form of CRM loyalty will come with that. So, yes, we've been mindful of that and very transparent with our partners. And that'll further strengthen the experience for the customers.","For ILM, I wouldn't say there is anything particularly tactical in the quarter that created that performance. What I would say is we're seeing now the ongoing benefit of the EOTF platforms as we continue to roll out across those markets. The UK is going to be approaching, by the end of the year, more than 1,000 restaurants converted. Australia is almost fully converted; Canada substantially as well on their first version of EOTF; and France and Germany working very hard as well to accelerate. What we're beginning to see now, though, is the critical mass of markets beginning to generate that sort of mid-single-digit type uplift over and above the market averages. And I want to put this into the context that we are not seeing any tailwinds, whether it's economic or competitive, in any of those five markets. They're all incredibly competitive. It is a market share fight.","So we're still being very competitive on value. Yes, we want to drive customers in. We don't get a pass on value. We don't ever want to or expect one. So what we're seeing is the more customers we drive into our restaurants or through the drive-thrus, the more they begin to see and appreciate the improvements we've made in the business over the last two to three years.","So I'd say broad-based in confidence, but there are still economic challenges and macro challenges through France and Germany. We're having to battle hard, but we're focusing on market share and continuing to invest in those competitive environments.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Andrew Charles with Cowen.","Andrew Charles - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. I have a two-part question on the UberEATS delivery program in the U.S. You guys ended the quarter with the service available at about 25% of U.S. locations. And I was curious. What are the common traits of stores that are seeing the most success with it? And then secondly, what's the limiting factor to how fast you can add stores to the platform? Is the speed determined by where UberEATS has the penetration or is speed determined by what markets you feel most comfortable adding capabilities? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Do you want to take that one, Lucy?","Lucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.","Sure. I can go ahead and take that. In terms of where we are seeing some of the common characteristics of success, look, we're in the early days. We're digging in. We do see some variability. Stores near college locations tend to do much better than others. I also think we're seeing some things in lower socioeconomic areas, in downtown areas or places where people don't have access to cars, also being a driver of success. But we're really getting in and understanding.","I think overall, one of the things we're pleased with is that we are seeing strong demand from our customers, that, as they become aware of the delivery, they're actually trying and then they're having a great experience, in many cases, better than they expected. And then, we're seeing really good repeat rates. And so the focus for us is about building the awareness among the customers and then the rest will take care of itself.","And then, in terms of how fast we scale, I think that is really dependent on the growth and the demand that we're seeing and then working very closely with UberEATS to understand where they have capability in their markets, and then working together jointly to prioritize where we might go together for expansion above and beyond their existing markets.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","And, Andrew, just to further support that, Lucy's absolutely right. One of the beauties of the broad-based expansion of this is that markets are learning from each other. So they're having fun, on particular, whether it's days of the week or particular event days and how do we maximize the opportunity for people who are maybe at home watching, there could be a big game or a big tournament on TV. And, therefore, delivery plays a much stronger part.","And also, as Lucy says, I know the UK pretty well. And some of the strongest performances are absolutely in some of the slightly tougher parts of town, and particularly late at night and overnight, where people are much more comfortable having food delivered to them than necessarily venturing out. So we continue to learn and that helps guide us as we do our planning, but also at a restaurant level to helping coach and train our Owner\/Operators and our restaurant managers what to expect in sort of volume patterns. So this is a rapid learning environment, and we're enjoying being on the journey.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Sara Senatore with Bernstein.","Sara Harkavy Senatore - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Yes, thank you very much. I did want to also ask about two follow-ups, if I may, Experience of the Future and then also on delivery. So on the delivery piece, is there an opportunity to maybe lower the delivery cost that UberEATS charges the customer? Just because if I think about McDonald's scale, you're probably the only company out there that can compete with the pizza restaurants in terms of speed of service and the cost of the ticket, but maybe the delivery fee is high and potentially a hurdle, so any color you could give us on the economics or whether there's an opportunity to even improve the value proposition further.","And then, I wanted to ask on Experience of the Future, the remodel, in combination with EOTF, gives like, I think, a 6% to 7% comp lift. Can you just give a little bit of color on Experience of the Future alone? I know Steve said that it's a slower ramp potentially than All Day Breakfast, but that's still a healthy lift in my mind. Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Maybe Lucy wants to offer up the UberEATS question. I'll take EOTF when Lucy's done.","Lucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.","Great. So, Sara, to your question on the customer delivery fee, absolutely we're always looking at ways that we can deliver great value to our customers and are testing, together with UberEATS, on different models. In the UK, the delivery fee of \u00a32.50. In the U.S., it's $4.99. And we're really trying to get in and understand the consumer demand elasticity. So we're very much focused on that. And as we learn and understand the customers' willingness to pay, we'll absolutely make sure we're working together to maximize the value for our customers.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","So, Sara, on EOTF, so it's a good question that maybe I could better clarify. The slower ramps-up is when we're introducing a new platform which is changing consumer behavior. So delivery and some of the digital initiatives like mobile order and pay, where consumers have got so used to experiencing McDonald's in a certain way, getting them to change those behaviors takes a little while. With EOTF, though, what we tend to see in that kind of mid-single digit; I wouldn't necessarily say 6% or 7%. Let's just call it mid-single digit. Once the restaurant is transformed \u2013 it may close for 10 days, close for 12 days while the reinvestments and all the elements are being introduced \u2013 we see a pick-up almost immediately. Within that first four to six weeks, we just see customer curiosity, word-of-mouth, local launch events where we create some fun around it because it transforms a restaurant both internally and externally.","So we see EOTF kick in much quicker. And the point I was making about the slower build was really more about these kind of new platforms of growth, which we think have years' worth of growth ahead of them and it will slowly ramp up. Clearly, the more powerful we can start, the better, but the reality is consumers have got used to us, operating with us and experiencing us in a certain way for a fair bit of time and just changing those behaviors just take a minute.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Brett Levy with Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the competitive landscape in the U.S. and also how you're thinking about your layering of initiatives? Obviously, you started to talk a little bit more excitingly about coffee at the Investor Day. Just how should we think about what your next 12 to 18 months should look like between value, core, newness, as well as the EOTF drivers? Thank you.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","So I guess from a competitive landscape, I mean, it's a market share fight. I mean, everyone's working hard to up their game. So I'm certainly not going to comment on any individual competitor, but the fact that we've begun to open up that gap versus these sandwich competitors certainly gives us encouragement that we are certainly regaining those customers that we acknowledged on the 1st of March, that we had lost over a handful of years previous or some of these customer visits, I should say. So our gain will result in pain being felt elsewhere. And others will decide what they disclose on that.","In terms of next steps, I think we've been pretty transparent about our plans, to be honest with you. I mean, clearly, we've got a substantial amount of restaurants that we want to introduce the full Experience of the Future to across the U.S., 14,000 restaurants, which we'll certainly look to by heading into 2020. But also the other initiatives, we're still only a quarter into the estate on delivery. We have only just over \u2013 I say just, but we got that 1,300 restaurants in the U.S. on mobile order and pay, with some interesting learns from the consumer pick-up, but again, we want to drive behaviors that way.","Certainly, when I spoke to the commitment letters, if you like, which was kind of a really bold and brave plan that was co-crafted with our U.S. leadership team and our Operator leaders as well, we now have good visibility into internally, of course, into what our next three years looks like and what's going to underpin those plans. And certainly, one thing that the company is committed to, and our Owner\/Operators is also, is to remain competitive on value throughout that period. So no matter how the landscape changes, whether it's on commodities, whether it's on inflation, whether it's on the economy in general, consumer confidence, we are committing to remain competitive on value as well.","So it is going to be a multi-dimensional growth plan, some just through the core improvements in how we operate our business, the day-to-day operations. And we didn't speak much about it in the prepared comments, but there's still an enormous focus on delivering just great QS&C day-in, day-out. Our Owner\/Operators are committed to it. We analyze deeply the consumer feedback we get from the Voice, which is a kind of a real-time feedback loop we get these days. And we can never underestimate the importance of clean bathrooms, friendly service and serving hot, fresh food.","So we're looking to operate on all levels and excited about the energy we have in our plans, along with the Owner\/Operators, for next three years and beyond.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next question is from David Tarantino with Baird.","David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Steve, you just mentioned a little bit about this, but I was wondering if you could give an update on speed of service, which has been a hallmark of McDonald's. And I think you've taken a step backward on your speed in the last couple years. So just wondering if you could give an update on where you are on that, if there's a big effort to improve the speed of service in the system operationally and then, perhaps, talk about how some of the digital initiatives tie in to the opportunity there.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. Very fair question, David; speed of service, the absolute time, has gone backwards a little bit over the last, well, fair period of time, to be honest. Interestingly, customer satisfaction and the service scores in customer satisfaction have improved. So whilst that doesn't mean we're not mindful of the speed, we obviously need to remind ourselves it's not all about the speed. That said, we want both.","So what you'll see with a lot of the elements that we introduce through the broader Experience of the Future and the digital programs are aimed at smoothing out the congestion points, the pinch points in the McDonald's experience. So everything from if people want to pay through technology, whether it's through the Apple Pay feature or through credit, debit card, that shaves seconds off the payment process. If they want to order in advance, through mobile order and pay or away from the front counter, the self-order kiosk, that again helps the congestion during the peak periods.","And also, just the customer flow, we're very mindful. Again, we don't talk a lot about it on these calls, as we reinvest in the restaurants and the dining areas, we're very mindful that the customer flow from when they enter through the doors, either go to the kiosk, go to the front counter, how that interacts with table service, how can we smooth that whole experience to eliminate, as you say, the pinch points.","So the technology absolutely will underpin our ability to shave seconds, and ultimately tens of seconds, off their service time. But at the moment, the customer is giving us positive feedback on the broader service experience. As I say, we're not satisfied with that. We want the friendliness as well as the speed, so we're working hard at it.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","The next call is from Greg Francfort of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Just one quick one on the incrementality of delivery orders, how incremental are they today? And where are the orders coming from? Are they coming from other quick service restaurants, just the industry more broadly or from food at home occasions?","Lucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, Greg. It's Lucy. I'll take that one. I think the short answer is we believe right now it is highly incremental. Our initial estimates are north of 70%. And in some cases, even more incremental than that, with a lot of the demand, as Steve alluded to earlier in the prepared comments, coming at under-utilized dayparts, with 60% after 4:00 in the evening.","In terms of where we're sourcing the volume from, I would say it's a little bit too early to tell specifically. But what we're starting to hear from customers is that it's really a new occasion that they're coming to McDonald's for. Instead of eating at home or going to other quick service restaurants, they're choosing to come from us. So some of our initial data is that we're tapping into a different use case for delivery, a different demand occasion that we weren't able to access before just through our restaurant and drive-thru business. So we're excited about that potential.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, just to add to that as well, one element, and again, this is somewhat anecdotal, but through the conversations we have with the third-party operators, it does also demonstrate what a great partner we are for them to have, because they're beginning to see a number of the McDonald's orders they fulfill are the customers who've newly downloaded their app. So we are generating traffic to their app, which clearly is great for them, and it also shows incrementality to us. But also, the business benefits them as well. So we've long had an established and strong partnerships, if you like, for our supply chain. It's part of the three-legged stool we speak about, so as well as them bringing value to us with the business that we generate in incrementality, clearly, we are very advantageous to them into introducing new customers to their platforms.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs.","Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Thinking a little bit more into sort of value plans in the U.S., curious if you saw sort of any particular change in comp momentum in the U.S. when you had your national beverage value going versus not going, and sort of any updated timelines on when we might get more news on national value in the U.S., whether that be a more permanent solution or another six or eight week sort of promotion?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Okay. Karen. Well, you saw the comp momentum over the last number of quarters and momentum is starting to build. And I feel encouraged that we're at the level we're at in the U.S. It's a very big business and it's a very competitive business. And we know we had to be more competitive on value. Did we see a particular spike? Well, you can read the comp trends as well as I can. What was great for us, when we look at the regain element on the customer visits we had lost over the previous years, we knew a meaningful amount of those were through the value line, but what's more important isn't just that we're selling $1 drinks and $2 McCaf\u00e9 products.","When we've invested the amount we have and our Owner\/Operator investing the amount they have in the business, whether it's in core recipe improvements, whether it's in the service experience, whether it's in technology, it's great just to have more customers visit your restaurant to actually notice the investments we've made.","So to me, value isn't just what it does to the trading performance, it's also what it does to the broader brand appreciation and getting more people back into our restaurants and seeing the changes we're making, taking notice. And it's no coincidence we launched Signature Crafted at the same time because when customers come in, they take a look at what's on the menu. They're curious, and they want to try it. It looks tasty, and they've enjoyed the premium platform as much as the value platform, but it's always the balance that's important.","In terms of next steps, as I say, we certainly, the U.S. team and our Owner\/Operators, are committing to stay competitive on value. And we certainly know that $1 drinks are working well for the summer. And they'll work on the plans through the back end of the year and into 2018. And when we've got something that we're willing to share, we certainly will do.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Jeff Bernstein with Barclays.","Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Just two related questions on the cost side of things; one, just as it relates to the U.S. restaurant margin, I think consensus was in the 3% comp range with some expansion to margin. Actually, you guys delivered close to a 4% comp, which I think you mentioned included close to two points of price, and yet there was contracting margins. So I know you had mentioned some investments in mobile order and pay and Experience of the Future. I think you even said fresh beef for next year.","I'm just wondering in this environment, what comp you would need to actually neutralize the margin, knowing you have those expenses coming or whether we should just assume that, in the current state, we should expect more pressure. And then my other related question was just on the G&A, because it did come in below our expectation. I was just wondering if you would characterize this as just a lumpy line item type quarter-to-quarter or with the refranchising, I guess, are you seeing greater savings perhaps than you had anticipated? Thank you.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, Jeff. I'll start with U.S. restaurant margins. As I mentioned in the remarks, a chunk of it was on the labor cost side, both in terms of wages and in terms of investments that we've made in order to make sure that we create the right experience related to things like digital, Experience of the Future, getting ready for the introduction of the fresh beef quarter-pound patties in the U.S. So some of those are investments that we're making that won't necessarily be long-term investments, but will be here for some period of time to make sure that we introduce these initiatives in the right way and kind of deploy them the right way in the restaurants.","In comparison to the first quarter, if you will, our comp this quarter, about half of it was average check and about half was guest count growth. And so it was probably a little bit more balanced than first quarter was, which was primarily, or more driven, certainly, by check. If you recall, we actually were negative on guest counts, if you excluded the leap day impact, we're about flat on guest counts. So really all of that first quarter comp was driven by price, if you will, or check, whereas we like the balance certainly of growing guest counts and so you had a little bit more balance this quarter between guest counts and check. And we're certainly focused on margin dollars more than margin percent. And as we're refranchising, the McOpCo margin percent, I don't want to say becomes less meaningful, but is not the biggest focus, I'll say. Having said that, generally with all else being equal, if we didn't have these additional labor investments, we would have grown margin percent this quarter also.","Regarding G&A, it is a little lumpy, I'll say, quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we saw some of the benefit being that we were lapping last year's worldwide convention. So that probably drove a little bit more of the percentage decline, if you will, or some of the percent decline this quarter. But in terms of on our plans for the year, we're pretty much in line with our plans to still have it go down by 7% to 8% in constant currency. So, so far what we've seen first half of the year is pretty much on plan related to the G&A timing.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from Will Slabaugh with Stephens.","Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, guys. I had a question about fresh beef. I wonder if you could talk about that decision to roll out fresh beef on the Quarter Pounder and how realistic it would be to roll out fresh beef across your entire line of burgers, if you were to decide to go that direction in the future.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes. So I think Kevin and I both spoke to this on the last call actually, because we both visited the fresh beef test markets. And there was a genuine test market both in Dallas and in Tulsa. Kevin went to Tulsa. I was in Dallas. And the reality is we really had to very robustly test with the customer whether, effectively, the Quarter Pounder was tastier and juicier using fresh beef. And if that was the case, did it then warrant the operational and supply chain adjustment that come along with it.","So we had a resounding yes from the consumer on this one. So we're now in the transition where we're making the adjustments through the supply chain, because, as you can imagine, our patty suppliers have to adjust both the way they prepare and then store and transport the finished product. So we're working our way through. We will have that supply in place into the second quarter of 2018 and we are feeling pretty excited that the customer is going to respond well to that.","Oh, by the way, it's not just the Quarter Pounder, because we use the Quarter Pounder in the Signature Crafted premium platform as well. So the premium sandwich customers will also benefit from the fresh beef.","As to whether we then extend that to the 10 to 1s, (47:29) time will tell. We look at our operating systems. We look at our capacity and capability to handle the fresh product. And we will see. We would always try and let the customer be our guide, but, at the same time, there's a lot of change that has to be absorbed at a restaurant level right now, which talks to Kevin's previous point about why we are purposefully investing labor and training and capabilities in our restaurants to handle the technology advances, Experience of the Future adjustments, the enhanced hospitality, all the way to fresh beef. So it's a balancing act for us, but the customer will always be our ultimate guide.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Next question is from the Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. Good morning. In your earlier comment about being committed to remaining focused on value and understanding that value can take on a bigger definition, are you talking about more or the same level of promotion? And then, just if you will indulge us, do have an opinion on the Amazon, Whole Foods conversation that's ongoing, maybe just generally speaking to meal kits at home and where you see that playing out? Thanks.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","So, first of all, just to clarify on value, I think probably the best way I could say it is we are committing to remain competitive on value. If I said focus, I think a better word would be competitive. We're going to be competitive on value. We're not obsessed about winning on value. We're not sure if that's the best place to be, because we think we've got a lot more about our experience above and beyond value. But we commit to remaining competitive on value.","With regard to Amazon, Whole Foods, certainly no comment on that particular announcement, but it just demonstrates how disruptive the business world is and how quickly it moves. And we continually challenge ourselves to be our own internal activists. Something I said very early on in my tenure and we've got the culture now running through our leadership teams, both in the markets and here in the headquarters, where we're continually challenging ourselves, knowing that the market's not standing still. And I think delivery is a great example of how we're responding to the rapidly-changing tastes and expectations of consumers.","So it's an interesting world. And it's only going to start moving quicker. Whenever I've have the opportunity to meet fellow CEOs at occasional events, and I think that the one common observation all of us would make is that today is about the slowest the world's ever going to be moving at. It's only going to move quicker tomorrow. So saddle up and enjoy it because it's a frantic pace.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Kevin, you mentioned there's going to be some choppiness due to the sale of the China business in a few weeks in the coming quarters. A couple of questions; one is, is the appropriate time now to talk about what that transaction alone would mean to your operating margins in the business and maybe if it was appropriate to talk about the royalty rate in it? And forgive me if it's already in the website, I couldn't find it. But it would seem to me just based on our modeling, it would get you pretty close or maybe to your target of mid-40% raw operating margins alone, so maybe just correct that if that's a misperception.","And separately on China, have they committed to doing the Experience of the Future? Is that part of that transaction or are they already on that path; maybe where are they are on the Experience of the Future? Thanks.","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","Do you want to take the China? I'll come back or do you want me to go?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","You go with the financial one. I'll come back...","Kevin M. Ozan - McDonald's Corp.","I'll talk about the China, Hong Kong transaction. I'll give you a few headlines. I'm not going to go into all the numbers, because it is posted on the website. If you can't find it, you can call IR afterwards, and they can direct you to exactly where it is. But let me give you a couple of the key headlines from that.","From a revenue perspective, there's about $4 billion \u2013 and this is the combination of all these transactions, the big transactions since November, which is China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Nordics and Taiwan. If you add all of those together, in total, there's about $4 billion of company-operated sales on an annual basis that are now going to be transferred, if you will, to franchise sales that we'll get a royalty on. So that's kind of the revenue side.","At the same time, there's about $2.5 billion of sales that were originally classified as franchise, primarily conventional franchise, where we got a rent and royalty, that are now going to be developmentally licensed, so still within franchise sales, but converting from conventional to DL. So going from receiving rent and royalty to just royalty.","Net-net on all of this, it's a little less than $300 million of operating income, which is a little less than 4% of our total operating income, that we will, I'll say, give up in the near-term. And that translates then into the EPS impact that I talked about in my script.","At the same time, we'll save couple hundred million dollars of capital, so that free cash flow will increase. To your point, operating margin percent will increase. And we believe we'll be well set up, again, beginning in 2019, because in 2018, going up against some of this, you're not apples-to-apples. So 2019 will be the first kind of clean year of comparison, and that's where we set our financial targets beginning for that year.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","And I'll take the EOTF example. Part of the critical element of the partner selection was about that shared vision into the future McDonald's. And speaking on behalf of our partners, they absolutely shared our appetite to transform the McDonald's experience and the brand. So EOTF is proving to be \u2013 the customers are responding really well in China. I'll give you just one anecdotal piece of evidence of that. Where we've introduced it, the self-order kiosks currently have 30% utilization already. So you can see how the Chinese consumer actually embraces the technology and experience.","It goes way beyond just EOTF. So, yes, they're committed to that, but also, they want to accelerate the broader digital players that we had. Yeah, they've got greater ambition than we'd already had established. They want to accelerate the openings. And also, the other growth driver we've spoken to, delivery, is proving to be a very influential part of the comp sales build in China and actually, is a greater part of the comp sales build in China than it is in any other market in the world. So they're actually at the front edge of a number of these trends, and our partners certainly, as I say, have a shared vision with us for that.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Our next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Wells Fargo. Jeff? I think we lost Jeff. We'll take Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. This is Jake (55:10) on for Matt. Just a few quick questions; one, on the digital side, can you provide any color on the overall percent of sales that digital makes up in the U.S.? And then within that, do you have a percent of sales that delivery takes up, or is it still too early to tell on that front? And then a quick follow-up.","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Well, I'll get you to the follow-up pretty quick, because we're not going to disclose either of those, Jake (55:36). First of all, it's early days. And secondly, it would be, at the moment, too commercially-sensitive for us to share that. That wouldn't make sense for us, so happy to take your follow-up. Then, I think we're heading towards the end of the call.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then so lastly, you already provided a lot of color on the digital roll-outs and how that is all coming, but in the future, do you see the pace of these roll-outs kind of ramping up or it will be kind level year-over-year in the near future?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","On digital rollout, well, I think as we've seen with mobile order and pay, the reality is we want to get products into the marketplace where we can learn, improve, learn, improve, learn, improve, because we'll never have the perfect product. Technology doesn't work that way. So you would've seen (56:43) in March to our first restaurants here that were on mobile order and pay. We've now got over 1,300 in the U.S. And we're going to get to 14,000 by the fourth quarter. So you can start to see the ramp-up curve and its importance in those early weeks versus two to three months; getting the learnings, improve the product and then accelerate.","So I think that's typically the sort of ramp-up curve you see in technology, which is get in the marketplace, learn quickly, be agile and then go hard at it. So I think you can see that's why we call them accelerators. These aren't initiatives that would fit into a normal annual planning cycle. That annual planning cycle is important for many elements of our business, but actually these initiatives work on a totally different timescale and we're trying to adjust our thinking and our culture to embrace that as well.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","So we have time for one last question, and that will be Jason West with Credit Suisse.","Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks, guys. Just a couple questions; one, on the roll-out of EOTF, I know that in the U.S., you have a decent number of stores that need to be remodeled more generally. So is the plan to complete all those remodels as well as completing the EOTF or are you going to have situations where you're just kind of rolling in the EOTF elements, even though the underlying remodel hasn't happened?","And then just a quick question on the delivery side, when you have delivery in some of these Asian markets that you've been in for years, can you just talk about what the potential mix is in some of those markets in your historical sort of averages?","Stephen J. Easterbrook - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, Jason, so I'll take EOTF. It's a great question. We want to introduce the Experience of the Future into a remodeled restaurant. So those that need remodeling, the entire work would happen at once. Our learnings from around the world is that has a far greater impact when you relaunch with all elements at once. For the customer, notable change really does give you that kick up in sales. So absolutely it's a fundamental part of the roll-out, be to remodel alongside the EOTF elements.","Lucy Brady - McDonald's Corp.","Yes, and then to your second question on our delivery performance in Asia, what we've seen over time is really sustained growth on that business, with double-digit growth year-on-year off a strong base to the point where a lot of our existing restaurant in China, about 10% of their sales overall are from delivery, with our top-performing restaurants in some cases in the range of 20% to 40% even, so a very strong contributor to the business in Asia.","Michael Allen Flores - McDonald's Corp.","Well, that's a wrap, folks.

At the request of McDonald\u2019s Corporation, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Chris Stent, Vice President of Investor Relations for McDonald\u2019s Corporation. Mr. Stent, you may begin.","Chris Stent","Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. With me on the call are President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Easterbrook and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Ozan. Today\u2019s conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay by webcast.","Before I turn it over to Steve, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K filing also apply to our comments. Both documents are available on www.investor.mcdonalds.com, including reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today\u2019s call with their corresponding GAAP measures.","Additionally, I want to make a comment about our financial outlook for the full year 2017.

An update on our outlook will be provided in conjunction with our investor meeting in March.","And now, I would like to turn it over to Steve.","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I am energized by the position we are in today as a result of the progress we have made the past 2 years. When we launched our turnaround plan in 2015, we said we first need to get the foundation right. We focused on running great restaurants and pushed harder on the basics, including hot fresh food, convenience and value. We will spend today talking about the foundation we showed up last year and upon which we will build as we transition from the revitalization phase of our turnaround to strengthening the business to a sustainable growth.","We are now in a position to prioritize initiatives so we can further accelerate our momentum. 2016 was a year of purposeful change. We dedicated our sales to the actions necessary to get better, stronger McDonald\u2019s. Our objective was to reinforce our foundation and that\u2019s what we did. First, we right-sized our structure, we have been leaner, more efficient, more nimble. We have flattened the organization, so it\u2019s easier to quickly share and scale best practices across like markets and get even closer to our customer. At the same time, we are building a better McDonald\u2019s literally. We recently broke ground on a downtown Chicago office, creating a world class work environment for our staff, and for our franchisees and the restaurant teams who visit Chicago from around the world for training and development.","Second, we put the right talent in place. Our leadership team blends individuals with deep McDonald\u2019s experience who are ready to take on more responsibility with new executives who have valuable experience outside of McDonald\u2019s and bring fresh energy and innovative thinking. We have promoted Chris Kempczinski to President of the U.S. Business and Joe Erlinger to President of High-Growth Markets, where they both hit the ground running. We expanded Doug Goare\u2019s role to focus not only on the International Lead markets, but on restaurant execution, lending field and sense of leadership. We expanded Jim Sappington\u2019s role to include oversight of all areas of the customer experience, including digital. And we brought in Lucy Brady to lead Global Corporate Strategy. Previously, Lucy was a senior partner of BCG, where she had more than 20 years of experience driving consumer sense of growth strategies.","Third, we sharpened our focus. As we have previously shared, we are not managing the business quarter-by-quarter, we are taking a longer term view. We started leaning in, looking forward and fundamentally changing McDonald\u2019s culture. We are moving faster, pushing harder and taking smarter risks. For example, the pace at which we are expanding experience of the future around the world continues to quicker. I recently visited Spain where I was impressed by the way they have started bringing experience of the future to light in restaurants around Madrid. A rapid deployment model we are applying to the city has enabled us to dramatically transform the customer experience in the short period of time. And what\u2019s happening in Spain is guiding our rollout strategy in other markets around the world, including the U.S.","Across the business, we are prioritizing actions that have the most direct impact on customers. That includes implementing All Day Breakfast in Australia, which we brought in the U.S. playbook, and this is a great demonstration the value our new structure brings to business. Introducing dedicated restaurants start as guest experience leaders in Canada, and taking important steps with our food and how it\u2019s prepared in the U.S., for example, removing artificial preservatives from our popular Chicken McNuggets.","We further elevated our commitments on running great restaurants and customers are noticing. During the course of 2016, we have seen customer satisfaction measures improve in most of our major markets, including the U.S. The purposeful changes we are making also resulted in improved financial results. 2016 was our strongest year of global comparable sales since 2011. All quarter marks sixth consecutive quarters of positive global comparable sales which comes after five quarters of global declines. Across the business and around the world, we delivered a solid year.","Global comp sales were up 2.7% for the quarter and 3.8% for the year. Operating income increased 7% for the quarter and 11% for the year in constant currencies. Earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter and 16% for the year in constant currencies. Restaurant cash flows grew worldwide and we continue to see all-time highs in many of our major markets, including the U.S. We expected some uneven performance in 2016 and fourth quarter comparable sales were positive in all segments, except for the U.S., where we anticipated a challenging lap due to our successful All Day Breakfast launch in October of 2015. By the markets such as France, Germany and Russia are also working to overcome challenges of varying degrees.","With that context, let\u2019s turn to quarterly performance highlights in the markets, starting in the U.S. where comparable sales were down 1.3%. The launch of All Day Breakfast 2.0 is reenergizing customers around our breakfast offerings and is living up to our expectations. We are also seeing pockets of success in regions, but have doubled down on affordability while layering McPick offers alongside beverage value. In an effort to extend that momentum nationwide, we kicked off the new year with a national McCaf\u00e9 beverage value promotion, which leverages our scale advantages and further complements local McDonald\u2019s office. Operationally, we are running better restaurants.","Our fourth quarter customer satisfaction scores were up 5% compared to fourth quarter 2015 as our lowest performing quintile of restaurants halved the gap to our top performing quintile. In addition to creating a better customer experience, yet, the significant emphasis we have placed on these underperforming restaurants speaks for the high level of accountability with which we are managing the business. That said, there is more we need to do to reverse guest count trends in the U.S, and we are prepared to hit harder in 2017. Chris and the team have a solid brand that you will hear more about during our March 1 investor meeting.","Let\u2019s now turn to the International Lead segments. We had positive comparable sales of 2.8% for the quarter and 3.4% for the full year, driven primarily by the UK, Australia and Canada. The UK delivered another quarter of strong performance, driven by new food news, a steady focus on core classics and value. In particular, the Great Taste of the World food event featured the introduction of sandwiches, which rotates through the market two weeks at a time. Australia continues its positive momentum despite intensified competition in the marketplace. McCaf\u00e9, All Day Breakfast remain big winners there. Canada is another market with consistently strong performance. It\u2019s focused on hospitality, including the addition of guest experience leaders in the restaurant lobbies earlier in 2016, led to the highest guest satisfaction scores on record for December. At the same time, restaurants have now converted to \u2013 restaurants that have converted to Experience of the Future now bring 800 in 2016 alone, are seeing even stronger financial results than most restaurants that are not yet made the switch.","Whilst the UK, Australia and Canada remain strong, we see more significant opportunity for improvement in Germany and France. In Germany our actions to improve food quality, enhance the customer experience and take a purposeful approach to value in 2016 are all resonating the price conscious German consumer. We still have more runway, particularly regard towards affordability and we will continue to drive harder on that this year. France is seeing initial signs of recovery as the IEO market is returning to a place of stability. For the first time in over 5 years, IEO market traffic was positive. The team in France is capturing some of that traffic growth by continuing to innovate, bringing to life new ways to order, pay and be served. Web ordering, kiosks and table service are now available in the vast majority of restaurants.","Let\u2019s turn to the High Growth segment, where performance was driven by strong results in China. We saw increases in comparable sales in the fourth quarter across all markets, resulting in a positive comp of 4.7% for the segments. For the full year, comparable sales were 2.8%. Notably, China had a strong quarter with comparable sales of 7.9%. We ended the year with solid momentum, due in part to contributions from the core menu and the strong value offerings. At the same time, we found success by continuing to emphasize the convenience we provide to customers through third-party delivery services and dessert kiosks. In the foundational markets, we saw positive comparable sales be 11.1% for the quarter and 10% for the year, with the very strong performance in Japan and certain markets in Latin America throughout 2016, as well as solid results across the segment\u2019s remaining geographic regions. As recent as November, I spent time with the team in Japan to experience firsthand how they are executing the turnaround plan and the ways they balance new food news, value and accessibility supported by the foundation of running great restaurants.","Whilst we have been creating customer notable change in restaurants around the world, we have continued to enhance financial value. We simply be forensic with our finances and we have been. First, we are putting more restaurants and even in tight markets in the hands of local owners. We devoted significant energy to ownership changes in 2016 and those efforts continue this year. Specifically, Malaysia and Singapore are locally owned as of December. Our partners in these markets bring in experience in running great restaurants with 20 years of the development for licensee with nearly 100 restaurants in Saudi Arabia. Both markets will be managed by seasoned McDonald\u2019s executives with local experience. This partnership will create around brand excitement for customers and new opportunities for people as these markets continue to grow and develop. Early this month, we announced a strategic partnership in China and Hong Kong. This structure blends our global brand with partnership bringing deep insight into both markets. Citic and the Carlyle Group have established records of success in the region and share our principles and values. Furthermore, we expect this will be a powerful driver of growth, unlocking financial value in the region and enabling further expansion of the business.","We have now either completed or reached agreement on almost all of our all more significant ownership transactions. Second, we continue to make progress against our G&A target, we right-sized the organization, enabling our market teams to focus even more of their time and energy on actions that directly benefit customers. Kevin will share more of G&A in his remarks. Finally, we fulfilled the commitments to return $30 billion to shareholders over a 3-year period ending 2016. Taken together, these actions to enhance financial value enable us to prioritize critical investments to support our long-term strategy, which we will discuss along with updated long-term financial targets, in greater detail in March. Our focus is on growing guest counts, as we have recognized the ultimate lifestyle of our business. We have done significant work to understand how and where to put energy to continue driving profitable results. And we look forward to sharing that with you in just a few weeks. We are now fit for purpose and better positioned to build on our success. I am confident we are stronger, more capable business today than we were 2 years ago. We have built a strong base and now it\u2019s the time to shift our focus to strengthening and growing the business for the long-term.","That said, we will face challenges, some within our control and others beyond. As I mentioned, we are dealing with varying macroeconomic pressures and general economic volatility in many markets, including Russia and France. In Q1, well, results have included a leap day, favorable weather in many places around the world and a continued benefit from the launch of All Day Breakfast in the U.S. At the same time, I remain very optimistic about our steady progress to be a better McDonald\u2019s as we work to be recognized by customers as the modern progressive burger company. As I think about where we were, how far we have come and our potential, I am convinced we are on the right path to achieve this ambition. 2017 is the year during which we will spend up and lead as we shift to more of a long-term focus.","Thanks everyone. And now I will turn it over to Kevin.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks Steve and good morning, everyone. By staying sharply focused on our customers, we maintained positive global momentum while continuing to make further progress on our journey towards building a better McDonald\u2019s. We are pleased with our financial performance in 2016, which reflects broad based improvements in our operating performance from the top to the bottom line. At the top line, our global comparable sales performance of 3.8% represented our strongest consolidated results since 2011. And every segment was positive for the second consecutive year. Our bottom line performance was equally strong as full year operating income grew $600 million or 11% in constant currencies and earnings per share was up 16% in constant currencies, both of which exceeded our performance goals for the year.","Steve talked about some of the structural and cultural changes we are making. We are also evolving our financial profile, so I will talk about some of the impacts on our P&L as well as progress on our financial initiatives. Let me start with the performance drivers for the quarter. As we evolve to a more heavily franchised organization, growing sales in the associated franchise revenues is critical, as these continue to become an increasingly significant portion of our overall profitability. For fourth quarter, franchise revenues increased 4% in constant currencies, reflecting positive global comparable sales and the impact of expansion and re-franchising. I am encouraged by these results, particularly considering some of the challenging industry trends in comparison against last year\u2019s fourth quarter comparable sales, which were our strongest in more than 3 years.","Franchise margin dollars reached $1.9 billion for the quarter, a 4% increase in constant currencies and contributed over half of our growth in consolidated operating income. Our solid margin performance reflects sales driven improvements, led by results in our major markets. The operating results are a demonstration of the benefits of our re-franchising strategy, which include creating a stable, predictable royalty stream and reducing G&A and capital levels over time. And our refranchising strategy enables us to reduce our asset exposure and enhance our ability to more quickly grow our restaurant base to the market potential. While company-operated margins continue to represent a smaller component of our global operating income, what\u2019s important is that we continue to drive higher restaurant profitability as we optimize our company-operated restaurant portfolio and the ongoing contribution to our bottom line.","For the quarter, company-operated margins improved 170 basis points over the prior year led by China and the U.S. We benefited from a benign commodity environment in 2016, although we continue to experience labor inflation in many markets around the world. Menu pricing is one way to help mitigate some of these cost pressures. We ended 2016 with a 2.8% price increase in the U.S. relatively in line with food-away-from-home inflation of 2.3%. For comparison, the International Lead market averaged price increases of about 2%. We are mindful of the disparity between grocery store inflation and food-away-from-home, so we will continue to carefully balance strategic pricing decisions with our focus on growing guest counts.","Shifting gears now to an update on our financial targets. While we have been focused on customer noticeable change in the restaurants, over the course of the last year, we have also applied rigor and discipline towards meeting our cash return to shareholders, refranchising and G&A targets. As Steve mentioned, 2016 marked the completion of our 3-year $30 billion cash return to shareholders, and nearly one-third of our current market capitalization, this achievement as well as our recent 6% dividend increase, serves as a vote of confidence in our business and the sustainability of our significant cash flows.","In addition to the achievement of our cash return target, I want to provide some perspective on the notable progress we have made around refranchising in G&A. Starting with our global refranchising efforts, from the beginning of 2015, through the announcement of our strategic partnership with Citic and the Carlyle Group earlier this month, we have made significant progress on our refranchising goals. By mid-2017, we expect to have re-franchised over 3,500 restaurants towards our goal of refranchising 4,000 by the end of 2018. The China, Hong Kong transaction, which is expected to close midyear, is the most significant transaction of our refranchising efforts, resulting in the sale of more than 1,750 company-owned stores.","From a strategic standpoint, this transaction puts more of our restaurants under local ownership and blends our global brand with local partners who bring deep knowledge, insights and resources into both markets. We will retain a 20% ownership stake in the business in order to continue supporting and participating in the growth of both China and Hong Kong.","From a financial standpoint, this strategic partnership will enable us to more quickly unlock our growth potential in China as we pursue accelerated expansion and innovation while spending no ongoing capital and limited G&A resources. The new enterprise is slated to open over 1,500 restaurants over the next 5 years, reflecting a much quicker opening pace than the 1,200 new openings achieved in the previous 5 years. With more than 2,400 restaurants today at this pace, China will quickly become the second largest McDonald\u2019s market in the system. With a total enterprise value of around $2 billion, we currently expect cash proceeds of about $1.5 billion.","Following the transaction, our income stream will consist of royalties on 100% of the restaurant sales in China and Hong Kong as well as our 20% share of the enterprise\u2019s earnings. Initially, the net impact of this transaction will be somewhat dilutive to our operating income. However, we expect to return to a similar income level in a few years. For perspective, remember that today, China and Hong Kong represent less than 5% of our consolidated operating income. From an operating margin, financial return and free cash flow perspective, the transaction will be immediately accretive as we will not make ongoing capital investments in these markets. We are currently finalizing our plans for the cash proceeds and will provide an update at our investor meeting in March. In addition to the China, Hong Kong transaction, there are several other smaller transactions, which are in various stages of the refranchising process. We will provide additional information on these and future transactions as appropriate.","We are also committed to be more efficient with our G&A spending. From a qualitative standpoint, the objective of our G&A and capital discipline is to focus our resources and talent where it matters most and customer-facing activities that drive business growth. At the same time, we are evolving to a more efficient, globalized system that better leverages our size and supports rapid testing and scaling of initiatives that address these growth opportunities. We have made meaningful progress towards our goal of reducing our net G&A levels by $500 million by the end of 2018 from our 2015 plan of $2.6 billion.","Our actions over the past 2 years have resulted in realized savings of more than $200 million, exceeding our original expectation of $150 million in savings by the end of 2016. These actions include redesigning our entire organization to eliminate layers and increase spans of control resulting in headcount reductions in both the corporate staff and across our business segments; more centralization of non-customer facing business processes; and executing against our refranchising targets, which will significantly reduce market level G&A spending.","For perspective, our year-end earnings release separates base G&A, which reflects the impact of these actions from incentive-based compensation. This more detailed disclosure provides visibility into the base G&A savings achieved during 2016. Partially offsetting these savings in 2016 was higher incentive-based compensation, reflecting financial performance that exceeded internal targets, which are primarily based on operating income and earnings per share growth.","The improvements in our sales, restaurant profitability and G&A spending resulted in a near-record high operating margin of 31.5% for 2016, up from 28.1% in 2015. So, as we look to the future, we will leverage our recent success and build upon it. We are financially stronger than we were a year ago. We are making steady progress on our financial initiatives and we are seeing better operating results. We are confident that we are on the right path. In March, we look forward to providing more detail about our global strategy, the initiatives we are investing in and how they will enable us to deliver sustained, long-term profitable growth for our system and our shareholders.","Thanks. Now, I will turn it over to Chris to begin our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Chris Stent","Thanks, Kevin. We will now open the call for analyst and investor questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from David Palmer of RBC.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Quick question on the traffic per store, it looks like it\u2019s been down for a few years now. I think it might be down 10% since 2012 when you eased away from that dollar menu at least domestically. Cash flow seems like it\u2019s strong per restaurant though. And in this morning\u2019s release, you said that the company is going to continue to focus on traffic. Could you perhaps elaborate as to why traffic declines can perhaps reverse this year and what that focus will mean? Thanks.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks, David. No, you are actually spot on. It\u2019s not a 1 year trend. It\u2019s been slightly longer. It is something that dominates our conversations. We plan our business. And certainly, the other operators are very mindful of it as well, particularly here in the U.S. actually. This is all about getting the balance right. I mean, the cash flow growth through 2016 was phenomenal for our U.S. owner operators. And frankly, there never has been a better time to be an owner operator in the McDonald\u2019s system than there is right now. And part of the discussions we are having certainly Chris Kempczinski and his leadership team or the owner operator leaderships is how and where do we reinvest that strength in the business back on behalf of the customers. So I guess two things that you will see more of through the course of this year that we believe we saw the guest count trends. One is around the investment and the experience of the future. So that is something that we have had great success in many of our more mature markets around the world, where we are really investing front of house to put more choice controller in the hands of customers where it\u2019s around how they order, what they order, how they serve, how they pay. So that\u2019s something where we have a great track record around the world and we are looking to deploy that aggressively in the U.S.","And then the other piece where we solidify our own value. The McPick menu really does work well for customers, whether it\u2019s the McPick 5 or the McPick the more value end, whether its $2, $2.50, but that alone isn\u2019t winning us the market share fight and the value end. So you will have seen solid this year that we have an aggressive McCaf\u00e9 beverage value offer, which is $1 any size coffee or $2 on the small specialty McCaf\u00e9 beverages. You can expect to see us be more competitive at a value end through the year. I mean, it\u2019s been encouraging in the way that, that has \u2013 that has resonated the customers as we have entered the New Year. And our experience when we analyzed the regions that have been most successful around the U.S. the three or four top performing regions over the last year or two are those that have managed to combine the national value platform with the more local, aggressive for those beverage or food let price offers, value and price offers. So we are lifting that learning and I think all the right we were engaged in right conversations and customers will benefit.","Chris Stent","Next question is Matt DiFrisco from Guggenheim.","Matt DiFrisco","Thank you. My questions with respect to the International Lead markets and the franchise, I mean just looking at that and I know you did a pretty strong comp there of 2.8% positive. I am just curious why that wasn\u2019t maybe providing a little bit more leverage on the franchise side. It looked like that franchise margin came back a little bit. Can you talk about the dynamic or some of the pushes and pulls that might have resulted in the \u2013 little bit more modest margin pressure than you saw in the third quarter, where it expanded modestly?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, Matt, it\u2019s Kevin. Thanks for the question. You know we generally get pretty good leverage from sums on the franchise margin side as more of those costs obviously are fixed certainly than on the company operated side. A couple of things on the franchise margin and specifically in the International Lead markets, a little piece of that is as we reduce some of our refranchising, we are generally selling lower volume restaurants with potentially lower margins. And so in the near-term, it impacts the franchise margin percent a little bit on the International Lead \u2013 on those International Lead markets. And then the other thing that we do see certainly is some of the occupancy costs internationally, specifically some of the leads costs continue to pressure a little bit margins. But the franchise margin certainly more than McOpCo margin is driven by comp sales. They are definitely a top line game. And as long as we can continue to drive positive comp sales, we should be pretty good on those margins being healthy.","Steve Easterbrook","Matt, there is one other thing I would add to that, which is we have \u2013 we talk about a very unique business model and relationship with the way that we have with our owner operators around the 20-year franchise and that the mutual benefits in investing together. We are probably \u2013 2016 was probably a peak year actually for some of the co-investment programs that we have been doing hand in hand with our owner operators in most lead markets, where we will put up some of the support to enable them to accelerate some of these investments. Now we are seeing on the top line, we are seeing on our bottom line, so we know it makes sense. And as the lead markets begin to get towards the end of that cycle on this reinvestment, I think this is a chance to focus our attention here on the U.S. which you can expect to see as well.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brian Bittner of Oppenheimer.","Brian Bittner","Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to follow-up on David Palmer\u2019s question from earlier. These solid cash flow metrics per store had been really good despite the traffic declines you see in the business. And I think the obvious reasons are the average check growth has offset the traffic declines for the comp and then food commodity deflation has helped boost the margins. And so you kind of talked about restoring traffic when you responded to David\u2019s question, but my question is how exactly do you keep the average checkup in 2017 and going forward, given that you like to price more towards food at home, which is deflation and the fact that you are focusing more on value and price offers?","Steve Easterbrook","So Brian, what we have typically seen around \u2013 it\u2019s a very huge question. So I mean if it would seem like an obvious trait. But the reality is what we have seen around the world, the more customers we drive into our restaurants, the greater the top line growth and the greater the cash flow growth. So if that impacts margin percent a little and it may do or actually do the dollar amount or the euro amount or the yen amount on bottom line, both for the company and if the owner\/operator improves. It is a delicate balance, 2016 was a \u2013 there was a lovely cycle from the cash flow with commodities at an all-time low and probably as aggressive as we would be want to be on pricing. I think we are going to bring \u2013 you will see us just bring just carefully bring pricing back more in line with food away from home, which we begin to see now. But the realty is and this is on the new discussion for us in our business. Again, going back to the 20-year franchise agreement, we all know that for the benefit of our owner\/operator businesses over the long-term, you are got to be serving our customers more often. So that\u2019s way we return to. But we know we can grow profitably and cash flow can grow alongside that.","Chris Stent","Next question is from David Tarantino of Robert W. Baird.","David Tarantino","Hi, good morning. Steve, just continuing on the team of asking about the U.S. business, it seems like the hallmark of the McDonald\u2019s system has been built around speed of service and it seems like over the past several years, McDonald\u2019s may have gotten a bit slower, so can you talk about where you are at this system in terms of speed of service and how you are thinking about that as part of your traffic driving program, especially as sort of tie-in experience of the future, which includes some customization elements, so any thoughts there would be helpful?","Steve Easterbrook","Yes. No. Thank you. Thanks David. Speed of service has declined slightly, it\u2019s handful of seconds slower by the end of \u201816 and we were by the end of \u201815. So I guess there is a number of things we are trying to do. You will hear me talk about or heard me referring the thoughts around net simplification where if we are going to introduce new menu items, new ideas, we got to reduce the complexity by at least, if not more than the same amount. So our operations teams, particularly in the U.S. are deeply focused on that and just simplification isn\u2019t just on the menu, it could be on different operational processes. It could be the use of technology stated on the manual work out of the way, simplifying just the merchandising all the way through training programs in the restaurants and making them more efficient and more effective. So there is a number of different pillars to our simplification efforts. With regard to Experience of the Future, I think this absolutely addresses the speed of service issue in a way that consumers are in control of. So if you wanted to \u2013 maybe you enter a restaurant, you are with your family and you want to spend a little more time ordering at the self order kiosks and you want accustom, you can dwell for as long as you want, placing your order, getting it right, enjoying the moment together. And then a plenty of time together just be able to go and sit at the table and we will bring it out to you. If you are wanting that from counter speed of service in a traditional way, effectively I would see that speeding up, because effectively, some of the larger orders will not be there at the front counter and they will just be the more grab and go type customers. So \u2013 and simply on the drive through, we \u2013 as we develop and continue to invest in technology and we get our order ahead and our order and pay capabilities through the app, better defined by through the course of this year. Then a lot of the elements of the McDonald\u2019s experience that can slow it down, not just for you, but maybe the customer behind you in the line are taken out of it. So, we believe we can have technology to a lot of that heavy lifting and any of the experience be better and the service charge will improve as a result.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Nicole Miller Regan of Piper Jaffray.","Nicole Miller Regan","Thanks. Good morning. In the U.S, when you think about grocery store deflation, if it were to lessen, do you expect to have more guests that were eating at home or turn that would account for increases in guest traffic or would you expect to have more pricing power to use with the current guests you have? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Hey, Nicole. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do expect kind of the food at home, I\u2019ll call it deflation to ease or not be as favorable as it was in 2016. The IEO industry is still projected to be relatively muted in 2017. But I think what it does is, as you know, we look at various factors when we look at pricing. We will look at food-away-from-home inflation and food-at-home inflation and competitors to determine the right kind of approach to our pricing. I think it gives us an opportunity to potentially gain some customers back that are right now eating at home. Again, as Steve mentioned early, we do have to be careful on the pricing side with balancing price increases with continuing to grow guest counts. And so we will take a close look to make sure that we don\u2019t get too far ahead on our pricing at the expense of guest counts. But certainly, if grocery store prices continue to rise or our guests favorable in 2016, we view that as a positive for some of our traffic.","Steve Easterbrook","Nicole, it\u2019s just a different perspective on the same question actually. It\u2019s typically clearly we have always been part of the food-away-from-home market. You may have noticed, we have been curious here as to whether there is an opportunity for us to serve the food at home market as well. So, we have initiated very, very early stages to small pilot test down in Florida to see whether home delivery could be something that helps to address consumer demands both at home as well as us making their demand when they are away from home. So, that doesn\u2019t necessarily obviously your pricing equation, but it\u2019s \u2013 we are curious as to whether the demand is there for food-at-home is something that we could also play a part in.","Chris Stent","Next question is from John Glass of Morgan Stanley.","John Glass","Thanks very much. I had a question about the SG&A. First just a specific what is your sense of timing of when you are going to get the full 500 changed? I think initially you said most of it in \u201817 maybe the refranchising has changed that a little bit and then so \u201817 versus \u201818 quantity? And then, secondly, is it right to think that $2.1 billion is the right number or is there going to be some reinvestment in the business or growth in SG&A over time. It sounded like Steve, from your language in the release, that we are redirecting some capital in G&A spending towards strategic initiatives. So, I am wondering if you are shifting a little more to putting more money back into the business and therefore the $2.1 billion is the right anchor point for G&A in \u201818.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, John. Couple of pieces of that question. One, I would say we are on track certainly with our original plan through 2016, if not potentially a little bit ahead from a timing perspective. We will give a little more update at the investor meeting in March as far as kind of how we think about G&A through 2018 as well as going forward. The one other piece I would say is when we gave that target and we have not changed on this is it\u2019s a net savings target meaning that it contemplates a reinvestment within it. So we are not going to say that we are saving money and then reinvesting it all so that you don\u2019t see kind of a net reduction in G&A. You should expect to see a net reduction in G&A that also incorporates what we need to invest in the business in order to grow.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, John, just to tag on any comments you heard me say previously, I am firmly of the belief that we do have sufficient resource given the targets that Kevin outlined. Part of the culture that we are embracing here is to create a higher \u2013 a heightened level of competition for those resources. If you have a limited fall of capital and that limited fall of G&A, only the best and biggest ideas get funded, so whether that\u2019s the market level or corporate level. And I was on the receiving end of that when I was a Managing Director back in the UK and you had to fight for your capital. You had to demonstrate you could deliver better returns than the person in the market next to you, not in antagonistic way, but it was a performance-based environment. And as we have heightened accountability across our business, that\u2019s part of it. So I think we don\u2019t see those numbers going back up again. I think there is sufficient resource for us to deliver the great growth that we are filing.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Andrew Charles of Cowen.","Andrew Charles","Great, thank you. In the second quarter you made some nice drive in the refranchising initiatives, but your gains were little light relative to the average in the first three quarters of 2015. So I was wondering can you speak out to the geographic mix of stores you are franchised whether it\u2019s proceeds through store in 4Q relative to what you did in the first 9 months of the year? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Yes, Andrew. So, the refranchising is impacted by a couple of things. One, it depends on where we are refranchising obviously, but it also depends on whether we are refranchising individual stores or potentially what I will entire markets kind of the developmental licensee. What you will have seen in 2015 and for a large piece of 2016 is that a lot of the refranchising would be in our markets, in the foundation segment, as well as a little bit in the high growth segment. And a couple of the markets in the International Lead segment, where we are doing more of our conventional franchising, it does get impacted by the mix of stores within every country as well as how far along each country is in their franchising journey, if you will. So, some that have more ways to go, let\u2019s say, may get higher proceeds at the beginning as they are selling some higher volume stores. As they get near the end of their refranchising, they are now selling generally lower volume restaurants and then wouldn\u2019t have the same level of proceeds. So no, you can see relatively swing \u2013 relative swings from quarter-to-quarter or from year-to-year depending on the mix of which countries are actually selling the restaurants.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Greg Francfort of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Greg Francfort","Hey, guys. Can you talk a little bit about remodeling, particularly in the U.S. where you stand the kind of returns you are seeing on the remodeled stores and I guess how you view it? Do you view part of the investment is made into capital, some of it as growth capital. I guess, how do you look at that sort of cost and return framework?","Kevin Ozan","Yes, thanks, Greg. Right now, we are little over halfway through the restaurants are being modernized in the U.S. As you know, we are certainly much farther along in most of the international countries, where we are certainly more modernized and are just now investing in the experience of the future aspects of it. In the U.S, a lot of our restaurants need to have both the experience of the future elements as well as the remodeling perspective. In general, in the U.S., we have seen kind of 5% to 6% sales bumps as we remodel a restaurant or bring it up to modernize standards. That\u2019s relatively consistent around the world. It ranges a little bit. But I would say kind of the 5% to 6% sales above market is a pretty good threshold that we use. And the U.S, you will hear some more plans as we get into our March 1 investor event, but we are planning to continue to modernize the U.S. state over the next few years.","Steve Easterbrook","And Greg, just to add to that, I mean, Kevin is absolutely right. Maintenance spend is largely the responsibility of the owner-operator. So, we will have maintenance spend in our small full of McOpCo restaurants. So fundamentally, our capital investment and our co-investment is on growth initiatives, whether that\u2019s \u2013 and that will be customer facing either it gives us a chance to enhance the menu or enhance the experience. So, we are very much growth focused in how we invest directly or co-invest our capital dollars?","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jeremy Scott of CLSA.","Jeremy Scott","Good morning. Just want to talk a little bit about the store consolidation in the U.S. First, how many stores would you estimate are expected to come off the system over the next 3 to 5 years? And then just from the context of the guest count discussion, into what extent is McDonald\u2019s exposure to weakening retail trade zones impacting traffic? Is there a new equilibrium point for store penetration in the U.S.?","Steve Easterbrook","So, the eating out market, Germany is huge. And we see IEO as modest, very modest growth potential, but a gentle growth potential over the next handful of years. So that push you into a market share and without still having a relatively small percentage of that overall and formal eating out market, there is plenty of customers out there eating out. We just need to fight harder and make sure that we earn the right models to turn our way. So I believe there is guest count growth potential there if we do the right things. With regard to the new restaurants, I don\u2019t know if Kevin has anymore details, but we are typically a net growth company. We have had about 1 or 2 years over the last decade where we have looked to address the portfolio that we have chosen to take a particular project and just deal with the title, the locations, which are no longer appropriate for us. But I don\u2019t see that they have contraction frankly.","Kevin Ozan","Globally, certainly, you would see several, probably net near the 1,000 restaurants that we have been on track. I will say in the U.S, you wouldn\u2019t see a lot of growth over the next couple of years as we will probably focus most of our investment dollars on the experience of the future and remodeling as we talked about.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Brett Levy of Deutsche Bank.","Brett Levy","Good morning. Can you provide for us a little bit more updates on the technology front specifically what you are expecting out of the U.S. as you expand out your mobile and your mobile ordering? And also if there is any reference points you can give us from either Scandinavia, Australia or France that provides any background for what kind of sales lifts or returns you are expecting and how are you quantifying what\u2019s the success on it? Thank you.","Steve Easterbrook","Yes, thanks, Greg. Well, I mean, the quantification is satisfied customers and growth in sales and transactions. So I mean we have got absolutely hard measure expectations, because we are investing significantly in technology as our owner operators. Just to give you some texture here in the U.S, for example, where we have launched the global mobile app launch here in the U.S., we have now had 18 million downloads. We have had over 11 million of those are registered users. And the month of December 2016 saw the greatest contribution to sales by the app that we have seen yet and that has been growing month by month by month. It\u2019s still \u2013 it\u2019s noticeable now, but not material. So clearly, our ambition is to make that a material number. Elsewhere around the world, we are testing different elements through technology that we can then put together. So for example, order ahead \u2013 order and pay, for example, whether it\u2019s through the internet or through the app, we are testing that. We are testing curbside check-in where if you pull on to the parking lot, you can actually pull up into a dedicated bay where you can just scan your order, we can bring it out to you. Plus also, a lot of the in-restaurant technology, maximizing the consumer benefit of the self-order kiosks. Again, you can just check your pre-order and just scan it at kiosk and sit straight down and get your table service and also to help support and that is around the whole area of CR loyalty where we have a huge opportunity. Again, acknowledging there are others who are further ahead than us, but this is one where you got to get it right. It\u2019s better to be right than to be first to market. And so we are investing a lot of time and effort to best understand what resonates most with customers in terms of appreciating that business and encouraging them more often. But ultimately, at the moment, we are focusing on the experience side, order, pay, curbside check-in, and just making that experience smoother, easier, more convenient and then we\u2019ll start building reward mechanisms into that over time.","Chris Stent","Next question is from Jason West of Credit Suisse.","Jason West","Yes, thanks. Just one quick follow-up and then a question, on the G&A targets, Kevin, I just wanted to confirm if that includes or excludes the movement in incentive comp that we have seen since you originally gave those targets. And then a bigger picture question on the March 1 meeting, if you guys, I don\u2019t know if you want to give details. But just what\u2019s the kind of purpose of this meeting? Is it just to lay out the \u201817 guidance or is there more in terms of longer term targets and things like that, that you are going to be discussing at that meeting? Thanks.","Kevin Ozan","Thanks, Jason. Let me start with the G&A. Just to give perspective, the \u2013 as most companies do, total incentive comp is higher and lower in any given year depending on the company performance. So you will see in our earnings release, we split out incentive comp, so you can see that phenomenon, if you will. And you will see that in 2015, we incurred a little over $300 million of incentive comp. That was at below targeted performance for us. In 2016, you will see that we have a little over $400 million of incentive comp and that was significantly above target performance for us. So certainly, depending on our performance in a year and that\u2019s generally operating income growth and EPS growth. That line could swing from 1 year to the next. Having said that, a couple of points I want to make, one is, going into 2017 and as you would imagine, we reset that number to 100% as we go into plan every year, not knowing where we will end up obviously. As we go into to 2017, so I mentioned that in 2015, we had over $300 million, and that was at a below target performance. Going into 2017, our plan at 100%, total incentive comp will be less than $300 million. So we are saving some incentive comp on our base plan because we have less people obviously. Second, the other thing I just want to make sure that everyone is focused on is, our focus is really on growing operating margin. And that you know while we are focused on saving G&A and making sure we are efficient, I am not 100% certain that everyone in the industry classifies all the costs exactly in the same line item within a P&L. And so we are focused on operating margin because that\u2019s kind of the bottom line of how efficient are you at bringing your total revenues down at the bottom line. So just wanted to make those a few points related to the G&A. And then the operating margin as I mentioned, we grew that substantially in 2016 from 28.1% to 31.5%. Related to the March 1, Investor Event, there will be a few components of it. One, we will talk about 2017 guidance. As Chris mentioned, we normally have an outlook section that gives you 2017 guidance in there. We didn\u2019t have that in there this time, because we thought we could give you half the sorry without all the context. So it would be easier to do this all at once on March 1. And so part of what it will be 2017 outlook if you will. But it also be talking about our longer term strategies and long-term financial targets and how we expect to get there. And so that\u2019s where a chunk of the time will be spent on March 1 at that Investor Event.","Steve Easterbrook","Hey Jason, just add to that, we are confident and we are excited about where we got the business to over the last 2 years. And we are certainly quite excited about the plans we have had, I mean just to be clear, we are planning growth and like-for-like growth in every major market around the world in 2017 and beyond. And we want to share they are the find the best way that we can share that excitement and build the credibility and the confidence in \u2013 that you can match our confidence and excitement. So rather just listen to the plan, we thought it would be fun to have you to actually experience the plan. So this will be surely some content, some meaningful content on the table, so this will be an experiential day for you as well. So we can take people through some of the components that we believe are customer driven will drive that guest count growth we talk about drive business growth, drive profitability. But it will be a varied and fun day and something \u2013 somewhat unique I think in Investor Day, so I am looking forward to that a lot.","Chris Stent","Okay. We are near the top of the hour. So I will turn it over to Steve, who has a few closing comments.","Steve Easterbrook","Thank you, Chris. And given that this is Chris\u2019 last earnings call with McDonald\u2019s, I would like to take a moment to personally acknowledge Chris and the significant role he has played, not only building and leading a first class IR team, but also the trust advisor to Kevin and me. On behalf of everyone at McDonald\u2019s, we bring these words and culture over the years, Chris, thank you very much. We wish you all the best on your new endeavors.","And again, thanks to everyone else for joining us this morning. So in closing, I want to reemphasize how encouraged I am by the progress we have made. 2016 was a year of purposeful change. We have built the foundation that\u2019s enabling us to transition from turnaround to longer term growth. We remain focused on the basics of running great restaurants, at the same time, driving operating growth, building brand excitement and enhancing financial value. As a result, we are now in a position to prioritize initiatives will further strengthen our business. We look forward to talking more about our plans in March. As we step up and lead in 2017, I am energized about the opportunities ahead and eager to continue our journey to assert McDonald\u2019s as the global leader of the IEO industry. Thanks to all of you. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes McDonald\u2019s Corporation investor conference call. Thank you. Have a great day."]}}
