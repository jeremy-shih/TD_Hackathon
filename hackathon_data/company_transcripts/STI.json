Welcome to the SunTrust Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Our conference is being recorded, and if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Jill. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that cover the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website. With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and CEO; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website at www.suntrust.com.","Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William Henry Rogers","Thanks, Ankur. So I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter before turning the call over to Aleem for more details on our results. I'll then wrap up with a review of our segment performance and a 2013 total year recap.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.77 on net income of $413 million. Excluding the significant items that impacted the third quarter, earnings per share grew 16% on a sequential quarter basis. We generated modest revenue growth as net interest income increased slightly from the prior quarter due to loan growth and adjusted noninterest income improved in part due to increases in mortgage servicing and trading income.","Expenses increased $53 million sequentially after adjusting for the significant third quarter items. This was primarily the result of higher employee compensation and benefits expense due to an abnormally low third quarter in which we explicitly reduced incentive compensation. In the fourth quarter, it was accrued at a more normal level. Operating losses on an adjusted basis were also higher this quarter over last. Expenses, however, were down 9% from the fourth quarter of last year as a result of our continued expense management focus, coupled with declines in cyclical costs.","Average performing loans continued on a positive trend, increasing $3.1 billion to 3% over last quarter with growth across several loan portfolios. And average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter with the continuation of the favorable mix shift. Credit quality continued to improve with nonperforming loans and net charge-offs hitting new 6-year lows. Nonperforming loans declined 6% from last quarter and 37% from last year. And this quarter's net charge-off ratio improved to 40 basis points. Lastly, our capital position remained solid with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel I basis and 9.6% on a Basel III basis.","So now let me turn it over to Aleem for more details.","Aleem Gillani","Thank you, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter call. Before I begin my review of this quarter, let me remind you that our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.33 due to the closure of several legacy mortgage and related matters. In addition, our third quarter of 2012 EPS was positively impacted by $1.40 due to the actions we announced in September of that year. Both of these actions skew sequential quarter and annual comparisons. Therefore, I will focus on core trends where applicable.","As Bill said, earnings per share this quarter was $0.77, which was $0.16 -- 16% higher than adjusted EPS in the previous quarter and 18% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012. The sequential quarter increase was due to increased revenue and a beneficial effective tax rate, which more than offset higher adjusted noninterest expense.","The effective tax rate this quarter was caused by certain discrete year-end items. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, earnings improved due to lower loan-loss provision and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower mortgage production income and net interest income. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $2.74. This growth was driven by lower loan-loss provision and lower noninterest expense, which more than offset declines in mortgage-related revenues and net interest income. We'll review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5.","Net interest income and the net interest margin were generally stable relative to the prior quarter. The net interest margin improved 1 basis point as higher securities yields and slightly lower deposit rates offset a 4 basis point decline in loan yields. Securities yields increased 18 basis points due to slower premium amortization on mortgage-backed securities given the increase in market interest rates. Higher securities yields were the driver of net interest margin being modestly higher than our previous guidance. Net interest income increased $7 million sequentially, primarily due to solid loan growth offsetting the decline in loan yields.","Relative to the fourth quarter of 2012, net interest income was $29 million lower and the net interest margin declined 16 basis points. The primary drivers of both were lower loan yields and a reduction in commercial loan swap income, which were partially offset by lower deposit rates and a favorable shift in the deposit mix. Net interest income benefited from higher average earning assets. Looking forward, and assuming current rate expectations do occur, we expect the net interest margin to decline for the full year 2014 compared to the full year 2013, albeit at a lower rate relative to the decline we experienced this year.","The primary driver of this decline will be a further compression in loan yields due to the continued low short-term interest rate environment, partially offset by the benefits of a steepening curve. With regard to net interest income, we would anticipate year-over-year improvements, assuming loan growth continues. However, with respect to the first quarter, there are 2 fewer days, which all things being equal, has the impact of reducing net interest income by $10 million to $15 million.","Moving on to Slide 6. Adjusted noninterest income increased $64 million from the previous quarter due to the lease financing impairment we recognized in Q3 in addition to higher mortgage servicing and trading income. Excluding the impact of the repurchase settlements in the previous quarter, mortgage production income declined sequentially from $53 million to $31 million. This was principally driven by a decline in origination fees from $44 million to $23 million as a result of the approximate 50% decline in closed loan volume. Mortgage servicing income, however, increased 26 -- $27 million sequentially, primarily due to lower decay in the MSR asset, which is largely the result of lower refinance activity.","Trading income also increased by $24 million this quarter, which was driven by improvement in client-related trading revenues, alongside $14 million in combined mark-to-market gains on fair value of debts and the valuation of certain illiquid securities. Client-related trading income rose as improved market conditions increased activity amongst our fixed income product client base.","Investment banking had another strong quarter, though revenues were slightly lower on a sequential basis as a drop in fixed income origination revenue was partially offset by higher M&A and equity-related fees. Retail investment services continued its positive trend, resulting from fixed annuity sales and managed account growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted noninterest income declined $193 million, primarily due to lower mortgage production income as a result of both lower gain-on-sale margins and lower production volume. This was partially offset by solid improvement in wealth management-related revenues.","Let's move to expenses on Slide 7. Reported noninterest expense decreased $366 million from the previous quarter, driven entirely by the expenses associated with the third quarter legacy mortgage matters. On an adjusted basis, expenses increased $53 million sequentially. Compensation and benefits expense increased $41 million as a result of the $37 million reduction in incentive compensation in the third quarter. Operating losses also increased $15 million on an adjusted basis due to mortgage-related regulatory and legal expenses incurred this quarter.","Overall, as we observe on Slide 20 in the Appendix, our cyclical costs were $352 million for the full year, excluding the noted items from third quarter. This represents a significant decline from the $655 million we incurred in 2012. For 2014, we expect modest additional declines in aggregate cyclical costs, though the operating loss component can be volatile as evidenced by the quarterly trends we saw this year. Looking at year-over-year, I'm pleased with our Q4 noninterest expense reduction of 9%, which was driven by widespread reductions in core operating expense categories, as well as the abatement of cyclical costs. As we look to the first quarter, we currently anticipate approximately $50 million in higher 401(k) and FICA expenses and slightly higher medical benefits-related expenses to drive the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits and compensation expenses.","As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was slightly higher relative to the previous quarter, bringing the year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 65.8%. This represents over 6 percentage points of improvement relative to 2011 and 3.5 percentage points of improvement relative to 2012. We are disappointed that we did not meet our goal of approximately 65% for the full year, and we remain solidly focused on becoming a more efficient operator across all of our businesses. As we look to 2014, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio target is less than 64%. Future progress on the efficiency ratio will be more challenging relative to the achievements over the previous 2 years. However, we remain firmly committed to delivering on our long-term objective of less than 60%.","Turning to credit quality. Asset quality continued to improve this quarter with the net charge-off ratio declining from 47 basis points to 40 basis points sequentially. Nonperforming loans were also lower, declining 6% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. These improvements in asset quality drove a 7 basis point decline in the allowance for loan and lease-loss ratio. Recent improvements in asset quality continue to be driven by the stronger housing market through lower residential delinquencies, lower loss severities and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets. The loan-loss provision increased $6 million sequentially as the solid loan growth offset the improvements in asset quality. As we look to 2014, we expect further but moderating improvements in asset quality, primarily driven by residential loans. However, as we experienced this quarter, positive loan growth may offset future asset quality improvements, and thus impact sequential changes in the loan-loss provision.","Turning to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased by $3.1 billion or about 3%, which is the highest sequential quarter loan growth we have delivered since the first quarter 2012. End-of-period performing loans grew $3.6 billion as the result of a strong December. Growth was broad-based across most portfolios, though principally driven by C&I, CRE and nonguaranteed residential mortgage.","C&I loan growth was driven by the not-for-profit and government business, the commercial dealer group and broad-based growth across most CIB industry verticals. Average CRE loans were up 10% sequentially due to extended relationships with clients in our footprint, growth in our institutional business and success in our REIT platform. Nonguaranteed residential mortgages grew primarily due to the addition of high-quality jumbo mortgages to our portfolio. Lastly, consumer loan balances were also up modestly with growth across most portfolios. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $4.7 billion, driven by targeted growth in our C&I and CRE portfolios. Overall, loan growth was solid this quarter as the investments we had made in many of our businesses continued to bear fruit and the economic indicators in our markets continued to improve.","Let's take a look at deposits on Slide 11. Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially as growth in low-cost deposits, primarily NOW accounts, offset modest declines in higher-cost time deposits. Relative to the prior year, deposits were essentially flat, although the underlying favorable shift in the deposit mix is the more notable event. This favorable shift in deposit mix helped drive down interest-bearing deposit costs by 8 basis points year-over-year.","Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings. Our key capital ratios were generally stable as growth in the numerator was offset by the loan growth we delivered this quarter. In addition, tangible book value per share increased 3% due to the growth in total equity.","Pursuant to our 2013 capital plan, we have now completed our $200 million stock buyback program. Later this quarter, we will be notified of the results of our 2014 CCAR submission. And we will provide you more information on future capital returns at that time.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance and provide a recap of the full year.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and I'll start on Slide 13. We saw the continuation of several core operating trends in our business segments this quarter.","In our consumer banking and private wealth management business, significant net income growth was driven by ongoing credit and expense improvements. Noninterest income declined modestly from the same quarter last year, partially due to a onetime gain related to the student loan sales in the fourth quarter of last year. However, we experienced solid growth of 8% in wealth management-related revenues. Expenses were down 8%, partially the result of a more efficient branch network and staffing model as we reduced our number of branches by 7% over last year.","We made meaningful progress in our efforts to better align our distribution channels with evolving client preferences. Going forward, we do expect additional net reductions in our branch network. However, the overall rate of decline in 2014 will slow when compared to 2013. Furthermore, provision for credit losses decreased meaningfully as credit quality improved, almost entirely driven by home equity, given the improving housing market.","We've steadily improved the tangible efficiency ratio in this segment, driving it down approximately 350 basis points in the last year to 67.1%. Average loan balances were flat from last year due to the fourth quarter student loan sales, though we continue to see solid organic loan production, particularly in home equity, consumer, card, consumer direct and auto. Consumer loan production was up 8% year-over-year. Taking a look at 2013 in aggregate, net income was up 88%, driven by solid progress and our expense management efforts, along with our aforementioned credit quality improvements. Furthermore, similar to the quarter-to-quarter results, we generated 8% growth in consumer lending and 5% growth in wealth management-related revenues.","Let's take a closer look at our wholesale business. Wholesale had a strong quarter, with record net income of $259 million, continuing its positive momentum. Net interest income increased 4% due to solid loan and deposit growth. However, noninterest income declined primarily as a result of a onetime trading-related benefit and record investment banking income in the fourth quarter of 2012. The declines in noninterest income were the primary driver of the increase in the efficiency ratio when compared to the prior year.","Average loans grew $4.7 billion or 9% with further growth in core CRE, our not-for-profit and government business, our commercial dealer group and our large corporate lending areas, most notably asset securitization, asset-based lending and our energy and health care verticals. Overall, our pipelines continued to be healthy and have demonstrated year-over-year growth. And while wholesale loan yields compressed in the fourth quarter, it was at a slower pace than we've previously been experiencing.","Wholesale has been a growth driver and should continue to provide solid performance for us in 2014. 2013 marked a record year for investment banking income. And it's important to note that the revenue mix here is increasingly diverse. CRE also continues to grow across our 4 main target areas. Our wholesale business is very well positioned to compete and we have meaningful runway in each of our key lines of business.","Let's look at mortgage. The net loss in mortgage this quarter was stable through the same quarter last year as revenue declines were offset by lower provision expense as credit quality improved, along with other expense reductions due to the abatement of cyclical cost and our efforts to right-size this business. Taking a closer look at revenue, noninterest income was negatively impacted by the decline in mortgage production volume and gain-on-sale margins. Servicing income also decreased modestly year-over-year, given the lower net hedge performance, and increased sequentially, given the lower decay in the MSR asset.","So looking ahead, we continue to expect growth in purchase market originations, though it will not offset the significant decline in refinance activity we experienced this past year. Expenses were down 21% compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to make good progress here. You'll recall in the third quarter, we outlined our intent to reduce core expenses by approximately $50 million a quarter from the third quarter core run rate or about 20%. We should begin to see this come fully into the run rate in the second quarter.","So in summary, we're taking the actions we believe are necessary to return this business to profitability. We'll continue to be responsive to changes in the evolving operating environment and the opportunities within our markets. So before we get into the Q&A though, I'd like to take a step back and look at our corporate performance maybe in aggregate for the year.","During the course of 2013, SunTrust made meaningful progress in several key areas. This progress is reflected in the 25% growth in adjusted earnings per share over the prior year. Bottom line gains were driven by a notable 12% decline in adjusted noninterest expense, both as a result of better expense management and the decline in cyclical costs. Further significant credit quality improvement with net charge-offs declining 60% and nonperforming loans down 37% drove marked year-over-year reductions in our provision for credit losses.","From a revenue perspective, we had a considerable mortgage income headwind. Production in servicing income were down significantly as market conditions changed quickly during the year. In addition, net interest expense -- net interest income declined 5% over the past year due to continued low-rate environment. Despite a very challenging year for revenue, we were able to reduce our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio 350 basis points to 65.8%.","However, as Aleem noted, we fell short of our target of 65% for the year, given the rapid decline in mortgage revenues. We are still managing to a sub 60% efficiency ratio. And as Aleem articulated, we'll continue to make progress towards that long-term goal in 2014 with the expectation that we'll be below 64% for the full year.","Further, to reduce uncertainty and improve our overall risk profile, it was important to get key legacy mortgage-related matters behind us as quickly as practical. And we're able to do much of that during 2013, allowing us to more firmly focus on the future of the company and the opportunities we see across all of our businesses. The considerable progress we've made thus far to improve the efficiency of our business, reduce our overall risk profile and deliver improved bottom line performance has translated into better returns for our shareholders. The bottom line is that we're building a more effective and efficient company. I believe we have a strong chassis from which we'll be able to generate further momentum as we look to 2014 and beyond.","So before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to thank our teammates for all that they've done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients and our ongoing drive toward delivering improved performance for our shareholders. So teammates, thank you.","Well, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and we'll start the Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Great. Thank you, Bill. And Jill, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have our first question, it's from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can we start off with the new efficiency goal for 2014? I think it looks better than some of us were expecting. Can you just give us a little bit more clarity in terms of what you're expecting for revenue growth, particularly fee income? And then on the expense side, I know you're going through the review of the $1.5 billion of expenses. Can you give us a sense of what you're including in your efficiency guidance for that?","Aleem Gillani","Sure, Ryan. Well, let me take a crack at that. For overall revenue, as we look at 2014, we actually see several opportunities. First of all, on net interest income with the loan growth that we've delivered and with the momentum that we ended the year on, I think that if we continue to be able to deliver that kind of loan growth, I would expect it to more than offset the margin decline over the course of the year. So I'm looking to actually higher net income in -- net interest income in '14 as a result of loan growth. I think in fee income, we've got lots of opportunities in various areas of the company. And you saw some of that show up in Q4 in our consumer and private wealth business and in the improvements that, I think, we can continue to deliver in CIB. So I'm looking for growth in fee income in those areas. In terms of expenses for the year, you look back at what -- where we were and you remember, we used to have a quarterly expense run rate overall that was always in the sort of $1.5 billion, $1.55 billion range. For '13, what we're able to do is get that number down into the $1.3 billion range. And I like that number a lot better. So as I look into '14, I would think that our expense run rate in 2014 is going to continue to start with a sort of a $1.3 billion number on a quarterly run rate basis.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Thanks for the clarity, Aleem. And if I could just ask one other question, just in terms of credit, your charge-offs are coming down nicely, but resi is still elevated at 75 basis points. I know you recently noted at our conference that losses on the last 4 years' vintages were 2.5 basis points. So can you just give us a sense of over what timeframe do you think you can get losses in that book down to that sort of a level? And just when I think about the reserve from here at 4x annual charge-offs and you made comments about needing to provide for growth, how do we think about the interplay between charge-offs continuing to come down but needing to provide for new loan growth?","Thomas E. Freeman","Yes, I'll take it. It's Tom Freeman. So I think if you take a look, our focus right now is we still have half our portfolio, which are older vintages, half our portfolio, which are newer vintages. The older vintages continued to show improvement in their performance over time. I would think that, that improvement will continue over the next couple of years. I think the noted improvement in the home equities is generally when the home equities had defaulted, we took a 100% loss on the home equities. That is abating. And in fact, as housing prices begin to rally, our loss characteristics are significantly better than that. And just to be really clear, an expectation that we're going to have 2.5 basis point loss profile on that portfolio, I would think, is unreasonably optimistic. But I think the balance will continue to show some improvement over the next year, especially in those 2 areas. And that's it.","Aleem Gillani","Ryan, if you think about where we were overall, our over the cycle range for charge-offs, what we're expecting is in the 40 to 70 basis point range. We're now down at the very bottom end of that range. Given the quality of portfolio today, I wouldn't be surprised that we dip below the bottom end of that range temporarily, which is a nice place to be. But also given the solid loan growth that is starting to show up now, I wouldn't be surprised if provisions exceed charge-offs as we look forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","This is actually Bryan in for Ken Usdin. In the fourth quarter, the efficiency ratio was 66.8% and you guys talked about some of the first quarter headwinds, like the increased benefits expense and the impact of day count, NII. So it just seems like to go from close to 67% down to 64% for the full year '14 is pretty aggressive. You guys talked about the NII being up and the fees potentially growing. But what specifically outside of mortgage costs can you do on the expense side to bring the expense base down and hit that 64% ratio?","Aleem Gillani","Ken, we've got several things that we're working on outside the mortgage costs, but let's not dismiss the mortgage costs immediately. That's going to be significant. I think we talked about last quarter the idea that we're -- as we're rightsizing that business, we'll be able to take $50 million a quarter out of the run rate on the expense base. And that's what we're expecting for the full year. In 1 quarter, I don't think we're going to get to our target in 1 quarter. And it's, as you pointed out, it's a challenging target. We're not making this easy on ourselves or our teammates. But along with mortgage, we've also talked about our overall ops transformation, our focus on core infrastructure, core operations and thinking that we're going to be able to extract efficiencies from that business. And in addition, we're still making changes in our overall footprint and corporate real estate. And I think we'll be able to take dollars out of that space also. Let me give you one quick example. This weekend, we're moving over 100 teammates in our greater Washington area out of 2 separate buildings and 3 separate floors into sort of 1 common space, where they're going to be able to actually work together, become more effective in the way in which we cover both the business and the personal needs of our corporate client base. But alongside with doing that and making our teammates more productive, we're going to be taking $100,000 a month out of their space bill, out of the rent that we're going to be paying, and that starts next month. So there are lots of opportunities like that, that were focusing on along the way, along with continued dialogue with our suppliers and working with them in partnership to bring down our overall external costs.","William Henry Rogers","This is Bill. I think it's important, and you noted it. I mean, it will be bumpy. This isn't -- we're going to be on a trend towards this efficiency ratio, and quarter-to-quarter, we'll be bumpy. But I feel confident that we've got the infrastructure in place, the momentum on both the expense and the revenue side. This is a combination of both to get us there by the end of the year, barring anything highly unusual.","Bryan Batory - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how should we think about the RidgeWorth sale that's expected to close in the third quarter of '14? What sort of revenue give-ups should we be expecting and how much impact should that have on expenses?","Aleem Gillani","Actually, right now, we're thinking that we'll close it in the second quarter, not the third quarter. And if you think about sort of the bottom line benefit of RidgeWorth, as we said in the press release when we announced the transaction, RidgeWorth contributed about $25 million to the bottom line during the first 3 quarters of 2012. So that gives you a sense of the run rate overall coming out of RidgeWorth. And it was sort of slightly decretive to the corporate efficiency ratio.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. And I think given our commitment on the efficiency ratio and given this is a second quarter item, it's a smaller transaction total, this is not the driver of our getting to the efficiency ratio. It's just one small element, in fairness.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","The commercial real estate had some nice growth quarter-to-quarter. And obviously, it's still off of a relatively small number. But could you just talk a bit about the opportunity there? I think you signed a deal with a big insurance company to help source some loans. So what's the opportunity, I guess, both on the lending side and then if there's any fee revenues that could be generated from that arrangement?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I mean, we've been talking now for several quarters that we sort of turned that inflection point in commercial real estate, where now we're really starting to see core growth. And as you said, albeit on a small basis, the growth is actually pretty significant and an appreciable part of our total growth. And it's -- the good news is it's very diverse. It's sort of from our REIT investments, it's from the things we do in geography, in multifamily, in retail, office, industrial, sort of depending on where any one of those individual markets have opportunity in our institutional market. So it's very diverse in terms of our growth. The deal with MetLife is an important part but not the only part. It represents something like 7% of our total portfolio. So it's what I consider to be maybe 1 of the cylinders of an 8-cylinder engine versus the primary cylinder. And fee business is something that we are driving. I think of our commercial real estate business more like a CIB vertical. So just like we've built up the talent and the capability on the loan origination side, similarly we built up the talent and the capability on the fee-generating side. So in the last quarter, we participated in a lot of deals, led a few related to both equity and debt in the commercial real estate side. And 12 months ago, that number would have been 0. So pretty dramatic improvement on both sides.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just in terms of how big you're willing to let commercial real estate get, it's about $5 billion right now. How should we think about relative to your overall balance sheet? Understanding that some of these deals can be chunky, how big are you willing to let that get?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. It's a good question. And basically what I tell the teams is, \"Keep growing, and I'll tell you when to stop.\" Because right now, I don't think we're going to run up short-term against the limit. And the way that we're growing the business from diversity in both the size, geography, types of business, I'm not worried about the kind of things that you see in terms of concentration. So I think we're going to let it run a little bit here the next couple of years, and then we'll sort of see where we get to from a total portfolio size. The good news is other parts of our business are growing as well. So its percent of the pie will also be determined by how big the pie gets.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Back -- sorry to go back to the expenses again here, but on the -- real just quickly on the other expense line, can you just give us a little bit of color there on what drove the number in the quarter? I think it stayed around similar to last quarter's levels, which I thought were also elevated. So I'm just wondering if that other expense item can come down. And then also on the expense side, in terms of your efficiency target, just wondering if it's still fair to assume that half of the improvement in the efficiency ratio over time here should come from the expenses and while half could come from the top line.","Aleem Gillani","I think we had a couple of items that went into that other expense line this quarter that might be a little bit lumpy. And one of those was the point that Bill made in his opening remarks and my point about we had operating and legal costs this quarter that were mortgage-related. So we had an item in there that raised that number slightly higher. But if you think about 2014 overall, there are several numbers in there, several items within that line item that we are focused on that we are attempting to bring down and that I'm optimistic we're going to be able to work on over the course of the year to bring the overall cost down.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the efficiency ratio target, just if you can give us a little bit of color of how much of that could come from expense reduction and then how much would come from revenue.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I think the chart we did in the investor presentation hopefully gives a good example of that and where it actually comes from by business. So for example, on the mortgage side, 3\/4, we sort of did Harvey Balls, and 3\/4 of the effort there will be the expense side. So that will be a lot expense-driven relative to revenue. Wholesale, on the other side, will be much more revenue than expense-driven. I mean, it already operates at a fairly good efficiency ratio, and then in the consumer and private wealth, more balanced. On the private wealth side, more on the revenue side. And on the sort of the core retail side, we still will have some expense opportunities and some revenue. So it's a little more balanced than we've been in the past. And you saw some evidence of that, I think, in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to Ryan's line of questioning. Aleem, you mentioned that you're going to start with a $1.3 billion handle on expenses for next -- for this year. And I appreciate that there's going to be some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter, particularly with seasonality and the timing of the mortgage cost coming out. So as I think about modeling for 2014, is $5.2 billion a fair sort of starting point as I think about your expense base for this year for the full year?","Aleem Gillani","Erika, I think what I said was that I expect the number to start with a $1.3 billion overall for the year. So yes, there might be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But I think what I expect is that, that number will have a $1.3 billion every quarter, not necessarily as a starting point. And somewhere in that range, I think, is where we'll end up. And of course, it's revenue-based. So if we do get some revenue increases, that will have some expense implications also.","William Henry Rogers","I mean, we're really managing to the efficiency ratio. And I think we're going to monitor closely sort of where we are on the revenue side and where we are on the expense side and adjust accordingly when we have the ability.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just as a follow-up on that, we appreciate the margin and the NII guidance. I'm just wondering, could we look forward to the margin bottoming in 2014? Or is sort of the -- is there additional pressure from 2015 simply from the swap income continuing to roll off?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think that depends on your view of rates overall. If the curve continues to steepen from here or we get the rate rises that we may get as a result of the Fed's easing coming off in '15, that's certainly going to help the margin from thereon. As you know, the way we're structured is we'll benefit much more as a company, given our balance sheet structure, if short rates start to go up. And if the Fed does start to bring short rates up in '15, that will really help us from a net interest income perspective, given the way our balance sheet is structured now. Additionally, your point about the swap income rolling off, Erika, as that happens at the end of '14 and into '15, we will start to get much more asset-sensitive. And if short rates start to move up in '15 as we currently think they might, that will benefit us considerably at that point.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Can you guys share with us -- when you look at your Tier 1 common ratio now at about 9.6% and if you say regional banks like your own are required to carry 7%, obviously you're going to want to carry a cushion above that. Philosophically, in the future, because I think return of capital is going to be important for valuations, where do you guys think you want to keep your Tier 1 common ratio if you're required again to have a 7% number plus some cushion?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I guess, first of all, the first question, Gerard, is how big is that cushion. And as you know, we're still -- the industry is still looking for some guidance from the regulators as to what that G-SIB and domestic SIFI cushion is going to be. So if you start with 7%, as you're starting with, to begin with, you add some type of SIFI cushion on top of that, a SIFI requirement on top of that. I'm not sure exactly yet what that's going to be. But looking at where the overall G-SIB requirements are, that kind of number might be on the order of 50 to 75 basis points. And then of course, our board is going to want to make sure that we have a cushion on top of that to make sure that we don't fall south of the regulatory required number. So at the end of the day, if you put all those together, having a number that starts with an 8% overall, I don't think, is unfair. But where we sit within that and what type of additional cushion we're going to have on top of that at this point is still a little bit unclear.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","There hasn't -- it doesn't seem to be much discussion lately of the domestic SIFI number. Obviously, SLR [ph] has taken over. But are you guys still hearing from the regulators that there is going to be a domestic SIFI buffer?","Aleem Gillani","At this point, Gerard, I just don't know. Obviously, they've started at the global level with the G-SIBs. But to the extent that they decide there's going to be a domestic SIFI number, given the size of our company, I could envision a day where they say all banks above $50 billion in assets are structurally important.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then philosophically, once you get to the desired levels and you are maybe above what you think is you need, could you guys conceptually -- or assuming the regulators would allow it, would you ever consider giving back 100% of your earnings in a form of obviously dividends and share repurchases?","Aleem Gillani","Well, the first and best use of our capital, I think, is using it by doing client business. So to the extent that we're able to grow our business and meet more client needs, that will be the first call in our capital. I'm actually pretty happy with this quarter and the way in which we were able to use 0.1% of our overall capital ratio to grow client business and do real loans. So that would be the first call in our business. If we aren't able to get client growth and real growth, then we'll look at other opportunities to deploy that capital. But hopefully, that's not the number one thing we're going to look at.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then my second just follow-up question, on your commercial real estate business, the success that you're having, obviously we know about the residential markets have recovered or are recovering. What do you guys see in the commercial real estate, whether it's office buildings, suburban office or industrial space? In your footprint, is there meaningful improvement in those markets, like we're seeing in residential markets?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I think it's by market. You would see an individual one of those segments improving, and we'll look at it by market. And we're not limited to just our geography. I mean, this is going to -- this is a business that has a lot of diversity. So if you look within our geography and you look nationally, multifamily has certainly been one of those areas that has responded more quickly. But in certain places, we're already worried about some overheating. And in those areas, we'll not be as aggressive as we'll be in other areas. Office and industrial, probably a little bit ahead. Retail is probably slow, particularly in our markets. I think you have to say existing centers are doing better, so that's good news. But you don't see a lot of new retail yet. I think that will be probably the last one to come back.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners.","Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division","Bill and Aleem, I was curious on the issue of loan paydowns and to what extent that could be a positive influencer to loan growth in 2014.","Aleem Gillani","Loan paydowns, Chris? Help me understand your question.","Christopher W. Marinac - FIG Partners, LLC, Research Division","Paydowns, payoffs of loans as you look to the portfolio.","William Henry Rogers","Real slowing.","Aleem Gillani","Slowing? Yes, well, that started to show up in Q4. We started to see that with the increase in rates both our direct clients and then also through the securities portfolio, as paydowns slowed, the effects of that, as you saw in our margin, was actually to reduce the premium amortization in the securities book. And as the duration of our assets extended a little bit, the benefit of that was an increase in yield and an increase in overall income. So as one driver of our overall growth in assets and growth in loans, that was certainly one of them.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. And I think you see that on the loan side of that most acutely in the home equity portfolio. It's about a $14 billion portfolio for that, that has been attriting pretty consistently, and that's reaching an inflection point. And actually the production of home equity has been good to exceptionally good. We'll start to see some more organic growth as that attrition stops.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","On mortgage volumes, I guess, one of the things I'm scratching my head on is you guys were down by about I think it was 50% linked quarter. The MBA has down 25% or so linked quarter. But if I look at Chase, if I look at BofA, if I look at Wells, they're all down roughly the same as you. I mean, I think the range is 38% to 52%. So I mean, is there some evidence of a big transfer of market share to small banks and nonbanks? Or are we all just working off the wrong market size? And if it's the latter, is there any evidence of -- does it feel like some volume was just pushed from 4Q to 1Q because the holidays and stuff like? Or does it just feel like maybe the market was estimated too big?","William Henry Rogers","No. I think let me try to take a shot at this. If you look at us and you saw some of the amount of refinance we had in our portfolio, this is really sort of a refinance backlog in the second quarter. If you look at us in the third quarter, you'd sort of say we were higher. So those questions would have come the other way, so you guys looked like you were higher than everybody else. And now that's sort of run its course. That's sort of run itself through. And so you see that as a comparison then about a little bit higher third quarter to the little bit lower fourth quarter in terms of decrease in production. I think on the market share issue, it's actually the opposite of what you suggested. We're seeing -- we look at that fairly carefully. And in the places where we want to maintain and the places where we want to grow our market share, I feel actually fairly good about that. And in our markets, going forward, we see that purchase market coming back. This is always the hardest on time to talk about it because you're in that first quarter, and it's way down, always down when it's a traditional cyclical market. The second, third quarters can be as high as double of what they are when you start the year. But the traditional purchase market, I think, sort of plays into our brand. We've been a traditional purchase bank. We don't have to reintroduce ourselves to realtors. We don't have to reintroduce ourselves to centers of influence. This is a business that we've done well before and we have maintained to grow our market share.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","That's very helpful. On kind of some of the profitability goals, clearly the focus right now is getting to where you want to be on efficiency. If I'm reading the proxy right, which is a big if, it seems like a 1% ROA is a pretty important goal in 2015 for some of the incentive plans. And I wonder if you could just talk about as you look beyond this efficiency push, is it going to be more of an ROA focus from kind of 2015 and beyond? Is 1% kind of what you're thinking of as a normal level or just a stepping stone? And I guess, within that, does the 1% in your view require a change in the environment, better growth, higher rates? Or is 1% an ROA that you think you can get to over time even if we stay in this very low-rate, sluggish environment?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I mean, I think you read the proxy correctly. And the -- we talk a lot about the efficiency ratio, but I don't want you to think that's sort of the exclusive North Star. I mean, we are managing the company to be great stewards of the assets. And you've seen, as we talk about the efficiency ratio, you've also seen the improvement in the ROA, not the least of which was this quarter, sort of significant improvement in ROA. And that's been pretty consistent across this pattern. So while I put that hard stake in the efficiency ratio, I can assure you that it is consistent, I believe, with also growing the ROA of the business in the way that we're accomplishing the efficiency ratio target. So I think we have a business that over several years can be a north of 1% ROA business. And clearly, that line was put in the sand. I don't think it's totally rate-dependent. But certainly, rates over that period would expedite the ability to get to that goal.","Operator","And our last question will come from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Aleem, I want to talk to you a little about your repositioning of the balance sheet, allowing the swaps to run off. Can you give us a feel for the magnitude of the increase in asset sensitivity you're trying to accomplish and kind of what are the parameters that would make you want to stop doing -- create more of a balanced approach if you thought the rate increase was going to be later?","Aleem Gillani","Marty, that's a great question. Let me just step back and look back a little bit. The way we got here is that over the last few years coming into this, we've been more liability-sensitive. And as short-term rates were declining, as rates were declining overall, being liability-sensitive, looking back, looks like it was the right thing to do. Over the last 18 months or so, I'd characterize our position really as being more generally neutral. We've turned from being liability-sensitive to slightly liability-sensitive to being essentially neutral to now being slightly asset-sensitive but within a neutral band. So we're preparing for a move in rates, but I don't think it's going to occur immediately. We saw the curve steepen, and we saw long-term rates go up, but we really haven't seen short-term rates go up at all. And I don't expect, Marty, that short-term rates are going to move up in 2014 at all. So we're not preparing ourselves to get significantly asset-sensitive this year. If it happens, that's great. We're slightly positioned and we will benefit from that. But I'm actually not expecting that in '14. So what we're doing is we're turning the balance sheet slightly and over time to prepare for a secular change. And if in 2015 the Fed acts and starts to move up short-term rates, we'll be prepared for that when that happens. And the big benefit, I think, will come both in the rate move and in the way we're structured in '15. But I wouldn't expect to see much of a change in our overall structure in '14 or much of a change in short-term rates either.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And Bill, as we're seeing the loan growth starting to kind of pick up, the side effect of that is what we're seeing in investment banking revenues and the fee income. So as the economy takes hold, we are looking at a different competitive environment. So I just thought if you could talk a little bit about how you think the benefit as you're hitting each year's sequential records in investment banking because it's kind of volatile and lumpy, so it's hard to kind of depend on it. But over time, you should see the benefit of being able to play a bigger part in that market.","William Henry Rogers","I feel like you've asked and answered the question. But I'll take a swing because I think your supposition is exactly right. And it's predicated, as you know, about our businesses that we're building an investment banking business, not separate from our franchise but attached to our franchise. So the asset growth is very much tied into the fee growth. And although it's lumpy, if you look at the last 3 quarters, investment banking revenue was above $90 million for 3 quarters. I can remember not too many years ago, that was the annual production in that business. So tied into the ROA question earlier is these things are linked. We really -- we look at every asset we put on the books and we look at its fee opportunity. And certainly, in the commercial and up category, it's tied in to the investment banking opportunity as a big part of that discussion and dialogue.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And how would you just characterize the change in the competitive environment that gives you this opportunity?","William Henry Rogers","Well, I mean, it's very competitive. So I don't want to pull any punches on the competitiveness of the environment. I think just from our perspective, the skill and the capability and the talent that we've been building over the last 5 years is just starting to pay dividends. So it's selective, it's opportunistic and, I think, unique to some of the skill and the capabilities that we've built over the last several years.","Ankur Vyas","All right. This concludes our call.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I am going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll review our performance at the business segment level.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.89 on net income to common of $467 million, up 14% per share sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year adjusted EPS. We demonstrated good progress this quarter on key strategies and goals, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns.","Revenue improved 4% over the previous quarter, but declined 2% from the prior year adjusted level. The sequential quarter increase can be attributed to both higher net interest income and non-interest income.","Net interest margin benefited from targeted balance sheet actions during the quarter, in addition to slight improvement in core loan yields and continued growth in deposits. Average performing loans were down slightly from the prior quarter due primarily the loan sale activity driven by our continued focus on returns and pay downs of certain loan categories.","We remained confident in our ability to generate targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate and our relationships are deeper and we will continue to closely manage areas where the competitive environment is driving down returns.","Average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% year-over-year with continued broad-based growth driven by improved focus, better execution and enhanced capabilities. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability.","Adjusted non-interest income grew 7% sequentially as we deepen client relationships across the company evidenced by growth in investment banking, retail investment income and card fees.","Mortgage related income declined sequentially, largely as a result of higher rates in the quarter, which drove lower refinance activity and higher hedging-related costs.","Adjusted expenses were down 2% from the prior year driven by lower operating losses on the sale of RidgeWorth. Sequentially adjusted expenses increased 3%, a strong overall performance, higher client activity levels and typical seasonal patterns generated increases in certain variable expense categories.","In addition, we continue to invest in key growth areas. The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio 63.4% for the current quarter, which improved sequentially and year-over-year, and we are continue to work towards the very challenging goal of being sub 63 for the full year 2015.","Our asset quality performance remained strong, with NPLs down 21% as we transfer the portion of the portfolio to held for sale. The net charge-off ratio declined to 26 basis points reaching new multiyear lows.","Our asset quality performance can be attributed in part to the significant actions we have taken over the past several years to de-risk and diversify, and improve the quality of our production. ROI was 103 basis points this quarter, an 11% -- 11 basis points increase sequentially and a 3 basis point improvement relative to last year\u2019s adjusted performance.","Return metrics are important to us and we continue to focus on strategies to deepen client relationships and optimize the usage and mix of the balance sheet. Our capital position improved slightly with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on all Basel III fully phased-in basis.","Growth in tangible book value per share also continued, up slightly from prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year. Sequential increases in capital ratio and tangible book value occurred alongside of 36% increase in our total capital return to shareholders.","So to recap, net interest margin is beginning to show signs of stabilization, partially as a result of our balance sheet management efforts as we are cautiously optimistic that we are seeing the trough in net interest income.","Conversely provision expense is likely at or near the bottom even if asset quality continues a condition remains strong. Non-interest income trends were positive and reflective of our continued efforts to meet more client needs the quarterly variability can be expected.","Our focus on expense management and improving efficiency will remain high. Overall, I'm optimistic about our company strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value of our shareholders.","So with that as a brief overview, I will turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the results.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the second quarter were $0.89, which was 14% higher than the first quarter and also 10% higher than adjusted EPS in the second quarter of last year.","As you'll recall, adjustments to the second quarter of 2014 included the settlement of certain legacy mortgage matters, partially offset by the gain on sale of RidgeWorth, the net of which was a negative $0.09 per share impact to earnings.","Sequential quarter increase was driven by 4% revenue growth, a decline in the provision expense and a $0.03 discrete tax benefit in the current quarter. Non-interest expense did increase sequentially, but this was primarily related to business performance and activity levels, in addition to certain discrete items in the current and prior quarter, which I will discuss later.","Compared to the second quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by improved asset quality performance, continued expense discipline and higher mortgage and capital markets-related revenue, which together more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue and lower commercial loan swap income.","We will now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on slide five. Net interest income increased to 2% sequentially, driven by one additional day, an improvement in core loan yields and higher commercial loan swap income.","The premium amortization expense related to the securities portfolio was stable sequentially, but will slightly decline next quarter due to portfolio actions we undertook during the period.","Net interest margin improved to 3 basis points, primarily due to commercial loan swap income and a slight increase in consumer and mortgage loan yields. Relative to the guidance we have provided in April, balance sheet management actions in the quarter, including adjusting duration and repaying higher cost wholesale funding benefited NIM.","Core C&I loan yields were stable sequentially, a positive sign after multiple quarters of continuous declines. With that said, new production C&I yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields and thus will likely put further pressure on the overall margin.","We remained intensely focused on ensuring that we meet the full suite of our wholesale banking clients needs, particularly with respect to capital markets, and treasury and payment products.","On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $41 million, driven entirely by lower commercial loan swap income. Core margin compression due to the continued low rate environment was offset by positive loan and deposit growth.","Looking forward, we expect third quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the second quarter level, as the balance sheet management actions of the second quarter will fully be in the run rate and potentially offset core loan yield compression.","Despite the potential for stability next quarter, NIM will likely still grind down after that, until interest rate begin to rise. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to have a positive tilt towards rising rates and expect any increase in rates to be gradual and deliberately paced.","Moving on to slide six, non-interest income increased $57 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher investment banking activity, growth in retail investment income and seasonal increases in other non-interest income categories, which offset the decline in mortgage-related income. Investment banking had a strong quarter with revenues increasing $48 million as growth occurred across almost all product area.","Trading income was stable as lower core client driven activity was offset by higher fair value marks on our debt. Mortgage production income declined $7 million due to lower lock volume and reduced gain-on sale margins. We record gain-on sale revenue at the time of rate lock and thus the majority of revenues related to the refinance activity of the prior quarter were recorded at that time.","Mortgage servicing income declined $13 million due to higher decay expense as a result of the increase in closed loans and higher hedging costs given the increase rate volatility throughout the quarter. Retail investment income and card fees combined increased $12 million sequentially as we continue to deepen client relationships in the consumer related businesses.","We also recorded $14 million in net securities gains and a similar amount of debt extinguishment cost, which are recorded in noninterest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net lease transactions had no upfront P&L impact but modestly improved our forward NIM and net interest income profile. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted net interest income increased slightly as growth in capital markets and mortgage related income was able to offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenue.","Let\u2019s move on to expenses on slide seven. Adjusted noninterest expense increased $34 million sequentially due to business activity and performance in the second quarter, in addition to typical seasonal trends. Personnel expense declined $15 million due mainly to the seasonal decline in benefits costs and FICA taxes, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation given improved business performance.","Outside processing and software costs increased $15 million as a result of higher business activity levels and continued investments in technology as well as typical quarterly variability associated with the timing of rendering service. Marketing and customer development expense also increased $7 million as the first quarter typically has lower advertising cost.","Other noninterest expense increased $38 million, primarily due to $14 million of debt extinguishment costs recorded in the current quarter and $17 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the prior quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted noninterest expense was down 2%, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, lower operating losses and our continued overall focus around expense management.","As you can see on slide eight, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 63.4% in the second quarter, down 110 basis points compared to the prior quarter and 20 basis points better than last year. We delivered year-over-year improvement despite of $40 million decline in commercial loan swap income as we were able to grow noninterest income and reduced expense.","As we've indicated in the prior two earnings calls, improvement in 2015 will be difficult given our significant progress last year in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. We will need to deliver strong efficiency and PPNR performance in the second half of the year to achieve our goal of being below 63% for 2015. We are working diligently to achieve this goal but as Bill indicated earlier, it will be challenging.","Turning to credit quality on slide nine where our performance continues to be strong. Nonperforming loans declined 21% sequentially, primarily driven by the transfer of $110 million of loans to held-for-sale status. In addition, the net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the quarter, down 4 basis points from the prior quarter and 9 basis points from the prior year.","The allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $59 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the even further improvements in asset quality combined with more moderate loan growth during the second quarter. In addition, the results of the recent shared international credit exam are already reflected in our June 30th allowance.","With respect to the energy portfolio, we have taken proactive actions in prior quarters to build reserves. And we will continue to remain vigilant given the uncertainty associated with oil and gas prices. Asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable over the medium term given the economic environment combined with the proactive actions we've taken to derisk, diversify and improve the quality of production.","With that said, any given quarter may be impacted by discrete items, particularly given today\u2019s low overall net charge-off and nonperforming ratio. Over the next couple of quarters, we expect provision expense to increase relative to the current quarter but remain lower than similar periods in 2014 given continued improvements in asset quality. After that, improvements in asset quality will abate and economic and growth conditions will normalize. And thus we would expect provision expense to much more closely match in that charge-off.","The ultimate level of reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review processes, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio combined with a view on economic conditions. Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet, average performing loans declined slightly, primarily due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization we completed during the quarter, combined with continued elevated pay downs in certain segments, given the low interest rates and credit spread environment.","The auto loan securitization was our inaugural transaction and its success can be attributed to the strong one team approach we have across many units within the company. Going forward, we will periodically conduct additional securitization transactions as they allow us to more efficiently use the balance sheet and diversify our funding sources, well still being an active loan originator and partner to our auto dealers and clients.","C&I loans were relatively stable as growth in the number of industry verticals and the client segments was offset by targeted reductions in lower return areas. Consumer direct loans were higher, given continued growth in our online businesses.","On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.4 billion or 2%, driven by strong 9% growth in the C&I portfolio partially offset by reductions in residential mortgage, indirect auto and student loans, largely due to the balance sheet management and optimization activities we have executed over the past few quarters.","Consumer loans were unchanged year-over-year. However, the mix has improved with growth in higher return direct segments offset by reductions in lower return indirect segment. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients\u2019 growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and client activity levels remain healthy. And we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.","Let\u2019s turn to deposits on slide 11. Average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 9% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business.","We\u2019re pleased with the improving momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects the overall focus on meeting more clients deposit and payment needs, supplemented by the investments in technology platforms and client facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth, and wholesale segments. Our corporate liquidity specialist within wholesale banking, our premier bankers within retail and our SummitView product are all specific examples of investments in talent and technology that have supported this deposit growth.","Importantly, the solid growth we\u2019ve delivered has not resulted in any adverse change in rates paid or mix. Low growth -- low cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher cost deposits continue to gradually decline.","As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the non-rate based value proposition for clients.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings. While the estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was fairly stable at 9.8%.","Tangible book value per share increased slightly from the prior quarter as growth in retained earnings offset the lower AOCI. Importantly, tangible book value per share is up a solid 7% year-over-year.","The second quarter also marks the beginning of our 2015 capital plan. We repurchased $175 million of common stock, up from a $115 million in the prior quarter and paid the $0.24 dividend, up 20% from the previous levels.","Our capital return program combined with disciplined usage of employee stock-based compensation continues to gradually drive down share counts. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 4 million sequentially and 13 million year-over-year. And lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement for 90%.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level.","Bill Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment, net income increased meaningfully relative to prior quarter and prior year, with a lower provision expense being the key driver. Core operating performance was also solid with revenue up 4%, which when combined with stable expenses resulted in strong operating leverage, a 220 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio and 13% year-over-year growth on pre-provision net revenue.","Net interest income has been steadily driving higher in this segment, both due to our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans declined sequentially due to the $1 billion auto loan securitization and also a $350 million student loan sale that was completed in April.","Offsetting these reductions were solid growth on higher return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card. The loan sale activity and growth in the direct portfolios are consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company.","Profits were up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net worth segment. Our premier bankers in the Summitview platform are examples of talent and technology that are enabling this growth.","Non-interest income growth was solid, both sequentially and compared to a year ago. Retail investment income continues to grow, up 5% year-over-year, in large part due to increased client assets under management in our brokerage platform as we are meeting more of our client\u2019s wealth management needs.","Card fees and credit card balances are also on a positive track. Continued growth in these areas will be important, particularly given the downward pressure on traditional service charges. Expenses were flat compared to the prior quarter and year, as we maintained a disciplined approach to expense management, while investing in areas associated with revenue growth initiatives.","As I stated earlier, this strategy has been paying off as we're achieving positive operating leverage in this business. Bigger picture, the prolonged low rate environment continues to place pressure on the value of deposits. However, the balance sheet management strategies we have executed had mitigated some of this pressure. Our continued focus on meeting more client needs has generated positive momentum with regard to non-interest income and deposits and we have further opportunity here.","We continued to invest in our various digital platforms and we are seeing results with steady increases in digital penetration and self-service deposits. The Southeast and Mid-Atlantic economies continued to perform well and are well positioned to meet -- and we are well positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.","Now moving onto wholesale banking, which has been the key growth engine for the company and it posted a very strong quarter with net income up 11% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Revenues grew 9% relative to the prior year and were record, driven by broad-based growth across life of businesses and products.","Net interest income was up 8% over the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth, but this was partially offset by decline in loan spreads. While loan yields did stabilized sequentially, we would still expect modest downward pressure going forward given the current environment for new production yields.","Average loans were flat sequentially and up 10% year-over-year, driven by gains across most of our client segments. Our markets remain competitive and we are being more selective to ensure we earn appropriate overall relationship returns. Loan pipelines are healthy and commitments are growing, both of which demonstrate increased activity in both new client acquisition and expanding existing relationships.","Deposits were up 2% sequentially and 13% year-over-year and the success here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payments product offerings along with the success of our liquidity specialist effort, allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients\u2019 deposit needs.","Non-interest income was up 10% over the prior year, driven by record performances in multiple investment, banking product groups, including syndications, high-yield investment grade and equity capital markets. Our market share gains are direct result of the continued investment and talent to expand and diversify our capabilities, but also due to our continued move towards the less lead on deals as bankers continue to have more strategic dialogue with clients.","This is further evidenced by the fact that our M&A and equity related revenues in the first half of 2015 were up 38%, compared to the same period a year ago and higher than they were in all of 2012. We continued to leverage our One Team approach to better deliver our capital markets capabilities to not only our larger corporate client base, but also to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth class, a value proposition that has been very well received.","Non-interest expense was up over the prior year, largely due to continued strategic investments in CIB. However, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio, which is very accretive to the overall company. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated, and that we have large bank capabilities and talent with a focus on mid corporate and middle-market clients.","Near-term investment banking income will likely decline given the record performance this quarter and normal seasonality, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth outlook for the overall Wholesale Banking segment.","Now moving into the mortgage segment where adjusted net income was stable sequentially and up $24 million over the prior year. Sequential revenue trends were impacted by higher rates in the quarter. However, expenses were flat and our risk profile continued to improve, both of which were important components to maintaining solid overall profitability trends.","Getting into the details, revenues were down year-over-year, driven primarily by $19 million gain on the sale of loans in the prior year. Otherwise the increase and production related income due to a 60% increase in closed loan volume was mostly offset by a decline in servicing income, which occurred because of the higher prepayment activity.","Compared to the prior quarter, revenues declined due to lower production income as a result of the lower refinance activity and reduced all-in gain on sale of margins and lower servicing income. While servicing income decline given prepayment activity and higher hedging costs, the overall servicing portfolio increased sequentially and is up 12% year-over-year largely due to continued portfolio acquisitions.","Application volume declined 10% sequentially though it\u2019s up 31% over the prior year, which will support solid year-over-year growth, rates and production. Refinance activity abated as rates rose in the second quarter. However, purchase activity levels continue to be healthy from applications and closed loans up 20% and 27% respectively compared to the prior year.","Asset quality improved further this quarter as we continued to derisk the portfolio, primarily evidenced by a 42% reduction in non-performing loans as a result of the $110 million transfer of loans to held for sale. Provision expense was again negative this quarter as the pace of asset quality improvement remained strong.","Given the quality of new production, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend positively. Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially and year-over-year because cost saving efforts on lower operating losses have offset growth and production related costs and investments and technology.","In particular, we deployed a new origination system for our retail and consumer direct channels during the quarter. Over time, this new technology will facilitate a faster and simpler loan process for our clients while also improving teammate productivity.","Mortgages continued to be an important financial product for our clients and we are committed to continuing to improve the client experience and stay true to our purpose of lighting the way to financial wellbeing.","So in summary, our company\u2019s performance this quarter reflects its solid progress across key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing capital returns.","Net interest income and margin are beginning to stabilize and our focus on returns will remain a priority. Non-interest income trends are positive and reflective of our consisted strategy to meet more client needs.","In addition, we are mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and to support continued growth investments so that we can deliver on our efficiency goals and provide further long-term value of our clients and our shareholders. As I said earlier, I continue to be very optimistic about our company strategic direction and our ability to execute against those strategies.","So with that, I will turn the call back over to Ankur and we will begin the Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Angelo, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","I was wondering if you could talk to us little bit more about that mixing on the balance sheet. You are obviously continuing to be very aggressive on moving up into those less attractive consumer loans. And you\u2019ve also mentioned just focusing on the ROEs on the commercial side. So how should we think about just loan growth going forward? And could you help us understand when we get to that kind of right bottom in terms of optimization of mix?","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Ken. As we think about our businesses overall, particularly in consumer, what we\u2019re enjoying right now is the ability to grow our direct consumer business at a nice pace and that business generates not only new consumer relationships for us, it generates them at a relatively low cost and relatively high ROA. Along with that, we\u2019re able to move the lower ROA businesses or loans off our balance sheet.","I guess part of your question might relate to the auto securitization that we did in the second quarter, and this is the first time we have entered that market in about eight years or so. And we\u2019re able to take $1 billion of relatively lower ROA, low coupon loans off our balance sheet completely and improve the ROE dramatically in that business while continuing to enjoy the benefits of our strong origination engines and be a partner to our auto dealers.","So this is an area of focus for us for some time. As you know, we have been doing this with government guaranteed loans. We have been doing this with student loans. We are now doing this with indirect auto. So this isn\u2019t a change in philosophy for us. But we\u2019re able to continue moving down the path and grow ROA overall across the company by focusing on business after business after business and improving ROAs across the board.","Bill Rogers","And Ken, it\u2019s Bill. I\u2019d sort of say we also sort of look at the health metrics and defined as sort of pipeline production and commitment growth. And our production virtually in every area, CRE would be an exception and indirect for the reasons we noted, but virtually in every area we\u2019re up sequentially. So production is up, and that\u2019s the important health metric. Pipelines are up. And our commitments are up.","So the things that we look at to see that we have a healthy business and opportunities to increase our total needs met and continue to be healthy. So when we make the pivot, I don\u2019t know, I would say we are always in that matter. And as long as the production and other health metrics stay healthy, I am pretty happy with where we are and generating noninterest income and continuing to improve returns.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And my just follow-up question is just to your point about it being tough to get to that sub-63 efficiency ratio. If the revenue area doesn\u2019t quite turn out, do you pull harder on expense or you just deal with it and continue that longer-term focus to get it down over time just in terms of your balance and urgency? Thanks guys.","Bill Rogers","Yes. We\u2019re always being making those trade-offs. And I think you\u2019ve seen now consistently over the last few years that we got an ability to make those trade-offs, they are hard to do quarter-to-quarter, but they are easier to do over time.","We said at the offset on January 1st that 63 was going to be hard, it\u2019s hard on July 17th, then it will probably be hard till December 31st at midnight. So we are going to continue the diligent approach to match that and continue to improve overall on the commitments we paid on the efficiency side.","Aleem Gillani","I think Ken on that also we set this as a tough target. We knew it was going to be a tough target, but we rather set difficult targets and be challenged in achieving them than set easy targets and just hit them constantly.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning, guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Bill, maybe I can ask a question about the decision to extend the duration on the balance sheet and reduce the rate sensitivity. I know you guys have been one of the more dovish in terms of rate expectations and it looks like that outlook is proving to be correct. But can you just help us understand what the balance sheet is now positioned for in terms of rate expectations and do you see any further changes coming to the swap portfolio?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I will turn it to Aleem, but I will sort of start with. I think we are fundamentally in sort of the same zone we\u2019ve always talked about. And maybe I will let Aleem go into some more of the details.","Aleem Gillani","All right. To give you a couple of seconds of context, the general philosophy, we don\u2019t make big bets on rates. If you think back a few years ago, we\u2019re sort of modestly liability sensitive as rates were coming down. Today, we are modestly asset sensitive as we think rates are going up. And that\u2019s generally the way we run the overall balance sheet.","Our expectation today, which is sort of unchanged from the fall of 2014, is that there will be a rate hike around the end of this year and the rate rise will overall be deliberately paced after that for the first year or two. If you look at the swap books specifically and you think about the decline in income in the swap book, the largest driver of the decline there hasn\u2019t been declining notionals. We have been generally consistently in the size of the book.","But it\u2019s simply the effect of the lower rate environment as the old swap coupons with higher rates are rolling off and we are putting new ones on at lower coupons. So overall you are right, we have been generally dovish on rates. We do expect that overall rate hike will be deliberately paced and I think [Cherry Allen] [ph] confirmed that view earlier this week. So we\u2019re continuing to manage the balance sheet in that context to mitigate the risk that we have as a company to lower for longer and to prevent the balance sheet risk profile from becoming too asset sensitive too quickly.","Ryan Nash","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe I could just ask a quick one on expenses, which were up seasonally. I was wondering how much of the increase was driven by performance and vendors. I know you mentioned it was the majority of it versus core inflation. When I look on past years, we did see a nice step-down in the back half of the year in cost. I was wondering if we should expect to see a similar type of step-down for 2015.","Bill Rogers","Yes. We did get some of that step-down on compensation Ryan that did show up. Against that, also remember some of the increase quarter-on-quarter was due to the discrete that we had in Q1, the recognition of the gain on affordable housing, but some of the increase certainly was an increase in comp and that break that up into two pieces. One piece was April 1 standard merit increase date and that showed up. And then part two is the increase due to higher performance and the accrual for higher incentives this year as the result of the dramatic increase we saw in fee income.","As you know, we are overall focused not as much on the expense number itself, but much more so on the efficiency ratio and continuing to improve the efficiency of the company overall. So I am actually pretty pleased that we got enough of an increase in revenue that despite the increase in expense we\u2019re able to bring the efficiency ratio down some more.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. So in other way, I mean, what you have seen is the pattern on the latter half of the year as the efficiency ratio coming down and obviously the fact that we\u2019re above 63 now, we want to be below 63 that would be our expectation as we said here today.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Erika.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","The first question, as we also think about your rate sensitivity heading into next year, could you give us a sense in a deliberate increase in rates slowly paced increase in rates? How do you expect the past-through from both the pace and magnitude perspective in terms of your deposit data? And do you think that there is a shift change in terms of LCR essentially saying retail deposits are better than everything else? Is that a factor that we should take into account that could be a game changer relative to the last time the Fed raised rates?","Bill Rogers","Yes, Erika, there certainly appear to be lots of differing views on this issue all over the industry. And as you know, people are making the very reasonable and logical arguments for past at both ends of that spectrum. It\u2019s going to be difficult to know how this plays out I think for several years before we see exactly what happens.","But if you look at where we are, I think we fall sort of somewhere near the middle view overall. With the industry overall today enjoying this abundance of deposits and liquidity, it does seem reasonable to us to assume the deposits rates on the way up will lag a little bit.","If you go back and look at history and the last 2004-2006 rate cycle, our own experience there was that our data range was between 20% and 50%, and that range is sort of differing products, differing products generated a range like that.","As we look at this next rate cycle, a slow and deliberate move up would argue along with liquidity for us -- for deposit betas to be, perhaps, toward the bottom end of that, but that\u2019s not necessarily what we're assuming.","We're taking a more conservative view than that and as we model out different scenarios, we\u2019re tending to be a little bit mote conservative and modeling in ALCO, perhaps, toward the top end of that range, which I think is somewhat sort of in the middle of where the industry is overall.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. And I think for, we spend a lot of time on this topic as you might imagine in our ALCO committee and among our executive team and but for our frontline team mates, we\u2019re pretty clear. I mean, we want more deposits of high value and we want them better cross sold.","And I think you can really see that in the last couple years in our portfolio and I think, overtime that\u2019s the best way we can impact sort of what is an uncertain deposit beta future.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up to that and a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question about remixing the balance sheet, the consumer direct business that you talk about, you highlighted in the past two calls, is that the LightStream business and if so, can you give us a sense in terms of how much -- in terms of contribution to growth do you see in your budget and what the credit in your characteristics are of typical LightStream borrower and can you get their deposits, have you been successful in able to get those deposits as well?","Bill Rogers","Erika, that\u2019s a lot of questions in there.","Erika Najarian","Sorry. I -- just give us, I was trying to sneak them all in, I am sorry. ","Bill Rogers","We\u2019ve got them cataloged.","Aleem Gillani","When you think about those businesses, our digital and online businesses, the credit characteristics are exceedingly good. We are running in FICO terms generally north of 700. And our history so far, well, let me say that, well, north of 700. And our history so far on those businesses in terms of charge-offs is exceedingly good. Total charge-offs in that business so far this year are less than a $1 million.","And current 30-day plus delinquency in LightStream are also less than a $1 million. So it\u2019s exceedingly good credit quality. The growth rate is very good. The expense of generating those loans given the digital platform tends to be lower, so the ROAs tend to be higher there.","Given that LightStream is a national platform. It\u2019s more difficult for us to generate deposit businesses from those clients. But we\u2019ve been able to get some and we're very focused on continuing to be more client needs driven by originations wherever they are across our platform.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. And just to be clear on sort of the total direct and it is almost in thirds, but its pretty close. It\u2019s really LightStream, GreenSky and our credit card business. So and they all have similar kind of characteristics that Aleem was talking about, certainly high FICO score, obviously, the credit cards much more fully cross-sold from a [indiscernible] standpoint. So it\u2019s really a several different categories of high credit quality, better yield and client-oriented assets that have the opportunity for future cross-sale.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I have a question on the deposit growth and how you utilized it this quarter. So you, as indicated, had some nice deposit growth in the quarter. It looks like you used it to pay down some of the short-term borrowings and I was wondering why you chose to do that, as opposed to utilize it in potentially paying down some of the higher cost debt?","Aleem Gillani","Yeah. Actually, but we did paid, use it to pay down long-term debt. I think, quarter-over-quarter if you take a look our long-term debt is down about $3 billion and our short-term debt is about a -- is up about a $1.5 billion.","Betsy Graseck","Right.","Aleem Gillani","So generally we did use it to pay-off long-term higher cost debt and restructured that a little bit, which will help NIM going forward.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And plans to continue that\u2026","Aleem Gillani","To the extent\u2026","Betsy Graseck","\u2026 as opposed, yeah.","Aleem Gillani","\u2026 that we continue to get great deposit growth, our first use of cash is always loans. So we just love to do more client business and underlying loans first and to the extent that we need cash for other things we might use it for example to grow HQLA. But paying off debt and focusing on growing NIM, obviously, is going to be high on our priority list.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Okay. And then just on the swap income book, would you consider increasing the size in the event that we get a slower pace of uplift in the fed funds?","Bill Rogers","Well, it\u2019s really -- is going to depend on a lot of things then, right. What the forward curve looks like at that time? Where the value looks like at that time? What our overall loan to deposit ratio and floating rate to fixed rate book looks like at that time? So it\u2019s on the table. But the decision on whether to do it will really be taken by our ALCO based on a whole host of current events.","Betsy Graseck","All right. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Just back to expenses really quick, I know -- again back to that 63% number. In terms of the difficulty in getting there, how much of that is rate because it sounds like you said you weren\u2019t really betting on rates anyway, so what is it that really drove the shortfall in your eyes? Is it other related margin pressures or sluggish pickup in loan growth, what really contributed to that?","Bill Rogers","John, let me sort of start that. We don\u2019t perceive we had a shortfall, so the 63 is the full year goal as we indicated earlier. This tends to have some seasonality attached to it. You look at the last couple of years. The last two quarters tend to be lower on the efficiency ratio side. So, we are not perceiving or indicating, or highlighting a shortfall. We're just talking about it all. We have said earlier, we don't anticipate a rate increase impact to our efficiency ratio target. I think that keeps the discipline tight for us internally.","So it\u2019s sort of a no excuses commitment that we make to ourselves and we don't look to exogenous factors to get it. We've got to sort of do it internally within our business. So, I think just really all we were trying to indicate is that it is hard and that we have a lot of things that we have to do. We have commitments that we have to make and we have got execution that we have got to make sure that we accomplish.","I think I\u2019ve indicated before, every single one of our lines of businesses have a short-term and a long-term efficiency ratio target. And they have specific initiatives that they have to undertake against those. And I\u2019m sort of looking around the rooms here in the eyes of all of them and they know it is hard. But I don\u2019t want you to think that we think we are behind.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. That\u2019s fair. And then on the competitive commentary that you provided, sorry if you already elaborated on it, but on the commercial side, we are seeing a lot of your peer banks that are starting to step to the sidelines in terms of some of the most competitive mid-market commercial type of lending. Are you seeing competitive pressures that are keeping you out of that space as well?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I think it always depends on how you define the space. Everybody sort of defines corporate mid-market in different ways. If we sort of talk about our commercial market, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re stepping away from anything. I mean, like we\u2019re sort of stepping into the opportunities. If we talk about the upper end of large corporate, or maybe seeing some leverage that\u2019s reaching some new thin air, yeah, I think there are things that we\u2019re stepping away from in terms of a structural leverage kind of standpoint but we see lots of opportunities. So, we still see lots of things that we can stay involved in. The market, I guess, particularly in our markets and then the businesses that we\u2019re in, I guess was, is and will be continue to be competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Could you elaborate more on investment banking? I look at the four largest banks that reported so far this quarter. Traditional investment banking is kind of flat or tiny a bit quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. If I look at total capital markets, it\u2019s down. I know you look at SunTrust, which is up by half linked quarter and by a fifth year-over-year. So the question is how are you doing that? Are you taking on more risk? Is it because maybe your category includes syndicated finance? Maybe that\u2019s not apples-to-apples. Or just can you just give us more transparency on what's underneath that investment banking line item?","Aleem Gillani","Yeah. Sure, Mike. And the good news is it is not one thing. So, we\u2019re hitting on a lot of cylinders. Syndication was clearly up, high-yield bond origination clearly up, investment-grade bond origination up, equity offerings and M&A both up significantly.","So for us, I think it\u2019s just an execution, continued execution of the strategy that we've been on now for multi, multi years. It\u2019s mainly a mid-market business. For us, we still operate in a mid-market zone.","I mean that\u2019s how we build this business. And I think it maybe a good harbinger of positive development, that, that kind of activity in that market is getting better, particularly in the areas of M&A and syndications.","Mike Mayo","So of the $145 million this quarter, I mean just roughly, how much is syndications versus some of the other areas?","Aleem Gillani","Mike, syndication is about third of that in terms of total revenue.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And the other two thirds just in a broad brush?","Aleem Gillani","Yeah. That would be investment grade bonds, high yield bonds, M&A and equity offerings would be the majority of the remainder.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And lastly, you said you putting on new C&I loans yields at lower yields than the existing. How do you consider pricing your commercial loans in the context of having the capital market business like you have?","Aleem Gillani","It\u2019s clearly part of our calculus. Whenever we look at new business or new clients. part of our philosophy is always we want to be a relevant supplier for that client. So to be relevant that\u2019s not necessarily just lending the money. It\u2019s understanding their entire business, understanding their needs, and being there as in -- as a strategic advisor to them to help them to grow their business.","And in that context, we\u2019re very aware of how our investment banking and capital market business might be able to help them do that. And we make them aware of that and we hope that there is a good synergy there.","Bill Rogers","Yes, Mike. I mean every new commitment of any size has got a go through in ROA, ROE and RAROC lens. All of which are very disciplined and we hold our teammates accountable for achieving those.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about high-to-low transaction processing on checking accounts. Do you have any thoughts on whether you are going to be moving more into line with other banks in the industry and discontinuing that at some points over the next few quarters and years?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I\u2019m going to apologize I had a hard time hearing your question, but I\u2019m sure, it was high-to-low related. So let me\u2026","Geoffrey Elliott","It was. Are you going to move more into line with other banks over the next few quarters and years?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. So couple of comments to clarify the statements that we\u2019ve made in the past as we currently are high to low. But we have some very significant differences that we process deposit before debits. We have limits on OD numbers and we have a no small OD type policy. So those are important sort of in context. Now that been said what we have said is that we are going to transition to moreover time based system.","We are going to be doing that through 2016. So we are doing right now a lot of client research. We are doing a lot of product research. We are modeling lots of different activities. So sometime in the later half of 2016, we\u2019ll be in sort of implementation mode. So I think the financial impact yet to be determined but clearly predicate on some of the other things I said. We won\u2019t start feeling that probably until full year \u201817.","Geoffrey Elliott","And can you give any kind of range at all around what the financial impact could be once we get into 2017?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I don\u2019t want to do that yet, because we really got to finish the modeling process. We remember sort of ODs as a total or about 3% of our total revenue base. This would only impact a portion of that. So this is not a substantial change but we\u2019ve really got to finish the modeling part and determine what client response will be and making sure that we are responsive to clients. So sometime later, we\u2019ll be able to quantify that I think a little more specifically. But for now we are not viewing this as given away we currently process, doing this as a major, major shift from a revenue perspective.","Ankur Vyas","Angela, we have a time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of follow-ups. Aleem on the mortgage outlook, how are you thinking about that? I mean the production revenues were down a little bit quarter-over-quarter. I think that was partly due to lower gain on sale, but also I think you had some MSR, higher MSR hit in the servicing income. How are you thinking about mortgage revenue over the next couple of quarters?","Bill Rogers","Yes. Thanks, Matt. As we think about our patterns in the mortgage business, as rates have moved up as and I look forward to Q3, I would probably think about the refi business, the refi activity continuing to decline and continuing that pattern that we saw in Q2.","But I would think that purchase activity will continue to remain strong sort of within seasonal patterns. So perhaps, this is a stronger Q3, followed by slower Q4. And in our markets, the economies are doing well, unemployment is down, GDP is up, and so the purchase business I think there is looking pretty good.","In terms of MSR and servicing, Q2 was a little bit difficult for us because of all of the rate volatility that we had in Q2. You recall the way you normally see rate volatility affecting us is in a particularly volatile quarter. Our servicing income is generally down. And if rates are relatively stable, our servicing income is generally up.","So looking forward to Q3, I was thinking about refi activity being down, purchase activity remaining strong, and the MSR or servicing income being partially contingent on rate volatility.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. I think all things being equal, I mean I think 2015 will certainly be better than 2014, somewhat balance if you want to sort of try to net all that out as you look forward. And particularly in our markets, I mean we are seeing good housing recovery, we are seeing good purchase activity, and we are seeing a very good improvement. And I think the most important is the job creation. So we feel good about the purchase activity, while transition is lame settle have a seasonal component to it, but '15 will be better on balance than '14.","Matt Burnell","Okay. That\u2019s helpful color. And then for my follow-up. I guess I just want to follow up on Mike\u2019s train of thought in terms of the capital markets business. You have mentioned that obviously that\u2019s a sort of a client focus business. You want to be a strategic advisor to your customers. I want to put some numbers to that. I mean, can you demonstrate or show sort of what the percentage of customers that you're doing capital markets activity for now versus, let\u2019s say two years ago and sort of what the momentum in that metric might be?","Aleem Gillani","Matt, I don\u2019t know if we got that exactly metric, but maybe another way of showing the momentum and our success in becoming a strategic partner to our clients is actually the line of business revenue out of our corporate and investment banking unit. And if you look at that over time, go back to the start of 2014 that was around 90 million.","And as you saw this quarter was around 145 million. So that about of 50% increase in revenue coming out of that business, which might be a good indicator for you as to our success in meeting client needs, not just in terms of broadening and covering more clients but getting deeper with the clients we have.","Bill Rogers","Yes. I mean, if you just try to put some numbers around sort of where we\u2019re moving, I mean we\u2019re four times more left lead, 44 times more joint bookrunner or one time more left lead on investment grade, 27 times more joint bookrunner. So these are good, I mean big numbers. I mean, we have lots of penetration not only within the client base but for those clients we are moving to the left side.","Ankur Vyas","Angela, this concludes our call.

I'll begin today's call with some brief comments about the quarter and then we'll pass it over to Aleem to provide more detail on the results and then I'll come back. ","I'm going to start today on Slide 3, which provides a summary of the major drivers for our performance. Net income was $152 million for the quarter or $0.28 a share. Full year EPS was $1.09 and up meaningfully from the prior year. While we generated good core business momentum, and that was building throughout the year, some of that progress is being masked by legacy mortgage issues that continue to impact results. ","Our favorable loan and deposit, both growth and mix trends, continued this quarter. Performing loans were up a solid 4%, and that is net of our continued efforts to reduce our exposure to higher-risk loans. At the same time, we saw strong DDA growth over the last quarter and last year. Over the course of the last few years, strong deposit growth has outstripped loan growth, causing our loan-to-deposit ratio to decline, though the current momentum on the loan side is going to allow us to better utilize the deposits and thus bring the ratio more back in the line. ","While the net interest margin was down slightly, improved deposit mix, pricing discipline and loan growth drove an absolute increase in net interest income. Conversely, fee income declined from last quarter due to lower debit interchange revenues and an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. We're going to provide much more detail on mortgage repurchases later in this call. ","Total expenses were down modestly from the prior quarter, but we've made excellent progress on our PPG program this quarter, hitting 25% of our annualized target by year end and putting us firmly on track to remove $300 million from our expense base by year end 2013. From a credit quality perspective, we continued to see improvement across all primary credit metrics. Most notably, nonperforming loans were down 10%, sequentially. Lastly, we generated positive capital growth, and our capital ratios remained strong and well in excess of current and proposed regulatory requirements. ","Now that sums up the quarter from a very, very high level. I'm going to turn it over to Aleem. He's going to give you some more details. And then, as I said, I'll come back and sum up a bit. Aleem?","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate it's been a busy week for you, so thank you for choosing to join us this morning. We had several large items impact our results this quarter, some positively and some negatively. So before getting too deep into our results, let's get grounded in these. ","As we do each quarter, we spelled out certain adjustment items in our appendix. This is done to provide you clarity on items affecting our noninterest income and expense trends that are nonrecurring or non-core. The 3 largest such items from the fourth quarter are shown at the top of Slide 4. ","First, we wrote down the value of our MSR by $38 million due to the expected increased prepayment speeds associated with HARP 2.0. While this is an upfront financial cost of the program, we do expect to realize future benefits from HARP-related refinance activity. ","Second and per our November 8-K filing, we made the decision to freeze our defined benefit pension plan. Concurrent with the freeze, we also made a onetime contribution to our longer-tenured teammates' 401(k) accounts. The net impact of these 2 items resulted in a fourth quarter gain of $60 million. We also recorded $27 million in severance-related expenses associated with our Playbook for Profitable Growth or PPG Expense Program. This was due to progress that we made on the implementation and design of the program during the fourth quarter. This quarter's accrual reflects what we currently believe to be the majority of the severance costs to be incurred over the life of the program. ","Two other notable items this quarter are shown at the bottom of the slide. As we previously communicated, we observed an elevated level of mortgage repurchase demands during the fourth quarter. These demands, together with an increase to our mortgage repurchase reserve, led to a $215 million mortgage repurchase provision, which is up by $98 million from the third quarter. We'll discuss this in greater detail in a few minutes. And lastly, we had an approximate $50 million reduction in card fees due to the impact of debit interchange regulations that became effective during the fourth quarter. ","One item you don't see on this slide is an accrual for a mortgage servicing settlement with the state's Attorneys General. Like several other servicers, we have very recently commenced discussions regarding such an event. However, this dialogue is in the very preliminary stages, so we do not yet have a reasonable estimate of the amount, and no accrual for the potential financial impact has been recorded in our financial results. As discussions progress over the next few weeks, we expect to provide an update on this matter in our 10-K. ","With these items as a backdrop, please turn to Slide 5 for a review of the summary income statement. Net income to common shareholders was $152 million this quarter or $0.28 per share. This compares with $0.39 per share last quarter and $0.23 per share for the fourth quarter of last year. The $0.11 sequential quarter decline was the result of lower noninterest income primarily due to the impact of 3 items I mentioned on the previous slide: The increased mortgage repurchase provision, lower debit interchange revenue and the HARP-related MSR adjustment. These more than offset an increase in net interest income, a lower provision and a modest expense decline. ","$0.05 EPS increase from the fourth quarter of 2010 was driven by higher net interest income, a lower provision and the elimination of the TARP preferred dividends. These were partially offset by the decline in fee income for mortgages and debit cards. ","For the full year, we reported EPS of $1.09, up meaningfully from the net loss of $0.18 reported in 2010. This was driven by a 4% increase in net interest income, a significant reduction in the loan loss provision due to improved credit quality and the elimination of TARP dividends beginning in the second quarter of 2011.  ","Let's now delve deeper into each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 6. Fourth quarter net interest income increased sequentially by $31 million or 2%. This was due to an increase in interest income resulting from strong loan growth, together with a decline in interest expense due to the continuation of the favorable deposit mix and pricing trends as well as a reduction in long-term debt. Consistent with our prior guidance, the net interest margin declined by 3 basis points, the result of lower-earning asset yields. We expect that we'll see another 3- to 5-basis-point margin decline in the first quarter, also attributable to lower yields. ","Relative to the prior year, fourth quarter net interest income increased by $30 million or 2%. This was driven by a lower interest expense, which was attributable to 22% average DDA growth, a 20-basis-point reduction in deposit rates paid and a $2 billion reduction in average long-term debt. Similar factors also drove full year net interest income growth of over $200 million or 4%. ","Turning to noninterest income. On a reported basis, noninterest income declined by $180 million from the third quarter. This was attributable to an increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, the HARP 2.0 MSR valuation adjustments, the impact of debit interchange regulation and lower valuation gains on the company's fair value debt. On an adjusted basis, noninterest income declined sequentially by $101 million due to the $98 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision and a $42 million decline in card fees. Partially offsetting this was a strong quarter for Investment Banking, driven by higher syndicated finance revenue. ","Trading income also increased as market conditions were more favorable than those in the third quarter, and core mortgage production was also strong, with volume and gain-on-sale margins remaining at healthy levels. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2010, fee income declined by $185 million, again, primarily due to the mortgage repurchase provision and card fees. ","Moving to Slide 8. You see in the top left portion of this slide that we received $636 million in demands this quarter, up by almost $200 million from the last quarter. The increase was entirely due to agency-related demands, most notably from 2007 vintage Fannie Mae loans. Overall, the reasons for the demands are similar to those in previous quarters, such as borrower misrepresentation or issues with the prices. ","The demands that we've received have been more concentrated in loans that have already been through the foreclosure process. However, we have recently noticed some change in the pattern of requests relative to their delinquency status. The more recent requests for full loan files, which are a precursor for future demands, have been more skewed toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure. This suggests to us that the agencies are working through the backlog of demands from prior years, which indicate that the demand increase in Q4 could be an acceleration of timing rather than growth in the overall population. ","The top right part of this page shows pending demands increased from $490 million to $590 million. This was due to the increase in current quarter demands. You'll note that due to our high level of loss resolution this quarter, the pending population at quarter end was actually below the amount of current quarter demands. ","Charge-offs for the quarter were $177 million, up by over $40 million from Q3, due to the high level of demand resolution activities. A provision of $215 million exceeded charge-offs, resulting in an increase to the mortgage repurchase reserve of $38 million. We believe this higher reserve level is appropriate in light of the recent increase in demands. The bottom right portion of the slide reflects originations, demands activity and losses to date for the 2005 to 2011 vintages. ","Now let's turn to Slide 9, where we hone in on similar data for the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for about 85% of all demands and 90% of losses to date. This slide shares some new disclosures that we hope will provide you with focused information on these 3 highest loss vintages. Some additional information on each of these individual vintages is also included in the appendix. ","On the left side of the page, you see that we originated and sold loans with $120 billion in unpaid principal balance or UPB. This includes $99 billion in agency loans and $21 billion of private label. You'll also see some historical information on delinquencies, the repurchase rate and loss severity. The right-hand side of the page shows our loss experienced to date from the 2006 to 2008 vintages. I'll walk you through this framework as it's a useful one, not only for understanding our losses to date, but also for estimating future losses. ","Starting at the top, you see the $120 billion in loans originated and sold. When you multiply that by the 17.7% of loans that have ever gone 120 days past due, you arrive at a total ever 120 days past due delinquent amount of $21.2 billion. This is relevant as the vast majority of demands have come from this population of loans. ","To date, demands received on 2006 to 2008 vintages have equaled 20.9% of this delinquent population or $4.4 billion in total demands. $0.5 billion of those demands are still pending, and $3.9 billion in demands have been resolved. The repurchase rate on this $3.9 billion has been 58% or $2.3 billion in total repurchases. At a severity rate of 47%, this has resulted in $1.1 billion in losses recognized to date. This loss figure, taken together with our current reserve for these vintages, has led to a $1.3 billion income statement impact to date for these 2006 to 2008 vintages. The 4 key variables in this framework are the delinquency rate, the request rate, the repurchase rate and loss severity. ","Let's focus on the delinquency and request rates first. Repurchase requests received to date have had an inverse correlation to the amount of time between origination and default. The shorter the timeframe between origination and default, the greater the request rate. And the longer the timeframe, the less likely it is that a request will be received. There has also been a positive correlation between the current loan-to-value ratio and the request rates. The higher the current LTV, the higher the request rate and vice versa. ","The preponderance of demands received has come from loans that went delinquent within the first 36 months after origination. If this pattern continues and investor selection criteria do not change, it suggests that the pool of delinquent loans from which we'll receive demands should be stabilizing given that any performing loan from the 2006 to 2008 vintages is now past this 3-year mark. ","The lifetime request rate is likely to increase somewhat as it would be reasonable to expect new demands from this delinquent population of loans. Current LTV is one predictive variable for the potential magnitude of the increase. If housing values generally continue to decline, this could indicate the potential for a continuation of elevated request levels. However, as I noted previously, we've been witnessing some patterns in demands in full file requests, which suggest that the backlog of demands from prior years could be thinning. Factors that point to a more modest increase in the request rate are the passage of time, the shift in full file requests from later stage foreclosed loans to earlier stage default status and the fact that demands can only reasonably be gauged [ph] on that population of loans that did not meet underwriting guidelines. ","  ","With respect to the other 2 variables, the repurchase rate on these 3 vintages has been fairly consistent in the 56% to 58% range, while the severity rate in the last 12 months has been about 55%, which is higher than the 47% lifetime severity. This increase is due to the impact that declining home values have had on severity as well as the higher proportion of demands coming from the 2007 vintage, which was the peak of the housing market. ","In conclusion, while mortgage repurchase demands remain difficult to predict, we do expect them to remain elevated in the coming quarters. However, if the assumptions that lead us to believe why we're seeing an acceleration of demands prove correct, then we would expect the earnings impact associated with this issue to lessen during the second half of 2012. ","Let's move on to Slide 10 for a discussion of noninterest expenses. Expenses declined by $13 million from the third quarter. This was driven by a $126 million decline in employee compensation and benefits. Roughly half of that was due to the pension curtailment net of the 401(k) contribution. The balance was largely driven by a year end reduction to incentive plans based upon the company's full year financial performance. So we will obviously see an increase in this line item next quarter as the pension gain is nonrecurring, compensation plans will reset for the new year, and we'll have the usual seasonal increase in FICA and other benefits. ","Partially offsetting this quarter's total expense decline were increases in credit and collections expense due primarily to seasonal tax and insurance payments on nonperforming mortgages, higher operating losses associated with specific legal accruals and a seasonal increase in marketing. Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, reported expenses were stable. Employee compensation declined, while operating losses and credit and collections expenses increased. ","On to the balance sheet, beginning with loan trends on Slide 11. Our loan performance growth was strong with average performing loans increasing by over $4 billion or 4% from the third quarter. Most notable was the $2.2 billion or almost 5% increase in C&I loans. Growth here was largely driven by our larger corporate borrowers, with our Corporate and Investment Banking line of business accounting for $1.7 billion of the increase. Growth came across most industry verticals, with healthcare and energy contributing the most. Our asset-backed commercial paper conduit also helped drive the increase as did asset-based lending. ","The Diversified Commercial line of business also demonstrated growth, with outstanding up about $0.5 billion, driven by a modest increase in utilization rates. Residential loans increased by about $700 million entirely due to government-guaranteed mortgages. We added to this portfolio during the quarter as we continued to make progress on diversifying and de-risking the overall balance sheet. ","Consumer loans also increased, up $1.6 billion or about 9.5%. Growth came across all categories, with government-guaranteed student loans being the largest driver, up $1.2 billion due to portfolio acquisitions. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up $5.5 billion or 5%. C&I grew more than $4.5 billion or over 10%, while consumer loans increased over $3.5 billion or almost 25%. ","Concurrent with the growth in these targeted categories and as part of our loan portfolio diversification strategy, we decreased our exposure to other asset classes. The resulting de-risking of the portfolio is shown on Slide 12. ","Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by over $13 billion or more than 55% over the past 3 years. At the same time, government-guaranteed loans increased by over $11 billion. We've essentially replaced loans that were higher risk with those that are guaranteed. This double de-risking has driven a meaningful improvement in our risk profile. ","The decline in the higher risk balances continued last quarter, falling by another $0.5 billion. As expected, the pace of dollar decline moderated somewhat during the second half of the year, which is a function of the overall balances reaching lower levels. Relative to the prior year, higher risk balances declined by almost $3 billion or more than 20%. Commercial construction was the largest driver, down $1.3 billion or more than 50%. Higher-risk mortgages and home equity also declined by approximately $800 million each. ","Overall, we're pleased with the progress that we've -- that we're making in our loan portfolio diversification strategy. We've been successful both in growing targeted commercial and consumer categories as well as in reducing our exposure to certain residential and construction categories. Our strategy to purchase government-guaranteed loans has performed well as a bridge during a time of low economic growth. And if organic loan growth continues in the coming quarters, we expect slower growth in this category. ","As for deposit performance, fourth quarter saw a continuation of favorable deposit growth and mix trends. Average client deposits increased by $2.1 billion or 1.7%. This growth was again driven by lower cost deposits, most notably DDA, which increased by more than $2 billion or almost 7%. NOW accounts also increased, while higher-cost time deposits continued their decline, falling by about $800 million or more than 4%. ","Story from the prior year is similar. Client deposits grew by $5.4 billion or 4.5%. Lower-cost deposits led the way, up over 8%, with DDA, the largest driver, increasing by more than $6 billion or over 20%. And currently, higher-cost time deposits declined by almost $3 billion. These favorable deposit trends have been the major driver of our higher levels of net interest income and the year-over-year increase in NIM. ","Moving on to credit quality on Slide 14. Primary credit metrics continue to trend favorably this quarter. The only anomaly is the increase in the total delinquency ratio, which you see on the top left graph. This was due to the purchase of government-guaranteed student loan portfolios. That asset class has higher delinquency rates, although the true loss exposure is very low due to the government guarantee. ","Delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, continue to trend lower, down 2 basis points, driven by improvements in nonguaranteed mortgages and home equity. Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans declined by 10% each, while net charge-offs fell modestly, lower by 4%. We'll look further at the underlying trends in both of these metrics momentarily. ","In the light of the continued credit quality improvement, the allowance fell by about $140 million. The ratio of the allowance to loans declined on a reported basis by 21 basis points to 2.01% with this quarter's growth in loans contributing an 8-basis-point decline -- an 8 basis -- contributing 8 basis points to the decrease. When excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the calculation, the allowance was 2.27% of loans at the end of the quarter or about 25 basis points higher than it was on a reported basis. Overall, we're pleased with the continued improvements in the quality of the balance sheet. ","Slide 15 provides some additional detail on nonperforming loan and net charge-off trends. Nonperforming loans declined by 10% on a sequential quarter basis. This marks the 10th consecutive quarter of lower nonperforming loans. Similar to recent quarterly trends, commercial loans were the largest driver, down by $279 million or 23%, with notable decreases across each of the commercial loan categories. Residential nonperforming loans also decreased, driven by improvements in residential construction and nonguaranteed mortgages. ","Net charge-offs improved sequentially, lower by 4% from the third quarter level. This improvement was driven by commercial construction loans, partially offset by a $23 million increase in residential loans. Relative to the prior year, nonperforming loans were down by $1.2 billion or almost 30%. Commercial construction, C&I and nonguaranteed mortgages were the largest drivers of the decline, though every loan category improved. ","Fourth quarter net charge-offs declined by $150 million or almost 25% from the prior year. Declines were most evident in nonguaranteed mortgages, commercial construction, C&I and home equity. For the full year, net charge-offs declined by over $800 million or about 30%, with residential loans being the largest driver. As we look to the first quarter of 2012, we again expect to see a further decline in NPLs, with net charge-offs relatively stable to modestly down. ","Slide 16 shows trends in our capital metrics, beginning with Tier 1 common at the top left of the page. Tier 1 common capital continued its higher trend this quarter, up by about $100 million, as a result of retained earnings. The estimated Tier 1 common ratio ended 2011 at a healthy level of 9.25%. The modest decline from the third quarter was due to strong loan growth generating additional risk-weighted assets. ","Tier 1 capital also increased, while the Tier 1 ratio was estimated to decline from the third quarter due to risk-weighted asset growth as well as continued modest reductions in our outstanding trust preferred securities. You may note that over the course of the year, we were able to reduce our outstanding TruPS by almost $400 million. Both the Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios continue to be well above both Basel I and Basel III regulatory requirements. ","The tangible common equity ratio declined by 30 basis points due to lower accumulated other comprehensive income, which was primarily the result of actuarial adjustments to our pension as well as higher assets. The AOCI decline, partially offset by this quarter's retained earnings, is what led to the 1% decline in tangible book value per share, which ended the quarter at $25.33. ","Let's turn to Slide 17 for a discussion of our PPG Expense Program. We previously outlined this program for you. And as Bill stated earlier, we have made some very good early progress toward achieving our $300 million goal. By the end of the year, we have achieved $75 million in annualized savings from our cost base or about $18 million per quarter. ","PPG is comprised of 3 primary areas of opportunity: Strategic supply management, consumer bank efficiencies and operations and staff support. These opportunities span the entire organization, and every teammate is involved in delivering expense savings and meeting our goal. ","On this slide, you can see that we have provided the major initiatives within each category and our progress against them. As we're still relatively early in the process, some initiatives are still in the planning phase, while others are starting to deliver real-time expense savings. ","Strategic supply management represents our largest opportunity, and the savings to date are coming from our negotiations with vendors as well as demand management. On the vendor side, we've commenced initiatives to secure even more competitive pricing. At the same time, we're proactively further managing down our own demand. For instance, we've reduced demands for print services, market data tools, travel and the like. While none of these, individually, are overly significant, in the aggregate, they add up, and these types of initiatives have the added benefit of getting all of our teammates engaged to help improve performance for our shareholders. ","Moving to consumer bank efficiencies. Savings to date here have come entirely from our sales and service productivity initiatives. We've made these changes in response to changing client behavior and preferences. Clients' willingness and desire to utilize self-service channels has increased, so we made numerous investments over the past few years in client-facing technology such as mobile and ATM enhancements. ","The adoption rates of these self-service channels has been high, which has shifted transaction volume out of the branch. This is allowing us to refine our branch network and staffing models. Specifically, we have reduced our branch staffing levels primarily through attrition as we transition into a new staffing model. This model will be more efficient, and we believe it will enable us to maintain our high levels of client satisfaction and loyalty. ","Operations and staff support is the other main category of savings. Savings realized to date have been achieved largely through our consolidations and shared services initiatives. We've already made strategic consolidations in our finance and marketing groups, which are driving the current savings, and we'll also be making changes in other functional areas. As our PPG Expense Program progresses, we'll continue to provide status updates to you along with the savings that are being realized. ","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. We're pleased with the progress we've made on our expense saving program. As Aleem stated, we got off to a fast start in 2011, and you can expect to see us move steadily towards our targets in 2012 and '13. Let me assure you this has my, Aleem and the company's full attention. ","Now by now, you are familiar with our strategic priorities to drive higher profitability from a more diversified platform. In addition to our efforts to improve the expense efficiency, we're also focused on growing consumer market and wallet share, diversifying the loan portfolio and optimizing our business mix, and we've had some real successes against these initiatives in 2011 and more importantly, have positive momentum headed into 2012. ","I'm going to spend a few minutes just today highlighting some of the key underlying fundamentals in each of our lines of businesses to give you a perspective on core performance. In spite of regulatory headwinds, we've made great strides in our efforts to grow consumer market and wallet share. The core of these initiatives show up on our retail line of business and is a testament to our investments in improving client loyalty. ","In 2011, despite all the product changes, we were able to expand our primary relationships over the prior year. Building on client loyalty as the foundation, we also significantly expanded our product penetration per relationship, and this was done particularly well in the fourth quarter. From an overall deposit market share perspective, despite increased competition, we have increased share in 8 of our 10 largest MSAs. And on the lending side, we're delivering strong performance with both consumer direct and indirect loans, up marketably over last year. ","On a very short period of time, we've become an industry leader in our market in service quality and client loyalty. Our goal now is to better monetize this position via increased momentum and acquisition, retention and significant improvement in relationship expansion, and I'm pleased to say they're all showing a positive trajectory. ","Our Wealth and Investment Management net income was up 16% over last year, with retail investment income generating an impressive growth rate of 12%. Trust income was also up significantly over last year, and we drove the revenue of this line of business while keeping the expenses stable. An improving market can only add additional leverage. ","Our Corporate and Investment Banking business delivered record revenue and net income results in 2011, evidence that our relationship-based business model is working and being embraced by the market. On the asset side, loans were up an impressive 25%. Further, we moved up in most lead table rankings, and we're simply winning more lead left mandates. The business is growing the top line, adding and expanding relationships and investing in talent, all while operating with a close eye on efficiency. ","Our Diversified Commercial Banking line of business delivered solid growth in both net interest and fee income with total revenue up 9% and net income up 33% over last year. Loans grew steadily throughout the year, coupled with strong growth in primary relationships, which helped drive performance. The efficiency ratio for this line of business is also very attractive. ","Growing CIB and Diversified Commercial Banking are key elements of our strategy to optimize our business mix, and they will be accretive to our efficiency story. I'll also point out that credit quality held up very well in both businesses on a relative basis throughout the cycle, and both had low loss rates in 2011. Overall, I'm pleased with the progress that we've made here and the potential for future growth. ","I hope you can tell from the discussion thus far that SunTrust is driving some very solid core business momentum. But as I stated earlier, some of the momentum is being masked by legacy mortgage issues. The Mortgage line of business lost about $700 million in 2011 largely due to issues related to loans originated in 2008 and before. ","So we're continuing to work through these legacy issues, and we'll get them behind us in due time. In the meantime, our mortgage origination volume continues to be healthy. It's got attractive margins. It's relationship driven, and our risk management has significantly improved. As evidence of our client-centric approach to origination, we just ranked second highest overall in customer satisfaction according to the 2011 J.D. Power survey. ","Our Corporate Treasury and Other segment is next in line by revenues. What I want to point out here is that due to our intense focus on balance sheet management, we were very well positioned for the lower-for-longer rate environment. We have a lot more discipline at SunTrust around our asset and liability pricing, and you see the benefits of that showing up in our NIM which, while down slightly, is still well above our own historical average. ","Lastly, Commercial Real Estate, our smallest business but one with a great amount of potential for earning asset growth. CRE lost $300 million in 2011 as it also had a housing-related exposure, but on a relative basis, we had significantly fewer challenges than many of our peers. We're beginning to see opportunity in the marketplace in select markets and in particular asset classes. We transitioned this business back into production mode, and we believe there's good future potential here. As with our other nonhousing-related exposures, our commercial-oriented real estate businesses have also performed relatively well through the cycle. ","Now let's move to the last slide of recap. While 2011 was a challenging year, overall, we ended it with significantly better momentum than when it began. Full year EPS was up meaningfully from last year. Balance sheet trends closed favorably. Low-cost deposits continued to increase, and loan growth exhibited a notable pickup during the third and fourth quarters, particularly in the portfolios that we targeted for growth. Many of our core businesses demonstrated good trends throughout the year, helping to offset some of the regulatory and environmental headwinds we faced on the fee side of the business. ","Credit quality improved steadily through 2011. We further reduced our exposure to higher-risk loans and have produced a much better diversified and lower-risk balance sheet. Our capital ratios remain strong at the close of the year and well in excess of the current and proposed regulatory requirements. We repaid the government's TARP investment in a less dilutive manner and increased our common dividend to shareholders during 2011. We hope to be able to increase our return of capital to shareholders coming out of this year's CCAR process. From an operating perspective, we launched our PPG Expense Program and made progress towards our goal. We also saw results from our other strategic priorities. ","So we've clearly generated momentum in many of the key areas of our business. Our focus on our strategic priorities is yielding results, and we're committed to building our -- on our momentum as we move into the year. ","I know we spent a lot of time, but we had a lot to cover today. So with that, Kris, let me turn it over, and let's take in to Q&A","Kristopher Dickson","All right. Wendy, we're ready to open the line for Q&A. I'd like to ask the participants to please limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","If you could just hone in on the expenses a little bit. You talked about some of the moving pieces going into 1Q. But just as we think about reported expenses from 4Q to 1Q, any clarity you can give on the absolute level? Did they go up, down, relatively flat?","Aleem Gillani","Well, as you said, Matt, we've got a lot of moving pieces. We do know that there will be some of those moving pieces that will go up in 1Q. As you know, FICA expenses typically go up in 1Q, and our compensation plans will reset for the quarter. So we expect those things to go up. We are continuing to get benefits from our PPG program, and we expect that there will be further expense cuts as a result of that program as we move forward during the year. So that will be a benefit. I think the big key overall for us is our credit-related and operating expenses and operating loss expenses and how those look. And it's just too early in the quarter to give you a really good indication of how we -- how those will look for the full quarter.","William Henry Rogers","And Matt, it's Bill. And I  know it's frustrating to sort of look at the absolute level, but we're really tightening down to make sure that we're fundamentally changing the core run rate of expenses. And we're going to provide a lot of transparency on this PPG program so you can gain some confidence that that's happening. And as we stated, I think for the 2011, we gained a lot of momentum. I'm confident of where we're headed to this to get that run rate by 2013.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I guess maybe just taking another stab at this. If we take out the credit-related expenses and the operating losses, which can be very variable, I can appreciate that. If we take that out and we think about cost for the full year of 2012 versus 2011, do they come down? Or I'm just trying to get some kind of absolute guidance or a little more clarity on the underlying expense trends as we go forward just to make sure that there's steady progress going on or how to think about that.","William Henry Rogers","Matt, it's Bill. Let me try to take it at a really, really high level, and then we can dive down anywhere you want to. But sort of taking it at our highest level and doing it the way you suggested, we've got about a $6 billion expense base. We have about $800 million of the credit and operating expenses. So core expense run rate's about $5.2 billion. And then sort of take that as its -- sort of the working number. What we'll do by 2013 is we'll take $300 million out of that core expense base. Now it will grow. Because it's core, it'll grow by whatever it may grow by, merit increases, investments in the business and all that kind of stuff. But if you look at our past history on that core base, sort of about what we've shown before if you take E squared out, that was really, really low single-digit growth over the past, actually, 5 years in that core expense base. So we're going to take $300 million out of it and then it will grow at it's well-managed type of base. And then as it relates to the $800 million, it's just hard to predict. I mean, we know that's going to come down. We know it's going to come down appreciably. It's just hard to predict on a quarter-to-quarter basis exactly when that's going to happen.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So taking the $5.2 billion, if I assume, say, a 3% growth in our core growth in 2012 and 3% in 2013 and then you phase in the $300 million, just say half and half, that would imply flattish expenses in '12 and '13...","William Henry Rogers","And I think your assumption of the core growth is high, so start with that as a premise. When I say low single digits, I mean really low single digits.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So hopefully we come down then each year off of the $5.2 billion.","William Henry Rogers","I think when we get to 2013, that should be flat to slightly down, including that $300 million. And Matt, as we've also said, which we've been clear about, this is also efficiency ratio driven. So that answer will also be predicated around our revenue and our opportunities around revenue.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Conor Fitzgerald ","This is Conor Fitzgerald for Erika. Just heading into CCAR, can you talk about how you thought about stress case kind of put-back losses if the economy deteriorates like the Fed outlined? And do you have a sense about, like, if regulators are thinking about it the same way?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Conor, we can't tell you exactly how they're thinking about it. We can tell you how we thought about it. You know what the stress case was and the kind of assumptions that were built into the Fed stress case: Substantially higher unemployment rates, substantially lower housing prices and substantially lower GDP. And when we modeled all of those things through in the stress case numbers that we presented to them, they did result in higher put-back numbers than we had in our base case. However, everything that we had modeled through resulted in very high capital ratios at the end of this process and what we believe to be numbers that they will find highly acceptable. So yes, we did model higher put-backs, but nothing that ought to damage our ability to sail through the CCAR process.","William Henry Rogers","And Conor, it's Bill. This -- and we dealt with this last year as well. So I think we've got some credibility with our modeling as it relates to that process. And last year, as you know, we were highly TARP focused, and I think you'd have to say the result of our CCAR process as it relates to TARP was very successful.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Patten with Morgan Keegan.","Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just following up on Matt's question. We talked about the core numbers. Any -- can I get you to tackle the environmental as it trims down over the next couple of years?","William Henry Rogers","Let's all take a couple of cracks at it. How about that? Because in fairness, it's just -- it's hard to predict it quarter-to-quarter. Aleem, you want to take the first shot, and I'll jump right in.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. And I don't know that I can give you enormous confidence, Bob, but honestly, we don't know where this is going except directionally, it will be down. Clearly, as the economy normalizes, our credit and collections expenses will come down. Our OREO expenses will come down. Our operating losses will come down. We're leveraged to the economy, and that's where all of these are going. Also, as we move through the backlog of properties that sit in Florida and as that inventory comes down over time, all of the associated expenses with those homes: Insurance, maintenance, et cetera, will come down. So I think, directionally, I can give you very good confidence on which way it's headed, and unfortunately, quarter-to-quarter volatility, I can't give you exact guidance.","William Henry Rogers","And Bob, I think for us, related to that Florida-specific exposure to Aleem's comment, property taxes, given that's a no income tax state, they're higher in the state of Florida. It's a judicial foreclosure state, so we're stuck with a multi-hundred million dollar portfolio that we sort of can't get all the way moved through yet. So to Aleem's point, we can see it. I mean, the proverbial rat through the python is being digested at a rate, and I have confidence where it'll end up. It's just a hard quarter-to-quarter number to nail.","Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","I know, Bill. And not that I want to create more work for Kris, but I guess is there any way to think about the number of homes in Florida, the sheer number that we've been through to date, how much more is to go or maybe some kind of way we can take a look at that inventory and say we're making progress on it?","William Henry Rogers","Well, I have no hesitation about making more work for Kris. That is not something that I worry about. Let us think through that. I mean, it's a good question, and let us think through if there's a more granular disclosure that will help give you sort of a longer-term confidence. I hope you can hear from our voices, we have long-term confidence, we're just very apprehensive about giving a quarter-to-quarter guidance.","Robert S. Patten - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","No, it's a sticky number and there's a lot of people involved in that number too.","Operator","Our next question is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was going to follow up on the repatriation question, the capital repatriation. I understand that a lot of this is going to rest on the CCAR, but can you just I guess talk about the type of capital that you expect to return to shareholders next year? You already have a $0.05 dividend in place, so that's a $100 million already. But can you talk about appetite for buybacks or your thoughts on capital repatriation as a whole?","William Henry Rogers","Jefferson, this is Bill. Let me sort of -- there's not a whole lot we can say, but let me sort of take it at a high level. If you, again, sort of take it back to last year, we put all our eggs in essentially one basket. And with guidance from our shareholders, that basket was to get out of TARP in the less dilutive manner possible. So last year, we were sort of focused -- we were a one-trick pony, so to speak. This year, we'll be very different. And if you think about this year, where we're approaching it from different from last year, I mean, we're profitable. We've generated more capital. Our credit metrics are wildly better. We've got good dynamics as it relates to asset growth and deposit growth. So the fundamentals are just different. So I think at sort of the very, very highest level, what you could expect to see from us is an improved return to shareholders and a more balanced mix.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's very helpful. And for my follow-up, I just want to ask about the direct [ph] warranty provision, that $215 million. It sounded like we expect that to still be in that range for the next quarter or 2, but I just wanted to see what you guys -- see if that's what you guys think.","Aleem Gillani","Well, it's probably just a little bit too early in the quarter yet, Jefferson, to give you a sense of how it looks for the quarter. What I can tell you is that the trends that we're starting to see now are a little bit encouraging for us and that the move that we've now got past 2011, we're past that 3-year period for the 3 most challenging vintages, 2006 to 2008 for us. So that should indicate a lower set of demands going forward and in the trend that we see from the agency starting to move in their full file request promise to loans that are delinquent rather than loans that are actually in foreclosure. Those kinds of trends are encouraging, and those ought to play out over the rest of 2012. The next quarter or 2, we certainly do expect provisions and demands to be elevated, but I can't tell you exactly whether they're going to be where we are -- where we were in Q4 or lower than that.","Operator","Our next question is from Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question regarding balance sheet strategy going forward into 2012 centered around the loan growth and how it would impact net interest margin and net interest income. It looks like you've had very good growth. And as 2012 plays out, would you anticipate that growth to continue, maybe continuing to put more mortgages on the balance sheet? And when you think about the spread of the incremental growth maybe being dilutive to margin, but we could see net interest income grow somewhere to what we saw this quarter.","Aleem Gillani","It's Aleem. A couple of points there. The loans that we put on the balance sheet -- the government-guaranteed loans that we put on the balance sheet over the last couple of years, I think, have actually proven to be very helpful for us, very successful through a period of time when the economy wasn't growing at all. So they were a terrific bridge to help manage the balance sheet. Going forward, I would actually annualize, as you saw, we put 4% -- we had 4% loan growth in the fourth quarter, I wouldn't actually annualize that going forward and think about that kind of number going forward as a result of portfolio purchases and putting government-guaranteed loans on our books. If we start to see the organic loan growth that we saw in the last couple of quarters continue on through 2012, obviously, client-related business will have the first call on our balance sheet and our liquidity, and we'd much rather do organic client business than the kind of government-guaranteed product that we put on. So it was a successful strategy for us in the past. Hopefully, it starts to decline now as the economy starts to come back and we're able to do more client business and lend more money to clients.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Would it be fair to look at net interest margin, expect some degree of compression like you alluded to in the first quarter but still having the ability to grow net interest income in 2012?","Aleem Gillani","We will be focused on net interest income. I think it'll be challenging for the entire industry given where asset yields have gone over the last couple of years. And if you think about the 3-year swaps, for example, now at 70 basis points, it's pretty hard to make money when that's the gross yield that the market is offering you. So I do expect margins will drop for the entire industry, and we will be focused on net interest income rather than margin. But we also have a couple of levers, I think, that we can continue to try to pull to try to improve net interest income and margin over the course of the year. We're going to be focused on additional deposit pricing initiatives. We've got some more debt rolling off the books. And to the extent that we can, we're going to be focused on what we're able to do on the TruPS side, too. So we're going to be doing whatever we can to manage the balance sheet appropriately and try and grow income and mitigate the margin decline.","William Henry Rogers","And Greg, I think Aleem's point was really the one -- the critical point strategically is to start replacing some of that lower NIM, although low-risk, government-guaranteed business with more client-centric-oriented business. And as Aleem said, I think that's been a smart strategy for us. We were very aggressive in getting the higher-risk loans down. And I don't want to use the word plug, we were putting a place on our balance sheet on low risk while we were waiting for and working towards getting more of our client-centric businesses back on a positive trend.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about the pricing environment on the loan front, what you're seeing there in terms of trends and then how that's impacting the shared national credit space in terms of the spreads you're able to achieve in that book?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I'll start at the high level, and it's something we've been really concerned about, obviously, as all of us have been asset-hungry here in the last several quarters. And it is a very competitive environment, so I don't want to be dismissive of that at all. But that being said, maybe a lot due to scale and focus on client and selection and all that kind of stuff, but spreads have held up pretty well. I mean, spreads in the fourth quarter, coming on spreads were pretty consistent across most lines of business with where they were in the third quarter. A couple of aberrations in a different line of business, but overall, we've not seen a significant declination in spreads, fourth quarter to -- in accordance [ph] so far, sort of continuing to hold up.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the loan demand on the core book, can you give us some additional color on what your commitments did this quarter? And then also a little bit more color around the pipeline for the commercial book.","William Henry Rogers","The commitment story is good in the sense that commitments were going up in some of our businesses. 2.5x to 3x core outstandings were going up, so the good news is we're adding core new relationships and utilization rates, which hopefully are harbingers for the future. But utilization rates in the CIB side are pretty flat. And so while commitments are up, number of new relationships -- so it's not just adding bigger commitments, it's adding new lead relationships -- are up fairly dramatically and again, in some cases, at 2.5:3.1 ratio. In the commercial side, utilization rate actually was up a little bit. In addition there, the commitments probably were more tracking the additional and outstandings. I don't know if you had anything, Aleem, to add to that. So the good news, it's healthy on virtually every front versus it's just a big utilization push or bigger commitments or those kinds of things. This is just core blocking and tackling, adding new relationships, adding new commitments in a low utilization rate environment.","Aleem Gillani","And the only other point I'd add to that, John, is when you sort of step back and look at the year and what that sort of tells you year-over-year about the economy and how we're able to do within that, actual loan production for us went up 13% year-over-year. So I think that gives you a good indication of what's happening in the overall economy and what we're able to do for our clients.","William Henry Rogers","And the third and fourth quarter were particularly good on the production side.","Operator","Our final question today is from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about -- and I wanted to tell you I appreciated the format you put together on looking at the detail of the mortgage repurchase. In my mind, the critical assumption really lies on that 20.9%. In other words, when you start looking at whatever been's delinquent at a little over $20 billion. And so far, you've had 20% of those get pushed back to you. What was -- if you kind of think about in guesstimate of the population of your loans that potentially would have had those borrower misrepresentations or appraisal issues, so what's kind of maybe the guesstimate of what that 20% number could be in the whole population of the portfolio?","Aleem Gillani","Help me with your question for a moment, Marty. Are you asking what you think that 20.9% request rate could go to?","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. In other words, if we have a subset of loans that are already fixed and the only issue is the agencies have to go through the loan documents to get to the amount that have deficiencies, if we kind of knew what the percentage was that -- were potential to have deficiencies, we got to be closing in on that number, because they've had a couple of years to work at this. And especially recently, they've been very active. So I wanted to get a feel for out of the general population, what is your kind of rule of thumb that had these deficiencies that would potentially be coming back to us?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think there are several things that go into that, Marty. There's sort of the -- that's one issue, is where are there issues, they can come back, and there are several subsets within those. It's borrower misrepresentation. It's documentation issues. It's appraisal issues. It's a whole list of those things. But I think, as we talk with the agencies, they seem to be looking at sort of 2 variables within that. One is the amount of time that's gone by for which the loan has been delinquent. And as I said earlier, the -- there seems to be a very, very high correlation between the demand and the amount of time, with 0 to 36 months being the key. So that is particularly helpful to us in the industry as we now move past those 3 most challenging vintages. I think the other big issue that the agency seemed to be looking at is LTV. And to the extent that the housing market has stabilized from here and LTVs don't continue to decline, I think that will also be helpful. Both of those things, I think, Marty, are going to help mitigate the rise in the request rate. Because this is a cumulative request rate, 20.9%, your point is dead on. It will rise from here, but I think both of those issues I just mentioned will help mitigate that rise, and it just -- it shouldn't go up significantly more from the kinds of numbers we've been seeing. Does that help? Does that get at your point?","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Well, it does. I mean, I think the amount of time actually limits the loans over 120 days past due. Whatever comes to past due past this doesn't really matter, because you've already passed that timeframe. So the $21.2 billion there stays the same because we've already passed out of the sweet spot of when they could actually think about it from that standpoint. I was just curious in the overall portfolio. To me, if you were to get to 30%, that would just be an extraordinarily high number relative to loans that were delivered to agencies that had a potential discrepancy that would give them the right to give it back to you. So I think we were -- as a banking, looked at regulated, and that was something that we all spent a lot of time on. So that's -- you're saying that we're getting close to the top at 21%. If you double that number and get to 30%, you can only add about another $500 million to $600 million, which you've already reserved $300 million. So the incremental impact from here going forward has to start to wane just because we've kind of gone through the subset that's potentially able to get back to us.","William Henry Rogers","Marty, I'm glad you found this framework helpful.","Kristopher Dickson","Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

I'll begin with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year, which we highlight on Slide 3 and 4, and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. I'll conclude with some more strategic perspectives on our 2017 performance, our purpose and thoughts headed into 2018. ","We reported $1.48 of earnings per share for the quarter, which includes $0.39 per share in net benefits associated with the actions we announced on our December 4 8-K and the impact of tax reform, including actions we took as a result. The December 4 8-K primarily highlighted the sale of our PAC business and associated gain but also important initiatives around organizational efficiency, technology enhancements and real estate that will collectively better position the company for improved long-term success. In addition, given our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being, we thought it was important to invest a portion of the benefits of tax reform in our teammates and communities, each of which is foundational to our success. These contributions, which totaled $75 million in the fourth quarter, will support the financial confidence of our teammates and communities for years to come. ","Aleem will provide more details on these items but I'm going to focus on the adjusted earnings, which were $1.09 for the quarter and $4.09 for the full year. Overall, I'd characterize this quarter as a good conclusion to a very strong year for SunTrust. In 2017, we grew the core earnings of the company by 14%, improved our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio by 100 basis points, increased our dividend by 54% and our share repurchases by 38%. As owners, you certainly benefited from our strong performance. Our total shareholder return was 20%, which was more than 700 basis points higher than the median of our peer group. ","While we benefited from a favorable operating environment, a key driver of our outperformance this year was our improved executional abilities. We have instilled a culture of continuous improvement across the company. We've raised the bar together, and teammates have risen to the challenge. We're meeting more client needs. We're showing increased discipline on expenses and returns. We're ultimately improving the long-term earnings power of the franchise. ","So to get into some of the specifics of the quarter, our net interest margin improved by 2 basis points sequentially, which drove a modest increase in net interest income. Fourth quarter lending activity was not meaningfully different with all of 2017, with solid consumer lending growth offset by declines in C&I. Tax reform should begin to change the trajectory of C&I though the timing and slope are difficult to predict at this juncture. ","From the fee side, we had another great full year in capital markets even after the fourth quarter decline. Certain deal activity was pushed into 2018, and much of this decline was offset by strength in client-driven commercial real estate income, particularly Structured Real Estate where pipelines have been building nicely throughout the year and were realized in the fourth quarter. All in all, revenues were stable sequentially and up 5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. ","On an adjusted basis, we showed continuous improvement in our efficiency with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 59.9% in the fourth quarter and 61% for the full year. Looking to 2018, the impact of tax reform has on our FTE adjustments and compensation growth will be a bit of an efficiency headwind for us and the industry. But given the actions we took in the last 2 quarters of the year, combined with our ongoing expense discipline, which had us on a path to be around 60% in 2018 before the FTE change, we still expect to improve our efficiency ratio this year. Aleem is going to talk more about this in a minute. ","Credit quality continues to be a strength for us, and the full year net charge-off ratio was 25 basis points, the fourth consecutive year of net charge-offs being below our through-the-cycle expectations. This reflects a strong economic environment, the diversity of our loan portfolio and the conservative risk posture we've taken. Even after an almost 90% total payout ratio in 2017, capital ratios ended the year higher than where they started with a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.6% on a fully phased-in basis, giving us some incremental capacity to support strong growth for both our clients and our owners. ","So with that as an overview, let me turn over to Aleem.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. As Bill mentioned, there are several discrete items in the quarter, which we list on Slide 5. The first set of items relates to the actions we took in our December 4 8-K, including the sale of our PAC business, which resulted in a $107 million pretax gain. PAC contributed approximately $55 million of revenue, $25 million of expense and $20 million of net income over the last 12 months. Much of the PAC gain was offset by several charges in the fourth quarter, which allow us to accelerate certain efficiency initiatives. Specifically, we offered a voluntary retirement option to eligible teammates, consolidated operation centers, terminated additional branch leases, wrote down certain software assets and prepared for the consolidation of our mortgage legal entity into the bank, the latter of which partially impacted the valuation allowance against DTAs within SunTrust Mortgage. The net impact of all these items was a $0.03 EPS benefit. ","Separately, in connection with tax reform, our net deferred tax liability position was reduced by approximately $300 million, which resulted in an income tax benefit this quarter. We also took certain actions to enhance the company's future earnings potential, including a repositioning of our securities portfolio. Finally, as Bill mentioned, we announced important investments in the long-term financial well-being of our teammates and communities. The net impact of these items was a $0.36 EPS benefit. In 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% on a reported basis and 21% to 22% if you model us on a fully taxable equivalent basis. ","Moving to Slide 6. Our net interest margin improved 2 basis points this quarter, in part due to some discrete benefits in the current quarter, including loan fees and nonaccrual recoveries. When excluding these items, the net interest margin was relatively stable as the benefit from lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio was largely offset by an increase in deposit costs. ","Separately, as you know, we and many of our peers in the industry report our NIM and efficiency ratio on a fully taxable equivalent basis or FTE, which means we gross up the interest income on tax-exempt loans by approximately 35% to reflect the equivalent yield they would earn if the interest income were taxable. This adjustment increases our net interest income by approximately $150 million per year, which positively impacts our NIM by 8 basis points. All things being equal, a lower corporate tax rate will reduce the FTE adjustment by about half and negatively impact our FTE NIM by 4 basis points and the FTE efficiency ratio by 50 basis points. From a bottom line perspective, there's no impact as these changes simply impact income statement geography. ","During the quarter, we sold about $3 billion of securities and reinvested in a portfolio with similar mix and higher yields, which will increase interest income by approximately $20 million per year, all else equal. Looking at the first quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase between 0 and 2 basis points as the benefit of the December rate hike is mostly offset by the change in FTE calculation. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment, but we do expect NIM expansion in 2018 as the short end of the curve continues to rise. ","Moving to Slide 7, you'll see that noninterest income decreased by $13 million sequentially largely due to the decline in capital markets-related income given our strong performance in the first 3 quarters of the year and the delay of certain client transactions into 2018. While capital markets-related income was down for 1 quarter, on a full year basis, investment banking income was up 21%, which represents the 10th consecutive year of growth and was a key contributor to our overall revenue growth in 2017. Much of the decline in capital markets was offset by a higher commercial real estate-related income, which increased $45 million sequentially due to Structured Real Estate transactions and seasonality in both Pillar and SunTrust Community Capital, our affordable housing and community development business. And finally, the net impact of the discrete items I discussed on Slide 5 was a $7 million negative impact to noninterest income. Looking to the next quarter, we expect capital markets to rebound nicely while commercial real estate-related income will decline from that seasonally strong fourth quarter level. ","Expenses increased by $129 million sequentially driven by the discrete items in the current quarter, which we discussed on Slide 5, in addition to the net $14 million of discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. We have now taken $80 million of efficiency-related charges in the past 2 quarters, which collectively have an approximate 2-year payback. On a core basis, expenses were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter and prior year as a result of improved expense management and efficiency efforts. As a reminder, our core personnel expenses, which exclude the $25 million increase in employee benefits in the fourth quarter, should increase by approximately $75 million in the first quarter due to the typical seasonal increase in 401(k) and FICA expenses. ","As you see on Slide 9, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.9% and 61% for the full year. It's clear that the efficiency initiatives we've been implementing for several years are driving consistent, positive operating leverage. Not only have the investments we've made in growth driven strong revenue, we're also demonstrating heightened vigor around expense management, which enabled us to deliver a full year efficiency ratio that was at the bottom of our guided range. Looking to 2018, there will be certain headwinds to efficiency as a result of tax reform, both optical from FTE adjustments and actual from increased investments in our people and technology. Even after this, we're confident in our ability to improve the efficiency ratio in 2018 due to our heightened expense discipline, the actions we took in the last 2 quarters and a positive economic and revenue outlook. ","Moving to Slide 10. Net charge-offs increased 8 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by the resolution of certain C&I credits that have been in our workout pipeline. Despite this, our asset quality metrics remained very strong and well below through-the-cycle expectations, evidenced by a full year 25 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 47 basis point nonperforming loan ratio. The low level of net charge-offs reflect the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I portfolio, performance we are extremely pleased with, though we remain cognizant that there could be both variability and normalization going forward. Provision expense declined as a result of the prior quarter reserve build related to the hurricanes. Overall, we expect to operate within a 25 to 35 basis point net charge-off ratio in 2018 and expect a provision level that should approximate net charge-offs, though there may be some quarter-to-quarter variability. ","Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in consumer lending offset declines in C&I. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew 1% with broad-based growth across most consumer lending products. Within C&I, lower revolver utilization and elevated paydowns continue to mask improving production numbers. Some of the decline is also due to our increased focus on returns, which has led us to exit certain lending relationships which don't meet our return hurdles. Looking ahead, we continue to have positive dialogue with our clients, and we believe that tax reform is a catalyst for increased investment and growth. Further, we're well positioned to meet their needs, whether via lending, capital markets or other solutions. ","Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially and 2% year-over-year with growth across most products and both segments. Consistent with our previous commentary, the strong deposit growth we have produced over the past several years, in addition to our access to low-cost funding, enables us to prudently manage our funding base and, therefore, more effectively manage our overall deposit beta. Our goal continues to be to maximize our value proposition outside of rate paid by meeting more of our clients' needs via strategic investments in talent and technology. ","Let's move to Slide 13. Given the net gains this quarter, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.6%, up slightly relative to the prior quarter. In addition, we issued $500 million of preferred stock in November, helping us to further optimize our capital stack and reduce our weighted average cost of capital. At this point, our non-common Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital stacks are fairly optimized, and any other near-term issuance will be limited to refinancing existing issues and\/or replacing maturities. Given our strong capital position, combined with our improved earnings trajectory, we have incremental capacity to increase capital returns to our owners, the specifics of which will depend upon our rigorous capital planning process over the coming months. ","Moving to the segment overviews, we'll begin with the Consumer segment on Slide 14, where we continue to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. One of our primary strategic priorities at SunTrust has been to improve our balance sheet diversity and enhance returns. As a result, we've invested consistently in LightStream and our credit card business. The investments we've made continue to yield positive results, which have more than offset the declines in home equity, evidenced by the 5% increase in average total loans in 2017. These efforts, combined with our continued deposit growth, were key drivers of the 7% full year increase in net interest income. Growth in net interest income helped to offset the 17% decline in mortgage production volume. ","Noninterest income was also pressured by lower service charges given the posting order changes that were made in the fourth quarter of 2016. On the other hand, our wealth management business is beginning to show modest growth, a reversal of previous trends. We took significant actions in 2017 to improve our client coverage model and are seeing early results. We have also invested in new advisers, both within our existing markets and in new markets. Big picture, our value proposition for our targeted client segments is resonating in the marketplace, driving growth in new clients, greater wallet share with existing clients and overall AUM growth. ","Expenses were up $117 million relative to the prior quarter, driven primarily by the discrete items in the current quarter, including the discretionary 401(k) contribution and efficiency-related charges. The third quarter was also favorably impacted by the $58 million in legal accrual reversals. Expenses were stable relative to 2016 as a result of our continued expense management efforts, including continued reductions in our branch network and investments in self-served channels, including mobile. ","Provision expense increased $196 million relative to 2016 as a result of the reserve build associated with the hurricanes, in addition to strong loan growth. Overall, we took significant actions in 2017 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Consumer segment, including the integration of mortgage into consumer. We are beginning to realize the benefits of the strategic change, which creates an enhanced client-centric approach by having all consumer products and services under one segment and improves scale. We are in the early stages of executing this strategy. We've got a great team in place and are confident about the potential this segment has to grow revenues and improve profitability. ","Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 15. For this business, 2017 was a great year. We delivered record revenue of $4.1 billion and record net income of $1.4 billion, in part due to strong market conditions and a benign credit environment but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we're having with our clients. Fourth quarter revenue was inclusive of the $107 million gain on the sale of PAC. After excluding this, revenues were up 1% sequentially and 14% on a full year basis. The sequential increase was driven primarily by higher net interest income and commercial real estate-related income, which offset the decline in capital markets. Compared to 2016, the increase in revenue was primarily driven by net interest income and investment banking income, which was up by a full 21%. ","Investment banking's performance demonstrates the success we're having in increasing our strategic relevance with new and existing clients. It is clear that we're continuing to take market share and become a more relevant capital markets provider. Specifically, our left -- lead relationships are up 12%, M&A and equity both had record years and our average fee per transaction was up 9%. Additionally, we're not just becoming more relevant with our CIB clients, we're also -- we also continue to focus on bringing product and industry expertise to our commercial banking clients. We're making good progress here and earned a 10% increase in capital markets revenues from these clients in 2017. We have great momentum going into 2018, and we're very confident in our abilities to continue to grow capital markets revenues. ","Noninterest expense was up 12% relative to 2016 as a result of the acquisition of Pillar. Higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth and ongoing investments in technology. Core revenue growth was a strong 14%, and as a result, wholesale's adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved by 130 basis points to 44.5%. Provision expense declined meaningfully in 2017, given the continued resolution of energy credits and overall strength within the C&I portfolio. These declines, combined with the strong revenue growth and improved profitability, drove meaningful improvements in net income, which was up 34% even after excluding the sale of PAC. Looking ahead, while market conditions may create quarterly variability, our differentiated business model and strong executional abilities in Wholesale Banking deliver strong results for our clients and shareholders. We expect to see further growth in 2018, particularly as economic growth accelerates in response to tax reform. ","With that, let me turn the call back over to Bill.","William Rogers","Thanks, Aleem. I'll forward to Slide 16, which highlights how our long-term financial performance trajectory, including 2017, aligns with our overall investment thesis. First, we have an attractive franchise with great diversity and growth opportunities. This diversity helped drive revenue growth and 14% core EPS growth compared to 2016 even after absorbing the 37% decline in mortgage production income. The growth we continue to see is largely the result of the consistent strategic investments we've made over the years. Specifically, within CIB, we've been particularly focused on investing in our M&A and equity platforms to allow us to become the strategic adviser of choice. Both M&A and equity had record performance in 2017, and they have great momentum going into 2018. Our competitive advantage continues to resonate with clients and is a key contributor to our continued market share gains. ","Within commercial banking, we're investing heavily in developing our industry and Corporate Finance expertise such that we can deliver increasingly sophisticated solutions to our clients. While we're in the early stages, our execution against this strategy was a contributor to wholesale's record performance this year and also a key part of our decision to expand our commercial banking presence outside of our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic footprint. Within consumer, the investments we've made in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are providing top-notch experiences for our clients, in addition to consistent and profitable growth. ","And finally, across our company, we've made and continue to make meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. Specifically, we continue to invest heavily in our mobile app. We made it easier for clients to manage their financial well-being by adding advanced peer-to-peer payment capabilities using Zelle and displaying FICO scores. We gave clients more control over their financial lives by providing the ability to lock and unlock credit cards in real time. ","Additionally, we introduced SunTrust Deals, which offers personalized rewards and discounts based on clients' preferences and spending habits. We've also made good progress in developing an API and cloud-based framework for infrastructure development, which allows us to more easily integrate with apps, services and digital experiences across the ecosystem. And finally, we've significantly enhanced our core infrastructure by upgrading our loan origination platforms within wholesale and mortgage, transferring certain activities to the cloud and began upgrading our core teller platform, which, when combined with our introduction of Zelle, significantly enhances our broader payment capabilities. ","So looking to 2018, we'll continue to make significant investments in our technology platforms and have several items in the pipeline, including a new enterprise client portal, a fully digitized mortgage application and increased use of various forms of automation to streamline end-to-end processes and improve efficiency. As you can tell, we remain highly focused on improving our efficiency both to ensure we have sufficient capacity to make future investments in growth in technology and to improve the overall profitability of the company. ","We've made good progress this year, evidenced by the 100 basis point improvement in our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. We still have significant room for improvement, and there are a few important actions we took in 2017 to ensure that we fully capitalize upon our opportunity set. We decided to consolidate mortgage, which historically had been a separate business segment, into consumer. This provides us with the opportunities to streamline operations and created greater alignment among all of our consumer-oriented channels. ","We also created an efficiency office, and the work they've done have enabled a heightened focus and rigor around driving and sustaining efficiency in order to position the company for long-term growth and success. Finally, as Aleem highlighted, we took a total of $80 million in charges in the last 2 quarters, which allowed us to accelerate our progress against several key initiatives, primarily around organizational efficiency. These charges have a relatively short payback and further improvement in efficiency momentum we have going into -- and further the improvement of efficiency momentum we have going into 2018. ","Of note, as we improve the efficiency of the company, we're also enhancing our overall return profile. Specifically, when excluding the discrete benefits in the fourth quarter, our return on tangible common equity in 2017 was 12.2%, a full 130 basis points improvement over 2016. And last but certainly not least, our strong capital position allowed us to increase our capital return by 47% in 2017. We reduced our share count by 3%. And our dividend yield is now in the top 1\/3 relative to our peers, such as you as owners now benefit from an attractive yield combined with a franchise that has strong growth opportunities. ","While these business accomplishments, I think, are impressive, what I'm equally proud of is the progress we've made in advancing our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being. We launched Momentum onUp in June, which is the industry-leading workplace financial wellness program we offer to our corporate and commercial clients to equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success. We had 70 companies sign up in 2017, and the early results are extremely encouraging. Participants walk away with a much better understanding of their net worth, the importance of a budget, an emergency savings plan and, ultimately, greater financial confidence. In fact, 99.5% of participants would recommend Momentum onUp to others. ","We also celebrated the opening of SunTrust Park, which included the opening of the onUp Experience center, which is a unique space that uses fun and interactive baseball activities to engage fans to learn more about gaining financial confidence while also strengthening our brand as a purpose-driven, client-first company. And clearly, the $75 million investment announced in the fourth quarter will be meaningful in improving the long-term financial well-being of our teammates and our communities. ","Before I close, I wanted to tell you about a leadership appointment we'll be announcing after this call. Our Chief Information Officer, Anil Cheriyan, has decided to retire at the end of March. It seems appropriate to mention it here as he's been a significant contributor to the results we've delivered. Scott Case, who was previously our Consumer Technology Officer, will become our new CIO and is perfectly suited to build upon the technology momentum I just outlined. ","In conclusion, I'd like to say I'm incredibly proud of this company and the team that we have in place. For each of the past 6 years, we've grown the earnings of the company, we've improved our efficiency and we've increased our capital return to owners. We've been able to do this because of a consistent strategy and discipline around financial performance and returns. Looking into 2018, I'm optimistic about the tailwinds that tax reform will provide to us and the broader economy. Further, given our position within the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, we should see outsized benefits from increased economic growth. While tax reform will provide benefits to our bottom line and increase capacity to invest in clients, teammates, communities and owners, I continue to expect strong discipline and rigor in our balance sheet and investment prioritization process. ","We've made great progress in recent years, and the momentum we've created should help 2018 be the seventh consecutive year of higher earnings per share, improved efficiency and higher capital returns. Equally exciting now is my belief that we're just beginning to realize our long-term potential. I want to pause for a second and thank all of the great SunTrust teammates whose tireless dedication to our purpose makes all this possible. So teammates, thank you. ","And with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Leah, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we will take a question from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew O'Connor","You guys bank a very wide spectrum of commercial and corporate clients, obviously, both on the lending side and helping to originate debt on the banking side. So it's like you might have a good perspective on the potential for commercial loan demand to pick up and how meaningful that could be, the timing of that. Or does it kind of still get psyched away into the capital markets, which, obviously, you benefit as well? But just trying to get a sense of -- could we see a little more balance between the loan demand and some of the banking demand with the tax reform and maybe the timing of that?","William Rogers","Yes, Matt. We spend a whole lot of time with our clients. And I clearly feel and I think tax reform was a further accelerant, growing and increasing confidence in their business prospects, and we see that in the surveys that we did. If you -- I would just sort of look at ours and break it down. I think maybe it will actually help answer the question a little bit. If I think about sort of health metrics that I look at, sort of core loan growth, as Aleem mentioned, our production has been really good. As a matter of fact, this quarter was sort of our second-best production quarter, and the last quarter was our second-best production quarter in the last 8 quarters. So production as a health metric continues to be strong. Then if you look at sort of our core companies, middle market kind of lending, I mean that's continued to grow sort of mid-single digits.","So if that's a barometer of where the economy is, I think that's a pretty strong indication, and I think that, that should continue. So really, the hanging chat, as what you've talked about, is how much of this paydown part will continue. I think what we're seeing is an opportunity to increase investments. I think overall if I sort of look into '18 and beyond, I think, thinking about loan growth as a GDP plus kind of concept, I think, is realistic, but timing of that is a little hard to predict. I think that's probably a little more towards the latter part of this year and the first part of next year. But I just see that what I -- when I look at those health metrics, I see sort of like core commercial bases just continuing to grow.","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately, you guys had a very early partnership with GreenSky on the consumer lending area. And I think you guys had a stake or have a stake in that, and I'm wondering if you can confirm that and if you'd sized it. It's been in the press recently in terms of raising some private equity and [indiscernible] valuation on that, so I want to see if you could confirm your stake in that.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. Matt, it's Aleem. Yes, absolutely, we can confirm that we do have a stake in GreenSky and that we expect that the partnership that we have with them will continue to get better over time. We really like the partnership that we have with GreenSky. We think we were one of the early investors and have helped them grow. And so we think we have a special relationship with them, and we expect that to continue to do better over time.","Operator","And next, we have a question from the line of Ken Usdin.","Kenneth Usdin","Appreciate your opening comments about investing in the franchise with some of the benefits from tax and still committing to operating leverage. Just wondering if you could help us understand the phasing and even the magnitude of the incremental spend that you're thinking about and how you're balancing that against operating leverage. We obviously see it in the efficiency ratio guidance, but just wondering how you're balancing the 2.","William Rogers","Yes. Ken, it's Bill. I think let me sort of start with a punchline. I fundamentally believe that a large majority, and I don't want to put a percent on it, of the benefits of tax reform are going to fall to bottom line. So I mean, I think that's sort of where we start, and I think that's particularly over the short term. Beyond that, that becomes a little harder to predict and -- based on a lot of factors, including whatever the competitive environment may be. Now that being said, might there be some incremental investments that we make that make more sense now given tax reform? That might be the case, and we're going to look carefully at that. But that's going to go through our normal investment planning process, so I don't expect sort of a big step-up function.","As you know, we've been investing in our company for years and continue to do that. And a lot of the efficiency gains that we get, we continue to make part of our investment strategy. So that's been part of the fuel that's been pumping our investment for a while and will continue to do so. And then I also don't see any sort of glaring gap that is going to require us to spend hundreds of millions of dollars that we didn't spend before to fix or put in place. And as you noted, we're also making the commitment to continue to improve our efficiency ratio. I mean, if you sort of do the math, I mean, what we're saying is we think we'll have another 100 basis point improvement in our core efficiency ratio for this year.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. And as a follow-up on the lending side, you guys, in the past, have been relatively conservative and, I think, have talked about in the past that you'd like to stay on that side of things. But do you look at opportunity sets here, especially given the potential, as you mentioned, for loan growth to hopefully improve and think about either opening up the credit box a little bit or reevaluating some of the places where you'd like to see incremental business generation?","William Rogers","I think, as you know, I mean, we have been conservative. That's part of our strategy. We think we want a capital base that reflects that conservatism and see it in our CCAR results that are being at the lower decile or quartile of others in terms of capital degradation. That being said, at sort of post tax reform, are there new deals that might hurdle that didn't hurdle before? Yes, I mean, that might be the case. And we'll look at that on an individual basis. It will go through the same rigorous process that we have. But it's not a case of opening the floodgates. It's a case of sort of incrementally looking at opportunities, given some different dynamics from a return perspective.","Aleem Gillani","And Ken, let me come back to your first question for a moment on operating leverage and efficiency ratio. In '17 over '16, we delivered a full point of efficiency ratio improvement from 62% to 61%, and in '18, we expect to do that again. We expect to get another full point of efficiency ratio improvement. But just remember that optically, because of that FTE impact, that full point will look like 0.5 point.","Kenneth Usdin","Right. 50 basis points, right?","Aleem Gillani","Right. Thank you.","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","So I guess, just following up on reinvestment, positive operating leverage. Your tax guide, 20%, is about, I guess, a 10 percentage point reduction, more or less, to where you were. And you're generating about, I guess, $3 billion or so, more or less, in pretax profits, so it looks like the windfall is about $300 million or so. Have you put parameters or quantified how much of that you think is -- should be reinvested in various initiatives you talked about? How should we think about that in the context of your cost guidance -- or your cost expectations?","William Rogers","Yes. I think, I mean, back to the answer before, I think a large majority of that benefit is going to inure to the shareholders. I think the discipline that we've had in the system, the constant trade for efficiency and investment and that continued process that we've had in place, that's just not going to change. I mean, again, as I said before, there's not sort of a onetime thing that we're going to put in place. So I'm hesitant about putting percentages because I just don't think that's the way that we think about it. And I think just take solace in what we think, is the majority of that, again, in the short term is going to fall to the bottom line.","Saul Martinez","Okay, that's helpful. I guess just going back to the loan growth question then. You mentioned obviously utilization rates and paydowns being elevated. And I know you don't manage the loan growth, but is there any way to put some numbers or some parameters around how much fall in utilization rates and paydowns impacted your loan growth -- if we had a more normalized level of paydowns or utilization rates were constant, how much would that have impacted loan balances? And I just -- I guess I'm trying to get at, if those things do normalize, how much of a tailwind that could be going forward.","William Rogers","Yes. I mean, just not to put direct math to it because those are sort of constantly moving numbers, but if you just take C&I specifically, I mean, paydowns exceeded production. And we produced total loans somewhere in the $8 billion-plus kind of category so you can sort of do your own math on that in terms of what that might be if paydowns were to normalize. I struggle with it because I don't know what normalize means. I think we have to sort of think about environments change, things are in different mode. But my earlier comments around overall loan growth going forward, I think, take into account that things do return to levels that we've seen before, and I think that's where I get back to, sort of a GDP plus kind of mentality as we think about loan growth. So if we're looking at a 2.5% to 3% GDP, I think that's a reasonable expectation longer term, meaning sort of towards the end of this year and into next year as we think about loan growth.","Operator","And next, we have a question from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","On the commercial real estate-related income that you saw from Pillar and the other operations there, I think you alluded to some of that was impacted by tax-advantaged business. And would you say at all that a proportion of that is inflated this year because of the pending tax reform and accordingly, we can see a reversion next quarter? And if so, by how much is that delta so we can model it?","William Rogers","No. If the implication was that it was tax reform related, I don't think that's quite an accurate representation. It does have seasonality towards the fourth quarter. I mean that's just sort of the natural flow of that business. So all of that business is client-driven. It did have some seasonality, probably a little more beta on that seasonality than we normally have. So as it relates to next year, I mean, we expect that business to continue to be positive. The first quarter will be lower than the fourth quarter because that's just a seasonality impact rather than a fundamental change or onetime aspect of the business. So all client-driven, not onetime, not specific tax reform business, just sort of core good business in the fourth quarter.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. And then on the margin, wanted to get -- just to see if you could quantify the amount of the loan fees and -- or the benefits of the margin from the higher loan fees and interest recoveries in the quarter and then your thoughts on the trajectory of the margins through 2018 as deposit beta starts to build.","Aleem Gillani","John, the fees, I think, that we picked up in the fourth quarter, I would think in the context of 1 to 2 basis points. And then as I look out into 2018, the first quarter, I'd say, is kind of 0 to 2 basis points positive. And then after that, it depends on the trajectory of rate hikes. Any quarter that we get a Fed hike or the quarter after it will typically pick up three-or-so basis points. And then when -- in a quarter where there isn't a Fed hike, we'll get a little bit of a grind downward.","John Pancari","Okay. And remind me what you're modeling in terms of the Fed actions for 2018.","Aleem Gillani","Well, as you know, we're typically a little bit on the conservative side. So with the Fed suggesting that they'll hikes three times this year, we're modeling two hikes","Operator","And next, we go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Michael Mayo","My basic question is, why can't get to your 60% efficiency target in 2018 instead of 2019? Now you have additional tailwinds from rates, revenues, regulation, and not to take anything away from you, Bill. Since you've been there as CEO, the efficiency ratio is down 10 percentage points. I heard what you said. Last year, that improved by another percentage point. This year, you're expect it to improve by another percentage point, so, certainly, all going in the right direction. It just seems like -- if you wanted to, it seems like you could be there. Maybe that's why you're getting so many questions on the reinvestment. I mean, the list of investments, kind of like 10 different areas you're investing in based on just what was said on this call. So I guess to ask an earlier question a little bit differently, how do you balance the trade-off between letting some of these benefits fall to the bottom line to shareholders today and reinvesting that for shareholders in the future? It seems like your investments -- your pace of investing might have gone up, but if you could clarify that.","William Rogers","Yes. I think, Mike, first of all, these FTE adjustments are sort of making this conversation a little more difficult. Let me make it really clear. We're going to get to 60% net of the equity adjustment. So before, we've said 60% was a longer-term trajectory. And net of FTE, actually, we would get to 60% in '18. That's exactly the place where we want to be. So challenge accepted and delivered. Of course, we've got to deliver it for the year, but challenge accepted. As it relates to the continued level of investment, that's all in light of that efficiency target. We clearly have outlined things that we're investing in. I mean, constantly, that's what we evaluate as a company, but that's in light of the efficiencies that we create. So we run this through a model that sort of says invest -- save $1, invest $1 kind of process for our business leaders, with the thought process that you also got to continue to drive down the efficiency ratio.","So I think that intensity is in there. The reason we talk so much about investment is we want to make sure that everyone understands, from a shareholders' perspective, this is not a short-term gain for us. This is a long-term gain. So as soon as we're hitting the efficiency targets, we're also not forgetting the fact that we're investing for the long term in the company. So if we've over-calibrated maybe in terms of how we talk about that, I think, in fairness, we probably under-calibrated before. We didn't talk enough about investment and probably too much about expense saves. And really, the desire here is to calibrate and to balance that dialogue because they are both equally important and this is a long-term deal for us.","Michael Mayo","And then the follow-up relates to Slide 14. And compared to some peers, it's a disappointment compared to where you might want to go. Maybe it's an opportunity. But you closed 100 branches. That's 7% of the total. Yet, the efficiency ratio in the Consumer segment was flat '16 to '17. I think there must be some noise in that '17 number, but even after eliminating some of that noise, it seems like the consumer efficiency probably isn't where you need it to be. And you did highlight the investments in LightStream and digital banking and automation and cloud and the mortgage restructuring into consumer. What are your expectations for the Consumer segment efficiency? And did I characterize that correctly?","William Rogers","Well, also, I mean, you certainly characterized it correctly in terms of the opportunity. I mean, from a math perspective, just if you sort of -- so consumer and wholesale, just to make it easy, 50%, 50% of the business. Wholesale is pretty much at the efficiency ratio in terms of top quartile or top decile in terms of how we look at performance. Now that's not to take the bell off the hook by any means. I mean we want to continue to strive and do those kind of things. But the bulk of the efficiency savings going forward are in the Consumer segment, as you accurately pointed out. But things like the mortgage consolidation with consumer create savings. That's why that's highlighted. The branch closures start to create more opportunity on an ongoing basis. The other efficiencies that we've taken in terms of transactional efficiencies and process improvements really primarily rest in the consumer side.","Operator","And next, we have a question from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marlin Mosby","Maybe we'd take a little different tilt on the investments and talk about the returns. You have restructuring the securities portfolio this quarter, which you say it could generate $20 million. That's about a 5-year payback. That's pretty conservative. I would think that could do a little bit better even than that. You've got the $80 million, which is going to turn into $40 million of annual benefit that you've talked about there. And then you've been investing in your capital markets business, which then you talked about the deal activity that was spiked, but, yet, you didn't really even reap all the benefits of that as it comes in the first part of next year. So it looks like there's some returns that actually give you some momentum as you go into next year that you've been able to take from the investments you've been putting out there so far.","Aleem Gillani","Yes, Marty. I think you're completely right. We've got a number of initiatives that we put in place. We expect to be reaping the benefits of those initiatives over the course of the next several years. You're right about securities. You're right about the other things you've mentioned. There are a couple of efficiency ratio headwinds, as we've mentioned. But those are -- some of those are optical, and that's efficiency ratio as opposed to bottom line. If you focus on bottom line, we're pretty optimistic about what we can deliver over the next couple of years. And if you think about what our shareholders really care about, and it's the return on capital, we think that our ROTCE over the next couple of years is going to be considerably higher than it has been over the last couple of years. This year, as Bill mentioned earlier, we did grow our ROTCE to 12.2%. We've crossed that 12% barrier. And next couple of years, we're looking for floors to ROTCE that would be even higher than that.","Marlin Mosby","And a follow-up, so one of the backdrops of all your adjustments this particular quarter were a few nuggets that kind of also were hidden. One is your tangible book value was about 2% higher because you had the net gain from DTO versus a lot of other banks that were actually writing down their DTAs. So you actually had a 2% increase in tangible book value, which is a nice base adjustment. And then your capital ratios went up because of that as well, which then gives you even more kind of ammunition going into next year's CCAR and thinking about the acceleration of deploying some of that excess capital. So just wanted to think about those two things as well.","William Rogers","No, I think that's exactly right, Marty. And that's part of the reason we have the confidence in saying, of the things that are continuing on the seventh year of improvement is continued increase in our return to shareholders. So as you duly noted, we got to get all the CCAR stuff and all those caveats, but we enter into this with a stronger capital base and more opportunity to return to shareholders.","Aleem Gillani","Marty, I don't know if you've heard too many CFOs say this before, but I'm looking forward to seeing what the CCAR scenario is this year.","Marlin Mosby","I can imagine. And if you'll humor me one more question on credit. You have been building your allowance throughout the year, and then this quarter, you actually went the reverse. And it looks like you were providing for the losses that you took this quarter through the first 3 quarters of the year. So this was just a natural offset of that as you kind of got your provision down but net charge-offs bounced up just because of the recognition losses you already provided for.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. I'd say that our provision and allowance build was mostly in the third quarter, and that was for hurricanes. So we're expecting to see some of the hurricane charge-offs show up next year. And we provided for that early. Other than that, I'd say our allowance has been generally flat and maybe even slightly declining on a percentage basis.","Operator","That's the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","A couple of questions. Can you guys tell us, when you're talking about the commercial loan growth earlier, what your utilization rates are in the C&I portfolio? And how do they compare in the past? And what do you think they could be over the next 12 to 18 months?","William Rogers","Yes. They've been -- sort of been in the high 20s to low 30s, and they've been pretty consistent. I mean, that's a barometer that we all look at, but it moves in tectonic ways. I mean, it just doesn't move a lot in any one particular quarter. It's sort of slightly down now, but that's reflecting sort of some of the comments we've made. But I think that's one of the levers. But I think that's the lever, quite frankly, that moves the slowest. I think the things that we talked about in terms of production and paydowns have a bigger R-square, so to speak, to loan growth in the short term.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then second, obviously, you guys put up a good quarter, like many of your peers. 2017 has been a very good year for the banks and the bank stocks. '18 looks real good as well. So all of us know we have to look around corners for potential risks. What do you guys look at? Because, again, things are very good for you and for your peers, what do you kind of worry about? Or what are you looking on the horizon that you got to keep your eye on?","William Rogers","Yes. I think you clearly have to look around the corner and think about the things that are tail risk or that are pending risk. I think all the businesses that relate to leverage and higher rates, we have to factor in. And so whether that's things on the credit card side, whether that's leverage lending in any shape or form, that's simply something that we have to look at. I don't see that as a near-term issue, in fairness, but as rates increase and leverage stays high, that's something we have to look at. Anything related to cyber is something that we have to be concerned about and think about. So those risks are risks that keep going for us and the industry almost exponentially, so that's something that we have to be vigilant and concerned about.","Ankur Vyas","Leah, this concludes our call.

It's obviously impossible to start today's call without acknowledging the events in Boston, and clearly, our thoughts and prayers go out to that community this morning. In our usual fashion, I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter. Then, Aleem will provide more details on the results. After that, I'll come back to wrap up the call with some perspectives on our business segment performance.","Earnings per share for the quarter was $0.63, up substantially from $0.46 in the first quarter 2012. Highlights this quarter included a significant reduction in expenses due to our concerted and ongoing efforts towards driving efficiency improvements, as well as further contraction in our cyclically high cost. All told, expenses were down 12% from the first quarter of last year and at their lowest level in 3 years. As a result, our efficiency ratio improved by 5 percentage points year-over-year. It was also down nearly 1.5 percentage points from the fourth quarter despite a sequential quarter decline in revenues. Some of this revenue contraction was due to typical first quarter seasonal impacts, and some of it was a result of mortgage revenue normalizing downward from the strong levels experienced last year.","Loans and deposits were both relatively stable, while credit quality continued to improve with nonperforming loans declining 5% and 45% for the prior quarter and prior year, respectively. The first quarter net charge-off ratio of 76 basis points was at its lowest level in 5 years.","Lastly, our capital position continued to improve with Tier 1 common ratio reaching an all-time high at an estimated 10.1%. As you are aware, the capital actions we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process were not objected to by the Federal Reserve. This included increasing the return of capital to our shareholders in the forms of a higher common stock dividend and a share buyback. In our upcoming meeting, the board will consider a dividend increase to 10% per share -- $0.10 per share, up from our current $0.05. And we plan to complete our common stock buyback of up to $200 million by the first quarter of 2014. We're obviously pleased that our capital position and improved earnings power enable us these actions.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Aleem to walk you through this quarter's results in more detail.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us in the context of all of the events occurring across our country. I'll begin my comments today with summary observations on this quarter's key earnings drivers, and then we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides.","Our earnings per share for the quarter were $0.63, up $0.17 per share from last year and continuing our trend of strong year-over-year earnings growth. This was driven by the 12% decline in expenses that Bill mentioned, as well as a 33% reduction in the provision for credit losses in light of ongoing asset quality improvement. Lower net interest income was a partial offset.","Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, pretax earnings were higher driven by declines in expenses and the provision for credit losses, which more than offset lower sequential quarter revenue resulting in pretax earnings growth of $86 million. However, net income declined modestly, and earnings per share fell $0.02 as this quarter's effective tax rate increased to a more normal 30%, up from the 15% rate last quarter.","Let's take a more detailed review of the underlying trends starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined sequentially by $25 million or 2% primarily due to 2 fewer days in the current quarter. The net interest margin contracted by 3 basis points, as earning asset yield declined 6 basis points partially offset by modestly lower liability rates. Relative to the prior year, the net interest margin declined 16 basis points, and net interest income was lower by $91 million or 7%. This was due to $175 million reduction in interest income on earning assets with the primary drivers being the impact from the low-rate environment on loan and securities yields, the partial roll-off of our commercial loan swap portfolio and the foregone dividend income on the Coca-Cola stock following our third quarter transaction.","Partially offsetting lower interest income was an $85 million decline in interest expense. This was due to the favorable deposit mix shift, lower rates paid and a significant reduction in long-term debt expense driven by a $2 billion average balance decline and a 91 basis point improvement in borrowing costs.","As we look to the second quarter of 2013, net interest income will benefit from an increase in day count, though commercial loan swap income is expected to decline by $12 million due to scheduled swap maturities. This decline in swap income equates to about 3 basis points of net interest margin, which will be incremental to the ongoing core margin pressure we expect will continue in the second quarter.","Slide 6 shows trends in noninterest income. As usual, we have identified certain adjustment items, and the details of those are included in the appendix. Excluding these relatively minor adjustment items, noninterest income was down by $125 million sequentially. There were the usual seasonal reductions in certain categories, though the largest driver of the decline was mortgage production income. So let me spend a few moments there. Mortgage production income was $159 million this quarter. And this was down $82 million as compared to the prior quarter. Lower gain on sale accounted for almost all of the variance and was driven by 2 factors. First, the spread between primary and secondary market rates compressed during the quarter. You're aware that this spread was at historically wide levels in 2012, so we expected and planned for a decline this year. That happened in fairly quick order during January and February before leveling off somewhat in March. Second, gain on sale was also impacted by less favorable secondary market execution. The most notable example of this is that last year, investors were paying premiums for mortgage pools that had favorable prepayment characteristics. However, these premiums declined notably in the first quarter, as investors assessed the low absolute level of rates today versus their increasing expectation for higher rates in the future. The origination fee component of mortgage production, which totaled $61 million for the quarter was up $6 million sequentially driven by an 11% increase in production volume.","The other primary component of mortgage production income, the mortgage repurchase provision, was $14 million this quarter, which was consistent with last quarter's level and in line with our prior guidance. We have included the slide with quarterly mortgage repurchase trends in the appendix. Overall, repurchase activity continues to play out according to our expectations.","New demand increased this quarter due to an increased pace by the GSEs, while the pending population declined due to even higher increased resolutions by the GSEs and SunTrust. Meanwhile, full file requests, which as you know are the precursors to future demands, declined by 20% from the fourth quarter.","Investment banking was the other primary driver of the sequential quarter noninterest income decline, and it was lower by $44 million. There were a few factors at work here. Number one, we were coming off a record fourth quarter. Several clients also moved transactions, which were originally slated for the first quarter of this year into the fourth quarter of last year amidst the fiscal cliff uncertainty. This created a bit of a headwind for us in Q1 on top of the first quarter typically being the seasonal low point of the year. All that said, the outlook for our corporate and investment banking business remains strong, and we do expect to see investment banking income increase in the second quarter.","Relative to last year, adjusted noninterest income declined by $6 million. Mortgage servicing income was lower due to a smaller servicing portfolio and less favorable hedge performance. And trading and other noninterest income also declined. These were all largely offset by higher mortgage production income due to a lower mortgage repurchase provision. As we look to the second quarter, we expect noninterest income to pick up led by higher investment banking income and the seasonal uptick in service charges. As it relates to mortgage production, we expect volume to remain strong, which will support origination fees.","It's too early in the quarter to make predictions about gain on sale, but spreads have been stable since March. And we won't face the same headwinds as in the first quarter because the less favorable secondary market execution has now been absorbed into our run rate.","Let's now move to expenses on Slide 7. The decline in expenses was the highlight of the quarter, as we demonstrated traction in both our operating cost productions, as well as the ongoing abatement of cyclically high items. On a sequential quarter basis, expenses were down by $147 million or 10%. Approximately half of this decline was due to lower credit-related expenses and operating losses, the details of which we break out for you in the appendix.","Operating losses were $38 million lower primarily due to the $32 million expense recognized last quarter associated with the independent foreclosure review. Election expense declined by $21 million benefiting from the nonperforming loan sales that occurred late last year. The remaining expense decline was broad based across expense categories. A lone exception was employee compensation and benefits, which was up by $21 million due to the approximate $35 million seasonal increase in benefit expense. This was partially offset by a $20 million incentive compensation reduction associated with final payouts for 2012 performance.","Relative to the first quarter of last year, expenses were down by 12% on a reported basis and 11% adjusted. Credit-related expenses and operating losses declined by a combined $95 million or over 55%. Reductions of $50 million in OREO expense, and $21 million in operating losses were the largest drivers. Employee compensation and benefits declined by $38 million, and legal and consulting expenses were down $20 million, the latter, in part, due to the elimination of certain expenses associated with the independent foreclosure review.","Overall, we're pleased with our traction in driving operating costs and cyclical items lower. The almost $150 million sequential quarter expense decline was clearly a major step-down in one quarter. I will point out that a portion of this decline was aided by items that aren't likely to recur in the second quarter. For example, we won't have the favorable incentive compensation adjustment. OREO expenses are unlikely to remain at 0 as they were this quarter, and marketing and certain volume-related costs are expected to increase from their first quarter levels. On the flip side, benefits expenses are expected to decline due to their seasonal nature. Net-net, we expect to see a modest increase in core expenses in the second quarter, albeit still well below the levels at which we were operating last year.","As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to make steady progress in lowering our efficiency ratio. We show the ratio here on an adjusted basis and provide you the calculation details in the appendix. The efficiency ratio improved by 4.6 and 2.2 percentage points from the prior year and the prior quarter, respectively, with the declines from both periods driven by lower expenses.","We had previously indicated that we expect the tangible efficiency ratio to be 65% plus or minus for 2013. Based upon our first quarter's results, we're more confident that it will come in below 65%, and our focus continues to be on progressing toward our longer-term target of below 60%. And we will update you regularly on our progress in this regard.","Turning to credit quality on Slide 9. The ongoing improvement in asset quality trends continued this quarter. As Bill noted, the net charge-off ratio of 76 basis points was at its lowest level in 5 years. Net charge-offs were down by 45% from last year driven by residential mortgages, home equity and commercial real estate. They also improved from the fourth quarter. You'll recall that last quarter's net charge-offs were impacted by $118 million associated with the combined effects of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy reclassification and nonperforming loan sales. After excluding those items, this quarter's net charge-offs were still approximately 20% below fourth quarter's adjusted level.","The provision expense for the quarter was $212 million, which was comparable to the fourth quarter's core level and only modestly below current quarter net charge-offs. As such, the allowance for loan and lease losses held relatively stable, ending the quarter at 1.79% of loans.","Nonperforming loans and assets continued their favorable trends declining sequentially by 5% and 6%, respectively, and driven by residential mortgages. NPAs and NPLs were down 45% from last year with the declines prevalent in most loan classes most notably in residential mortgages, commercial real estate and commercial construction.","Delinquencies in the loan portfolio also continued to improve. The early-stage delinquency ratio, excluding government guaranteed loans was 41 basis points during the quarter, which was 7 basis points better than at year end.","Overall, we continue to be pleased with the positive trending of our asset quality. We expect future improvements to be driven by residential loans, as the commercial and consumer portfolios are already at or near normalized levels. As we look to the second quarter specifically, we expect net charge-offs to remain relatively stable within the context of an overall declining trend.","Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loans declined modestly compared to the prior quarter. You'll recall that late last year, we sold about $2 billion of guaranteed student and mortgage loans. Those sales occurred fairly evenly throughout the fourth quarter, so they resulted in about $1 billion average balance decline in the first quarter. Non-guaranteed mortgages and home equity also declined by about $800 million combined. These declines were partially offset by $1.1 billion of C&I growth due primarily to the average balance effects associated with the increased borrowing activity by a client in December, as well as some ongoing growth in the portfolio during this quarter.","Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were essentially stable. Growth in targeted categories included C&I, which increased by $4.2 billion or 9% and indirect loans, which were also up by 9% or $900 million. This growth was offset by the guaranteed loan sales and declines in home equity and commercial real estate.","Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were relatively stable as compared to the fourth quarter. Growth in money market, NOW and savings totaled $1.6 billion or 2%, and this was offset by ongoing reductions at higher cost time deposits, as well as the seasonal decline in DDA. Relative to the prior year, deposits were up another $1.8 billion or 1%. However, the mix shift remains the bigger story with lower cost balances up $5 billion or 5%. This was driven primarily by a $2.7 billion or 8% DDA increase. Concurrently, higher cost time deposits declined by $3.2 billion or 18%.","Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital expanded by approximately $300 million, and the Tier 1 common ratio again increased up to an estimated 10.1%. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are implemented in their current form is 8.2%.","As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share also increased, both driven by higher shareholders' equity due to our current quarter's earnings.","I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. So -- and before we move into Q&A, what I thought I'd do is share some of the highlights from a line of business perspective. We'll start with our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management business. So net income in the segment was up $43 million or 78% over last year driven by credit quality improvement and a reduction in noninterest expenses, which more than offset some of the predicted lower revenue. We also introduced a service to -- asset -- excuse me, asset quality continued to improve most notably in home equity portfolio, which drove a significant decline in our provision for credit losses. Furthermore, expenses were down 8% from last year. Clients are increasingly using our self-service channels. Mobile application sign-ons are up 300-plus percent. ATM deposits are up almost 200% over the past 2 years. This has given us the opportunity to make some changes to our staffing model and more recently, to our retail branch network. But I'll point out importantly that we're implementing these changes while also maintaining our industry-leading client loyalty. We also have numerous initiatives underway to improve performance, and we made progress on several fronts this quarter.","Consumer loan production was up year-over-year, and our efforts to drive further growth included the first quarter launch of an online origination platform, which targets super prime clients and a simplified home refinance product designed to generate new business. We also introduced a service to attract new retail clients by making the process of switching banks much easier. Oftentimes, clients are reticent to change banks due to the arduous nature of the process, and we've eliminated that deterrent with this new service, and we're off to a good start.","Now let's take a closer look at the progress in our wholesale business this quarter. On Slide 14, we see that our wholesale business delivered net income growth of 44% for the prior year. Continued credit improvement in our CRE portfolio drove a substantial decrease in provision for credit losses. Furthermore, expenses were down 13% over last year. These items helped offset lighter revenue for the quarter, as modest growth and net interest income was offset primarily by lower trading revenue. You'll notice that the efficiency ratio for this segment continued to improve. We ended the quarter with a tangible efficiency ratio of 52%, down 6 percentage points from last year. I'll also point out that we had good loan growth, and it was diversified across most of our industry segments.","Wholesale is a key segment for us and one that we intend to keep -- continue growing. As such, we've got several initiatives underway, and I'll spend a moment articulating some of this progress. We continue to grow lead relationships in our corporate investment banking business. Since January of 2012, we've increased our lead syndicated relationships 18% to levels that are more than double what they were at the beginning of 2010. We've had great talent expansion that continued this quarter with the hiring of key sector experts in some of our main industry verticals. In the commercial line of business, we saw a year-over-year growth in new business revenue per relationship manager and generated positive momentum in deepening client relationships. Furthermore, we saw our pipeline for commercial loans rebuild throughout the first quarter, following a strong funding that occurred at the end of the fourth quarter. A key component of growing our wholesale business is a multi-year strategy in Treasury & Payments Solutions where we are improving products, platforms and delivery channels in an effort to enhance the marketability and profitability of this product suite.","To that end, during the first quarter, we launched a new and improved small business online platform, which introduced new features and improved online experience for over 200,000 existing clients. In CRE, loan balances grew sequentially, and production was up nearly 50% from last year. We also have a healthy pipeline to generate continued growth from here, evidencing our growing momentum in client acquisition activity as our targeted new business approach matures.","Now let's take a look at mortgage. Our mortgage business moved closer to profitability this quarter, as our legacy issues continue to abate with ongoing improvements in credit quality and lower expenses. As Aleem detailed, we saw a decline in gain on sale this quarter off of the high levels we experienced last year. Despite that decline, the profitability on new originations is solid, and we're continuing to position this business for long-term success.","We've added origination capacity to take advantage of the opportunities that the mortgage market affords, opportunities, which I think are particularly prevalent in our footprint, which is HARP rich and has seen continued and widespread improvements in the housing market. Our capacity additions have been concentrated in consumer direct, which is a convenient channel for our clients, as well as the most profitable for SunTrust. This enabled us to increase our HARP 2.0 outbound calling efforts, and we saw benefits from this with HARP applications up by about $450 million sequentially after falling slightly in the last 2 quarters. Closed loan volume in consumer direct was more than double the prior year, and it generated more than 15% of our first quarter applications. Overall production volume this quarter was $8.8 billion, the highest level since the third quarter of 2009. While first quarter industry market share statistics aren't yet available, I suspect that when they are, they'll show that we gained share as our capacity additions enabled us to improve turn times on our application pipeline, be more proactive in our outbound calling efforts and grow our correspondent channel. We currently expect these factors as well as an improving purchase market to drive another strong quarter of production volume in the second quarter.","In sum, our franchise offers a lot of potential. We see meaningful opportunities in our business segments to leverage our distinct position within each, and we prioritize initiatives to help us capitalize on those opportunities. But most importantly, we're seeing real evidence of the progress that we've been making. Our core earning trends have been favorable, and our credit quality has substantially improved. I'm also pleased with the progress that we've made on our efficiency ratio, and I can assure you the focus there remains high. Concurrent with this, we've had some tailwinds as we anticipate meaningful year-over-year improvements in our especially high cost -- our cyclically high cost and credit metrics. We have the benefit of an improving housing markets and employment in our footprint as the southeast appears to be recovering at a faster pace than the rest of the country. And our business mix provides diversity of revenue, which I think is key for sustainable long-term growth.","Now with all that said, Kris, I'll turn it back over to you, and we can take some Q&A.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Bill. Wendy, we're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little more color on loan demand in the quarter particularly around -- I know you mentioned the pipeline picked up but also the trend in commitments and line utilization as well on the commercial side?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, the -- I mean, you pointed out we really did see, over the course of the quarter, the pipeline starting to increase and refill from the fourth quarter. Where we end the quarter is a pretty robust pipeline compared to what we've seen in the past, so we feel good about that. On the utilization, the utilization is slightly higher this quarter than the trends but down from the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter was obviously up in utilization, but it is a little bit better than sort of the prior quarters', multi-quarters' average. And then commitments are up slightly as well. So part of the forward look is the pipeline's built, utilization's okay, and the -- we have seen an increase in commitments as well.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the environmental cost side, can you talk to us a little bit more about the credit-related cost trend going from -- going forward from here? You saw a nice decline in those costs on the operating losses and the credit-related expenses, and it seemed to imply in your prepared comments that we shouldn't expect material declines in a couple of those areas going forward. So can you just kind of wrap it all together in terms of the overall outlook for environmental costs in the next several quarters?","William Henry Rogers","Maybe I'll take it a high level, and then, Aleem, you can embellish with mine. But we've -- remember, we talked about setting a target for those costs or trying to talk about those costs in general sort of being in the $325 million range, plus or minus. And clearly, the first quarter was below that. And I think sort of similar to the comments on the efficiency ratio, we feel just much more solid about that number on an ongoing basis. As Aleem pointed out, some costs like OREO being 0, they'll come back to some level. Some level, that'll be below where it was in the past. Those costs now are primarily sort of CRE related. We've sort of run through a lot of that, so the backlog is not very substantial, but you'll see that bumpy as it goes through. Our collection expense is going to continue to grind down, and we've seen that pretty consistently now, and that will continue to be on a quarter-by-quarter grind-down basis. Probably not as fast as we'd all hope because we've got some issues, as you know, in Florida and takes slower, but I'm confident that we're on the right flight path of grinding those down. Aleem, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.","Aleem Gillani","Sure. So John, yes, we had -- you're right. We've previously guided to $325 million sort of plus or minus $50 million for that line, and I'm more confident that it's in the minus now. So we're clearly on the right track. Bill pointed out OREO. Let me give you just a little color on OREO. The reason it was 0 this quarter is we actually had some gains on sale that offset some of the regular activity there. So wouldn't expect a 0 again, but you, clearly, also wouldn't expect the sort of $50 million run rate-type number that you saw in the past. And then on the operating cost number, that can be lumpy, right? In any given quarter, we might get a regulatory assessment or a legal accrual or a specific operating loss. That number can be lumpy up and down. And in the fourth quarter, we had an accrual in there, which we lost this quarter. So you're going to see some ups and downs, but I think the $325 million minus guidance is probably the better place to think about this.","Operator","The next question is from Keith Murray with Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Could you just walk me through the $119 million reduction in the mortgage repurchase reserve? You mentioned resolution activity. Just what specifically was that? And could there be more coming down the pipeline?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. Keith, the mortgage repurchase reserve is -- the way we put that together quarter-by-quarter is we take a look at all the demands that we get coming in from the GSEs, and we evaluate those by sort of delinquency rate, severity, vintage and model what we think our sort of total cost is going to be in the future. We've actually provided, I think, some really good transparency in the past around our modeling process and how that number is put together. Back in the third quarter, we put in place a relatively high provision and raised the size of the reserve to what we thought would be sufficient to cover all of the repurchases from the GSEs for pre-2009 loans. And now as we're going through resolution activity with the GSEs after making that large onetime provision and contribution to the reserve, those resolutions are now drawing down on the reserve on a regular quarterly basis. So I would expect to see the reserve continue to decline over time as we continue to resolve the GSE demands.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just a question, when you're talking about the impact of the net interest margin from the swap income, is there an offset from the $7 billion or so of CDs that mature this year? Is that baked into your thoughts there?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, we -- yes, but over the course of the next 3 quarters, we've got about $4 billion of CDs maturing, and we expect to get a little bit of benefit from that as some of those clients will probably not renew into ongoing run rate CDs but may keep their money a little bit shorter term. But we also have about another $4 billion of CDs maturing in the first 3 quarters of next year. And next year, those CDs that are rolling off are actually at relatively high rates, and we expect to get some benefit from that, too. So overall, we are going to keep trying to grind down deposit rates and manage our liability costs, but I don't expect to get much of a benefit from the CDs maturing this year, more so next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Levin with Citi.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask on the -- when you think about home prices and home price appreciation, what are you thinking about in terms of how you model internally when you think about reserve release or provision? I mean, how might that drive future reserve release?","Thomas E. Freeman","If you can hear me all right, I've got a bit of cold so -- I don't have this deep a baritone. It's Tom Freeman. The -- we model losses on a zip code-by-zip code, house-by-house kind of basis. So we'll go into the individual zip codes. We will take housing price appreciation, include that into the modeling activity, and as housing prices continue to increase, then future losses, we would expect would decline somewhat. But it hasn't gotten so robust in terms of housing prices that we still don't have captured losses within the portfolio. But it will mitigate somewhat but would have to rise fairly substantially really to have a significant impact on the release of the reserve.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on loan growth, some of your competitors have talked about seeing increasing competition no longer is on price but term and now structure. Are you seeing that as well?","William Henry Rogers","Absolutely. And I think -- and you can see it in the yields in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. This has been a sort of last 90 days of pretty aggressive market both on pricing as well as structure. I don't think we're in sort of the red zone yet in terms of either one of those, and they're certainly not back where they were sort of precrisis level, but it is something that we're paying a lot of attention to. We're probably more competitive on the pricing side than we are the structure side in terms of sort of where we choose to compete. But clearly, there has been a shift here in the last quarter.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is that -- sorry, it's a follow-up question to that. Is that shift in the last quarter, is that based on people -- sort of banks becoming desperate to deploy capital? Or is it a sense that the market's really turning and they want to be there and want to set their foothold now?","William Henry Rogers","Well, I think it's sort of a supply and demand. I mean, there is not as much demand, and there's a lot of supply. So I think that just the basic economic forces are out there. We, obviously, given our -- everybody's respective funding, there's just a lot of capacity to add assets onto the balance sheet. So I think that's more of it. We'll have to see. I mean, if you look at sort of the last 3 years, you sort of see the first 2 quarters have generally been slower in loan growth and the last 2 quarters have generally been better. And so if that supply-and-demand equation changes, we might see some leveling out in terms of spreads and structure.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some more color on the decline in the mortgage business, how much of the impact was seasonal? And I know -- as you mentioned in your remarks, Aleem, I know it's hard to predict the path of gain-on-sale from here, but do you expect to see a stabilizing around these levels? Or could we even see a bit of improvement as we enter the spring selling season? And it seems like most of the volume increase was correspondent. Are you seeing an opportunity to get more aggressive in that area?","Aleem Gillani","As you said, Ryan, it's pretty hard to forecast the quarter from 2 weeks. But if I try, and this is a risky thing to do, understand, we did see a stabilizing in March on gain-on-sale spreads. It looks like investors in MBS paper are once again coming back into the market and perhaps starting to pay up again for pools that have good prepayment characteristics. So if you accept an extrapolation of 2 weeks for a full quarter, it does look like gain-on-sale overall has stabilized, yes.","William Henry Rogers","And Ryan, just also if we think then about the other part of your question on sort of the shift in the business -- again, a couple of questions in there, and I'll try to tackle all of them. But the closed loan first quarter was about 80% refinance and about 20% purchase. The application volume so I think go forward is about 70% refinance and about 30% purchase. So we're starting to see a little bit of that shift. I think part of it, seasonal as you talked about. You saw the purchase volumes are usually a little lower in the first quarter, and you start to see it come back. But I think more importantly for us, it's really evidence of what we're seeing as a recovery in our markets. I mean, I think this is where we get the benefit. And you know SunTrust well. I mean, we've always been a strong purchase-oriented mortgage business, so this shift for us is not a 90-degree turn where we have to sort of redeploy different assets and different people. Our loan officers, as an example, I mean, they were -- our purchase experience with loan officers, we were rated #1 by J.D. Power. So this isn't a new phenomenon for us, and we're actually excited about the opportunity on purchase because I think it gives a good signal to what's happening in our markets. You also asked about correspondent, and correspondent's also always been a big part of our business. So we've always had sort of a multi-pronged strategy to our business. Correspondent was part of our growth. The fact that we built capacity in our consumer direct to handle a lot of the HARP volume actually allowed us to handle more correspondent volume and do it on the kind of basis that they expect with good turnarounds and good product and high SLAs that we want to commit to with our correspondent business. So I also do see that as a potential opportunity. But again, it's not new to us. This is business that we've been in.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Given there's a lot now, I'll just give you one quick follow-up.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Did I get them all?","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","You did. You did. Aleem, you mentioned moderate increases in core expenses for 2Q, and I know both you and Bill highlighted potential for cyclically high costs to continue to come down. So can you give us the puts and takes of how you think about the entire expense base? Should we see core expense inflation at the same time that cyclically high costs are also coming down? So should we actually see the path of expenses continue to decline from here of the overall base?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think, Ryan, what we're really focused on sort of more than just the expense number in and of itself is the efficiency ratio. So you're stepping back and looking at the company overall, that's really what we try to focus on. And to try to manage the efficiency ratio down, you're seeing traction there this quarter, but you're also seeing that we expect over the medium term to get to much lower efficiency ratios overall. And those are tied to lots of initiatives. We've heightened things like pay-for-performance standards. We've tightened up a lot of the processes. We've eliminated duplication. And just day-to-day management of costs are much, much tighter. So in any one quarter -- and I think next quarter, you might see a little bit of a move up in the expense line overall but overall, I think if you think about expenses being tied to revenue and think about us managing the overall efficiency ratio down and managing the company better.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you talk about the core NIM outlook? You gave us obviously good detail on the swaps and just mentioned there's some underlying NIM pressure as we're seeing everywhere, but did you talk about the magnitude of that core NIM pressure going forward?","Aleem Gillani","No, I didn't specifically, Matt. As I think about NIM in the near term that there is going to be compression. We do have some more assets rolling off. This low-rate environment continues to affect us and, as you pointed out, we've got some swap roll-off coming up also. If I think about what NIM looks like, I think about sort of generally as we've guided before, it's sort of a handful or so of basis points by quarter every quarter. Some -- and not in a straight line but averaged out over time. It's sort of a handful of basis points per quarter and then in Q2, an additional 3 basis point drag because of the swap roll-off.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And sorry to try and box you in on this, but what exactly is a handful? Are you talking like a few basis points or...","Aleem Gillani","Well, as I said, it's hard to say, Matt, quarter-by-quarter. But over time, if you think about some kind of a number on an annual basis, that might be -- I'm going to make this up now, 20 basis points per year. That translates to a handful per quarter on average. But again, don't take it quarter-by-quarter. It's a long-term process.","Operator","The next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a question, I guess, on your capital priorities and you all mentioned the buyback and the increase in the dividend. We estimate that, that gets you to about a 25% total payout ratio this year. How -- can you give us any glide path in terms of the timing potentially to get to a 60% to 80% payout ratio. Is that potentially next year? Or is that further off in the future as you see things today?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I hate to take a step back on this question, but that's sort of -- a lot of that depends on the CCAR process. You know how the process works and the guidance that all the banks received this year in the process I think was similar to the guidance we received last year. Think about a dividend payout ratio not exceeding 30%, and then on top of that, buybacks starting to layer in. And we're delighted to be able, this year, to be able to, as a result of the process, actually recommend to our board a dividend increase, as well as the commencement of our buyback program. So we're happy with how that went this year, and over time, we do expect to layer that in. But the way that the timing works is really dependent on what the CCAR process looks like over the next year or 2 and how much regulators allow increased payouts.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. And I think, I mean, we clearly stated, I mean, this year was a shift. I mean, I think we -- you obviously saw what we did. We spent a considerable amount of time de-risking, for lack of better word, our balance sheet, building a lot of earnings momentum, ending the year with a really high capital position. But we stated early in the process that we were going to be conservative in the capital adds because we were shifting. As we gain more confidence and we continue to build earnings momentum and capital and strength in our credit quality, we'll get more on that path that you talked about. But as Aleem said, it's just hard year-to-year to sort of say where you're going to land because we've got an important process to go through.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess as my follow-up, another relatively bigger picture question. Bill, you had mentioned some successes in moving the branch or the retail banking business towards more e-banking, less sort of traditional focus on face-to-face transaction-oriented business. I guess, I'm curious as you think about the longer-term efficiency ratio target, how much of that do you think is going to have to come from branch rationalization and what are the opportunities there over the next few years given your focus, your greater focus on electronic banking.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, and we don't really think about that as a percent of the total efficiency ratio improvement so -- because all the pieces move together. So I'd talk about that in terms of the efficiency side, but I probably don't talk about as much about what's going on in the branch on the revenue side of the things that we're trying to increase as the branch turns less of a service center, which is clearly happening. I mean, no doubt about that trend is underway, but we're putting more emphasis on turning that branch into a sales center. Our -- if you look at our -- we call it needs met. You'd call it sales per, but our needs met per unit is up about 25%. So the things that we're doing to try to increase that penetration and increase the revenue side, we're starting to see some legs on. So a lot of that will depend on the success and the trajectory of that. We also have a couple of new products that we've launched. The Switch Kit I talk about, it's an important piece. So we're going to manage the efficiency ratio of that unit pretty tightly, and it'll be the 2 components, both the revenue side and the expense side. The total program on branches is about 2% of our deposit base right now, so -- and we're retaining -- our trend is we'd like to retain something like 90% to 95% of the deposit base and the client base. We've got this significant advantage for us in that we've got pretty dense branch penetration in key markets. So our experience to date is actually sort of well in excess of that, so that will also depend on sort of how successful we are in retaining the deposits. So I'm not dodging your question other than to say a lot of factors go into it. And I think declaring the death of the branch would be way early. I think that would be a mistake for anybody to sort of reach that conclusion that will, tomorrow will be a digital bank and completely different from what we are today. I just think these are trends that we're watching and making sure that we're reacting to appropriately.","Aleem Gillani","And Matt, I think that while we manage all of our distribution channels, it's important to realize that they work in concert. Our branches remain meaningful to many of our clients going forward across all segments. And as we're investing in our virtual presence, we're also continuing to invest in our physical presence. It's not that we're only removing branches. We continue to invest in branches and our physical presence where it makes sense, but we try to combine both the physical nature of our business as well as the virtual nature.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Aleem, I was wondering if you can talk a little bit through some of the mix shift that you saw and you alluded to, especially the movement it looks like of cash back into the securities portfolio. Can you talk a little bit about just kind of what part of the quarter did you reinvest in? How much of that was in the run rate? And is there some benefit from that also as we look ahead?","Aleem Gillani","Ken, are you asking about how smart we were and when we invested?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","You could answer it that way.","Aleem Gillani","We did put a little bit of money back into the securities book this quarter, and we had generated some cash, you'll recall, in the third and fourth quarter, and we were sitting on a fair bit of excess liquidity as a result of the loan sales. So we did put some of that back to work. If you look at the -- pick a curve -- a 10-year swap curve over the course of the first quarter, you'll see that it rose over the course of the first couple of months, sort of rose in March and then fell off again right at the end of the quarter. Ken, you'll be delighted to know that we invested in March, not in January or February, so we sort of caught the -- our investments were towards the higher end of yields, and it was an opportunistic investment. We saw the move up. We thought it was a good time, and we were able to spend money, I think, in the right place. And just so you have these numbers, that left our investment portfolio unrealized gain at about $0.75 billion at quarter end and left us with an unrealized gain on the swap book of about another $600 million also.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that's all a net benefit, but it still gets overpowered by the core compression that you alluded to earlier?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. That's a long-term trend, and we're, like everybody else, working against that as best as we can.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My second question is just about fees and aggregates. You've talked through investment banking coming off of a really high quarter and we -- and obviously, the mortgage stuff. But is this a new base for mortgage banking -- I mean, for fees overall? And what do you see as the growth drivers coming off of this level of fees?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think about fees overall across the company. I think that we've got some opportunities to grow income in other places. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management business, I think there are opportunities to grow that business overall and the service charges and card fees that come from that business, as well as what we might be able to do in mortgage over time.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, remember, in some of the businesses, I mean, we're actually ending sort of a negative trend. So you think about us for sort of some of the card-related trends, it was $300 million that are sort of running themselves through. So we're sort of at the end of that cycle and starting on a more positive cycle. And I talked about core sales per FTE per day being up, products that we're introducing, things that we're doing, penetration of existing client base. So I don't accept the fact that we've sort of set a new low bar for fees. I see lots of opportunities in our franchise and virtually all the businesses that we're in for longer-term growth of the businesses, particularly as we run through some of these negative tailwinds, not the least of which was the economy and the markets in which we operate. And we're clearly seeing those trend more positively, so I see actually a lot of potential on the upside for fees long term.","Operator","Our final question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On housing, I just wanted to understand -- you mentioned earlier that HPI is moving up, and you think that it's accelerating in your footprint beyond what's going on in the rest of the country. So maybe you can just help us understand how that is impacting your loan growth prospects not just for housing but also for other loan categories. Is it faster and some of those faster recovery markets would be helpful to understand? And in addition, could you give us a progress on the judicial backlog in Florida and how you see that trajecting?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, maybe I'll make some sort of high-level comments and then we'll add to that however you want to. But -- and it's hard to sort of pinpoint. You get 5% increase in housing, then it translates to X. So the R-squared is actually sort of not that correlated to different things. But if you think about sort of the what happens in the psychology of housing increases in our markets. Some of our markets, think Florida, was at one time 40%-plus of the population on their home was underwater on their mortgage. Well, if you're underwater on your mortgage, you're not going to invest in your house. You're not going to buy a new dishwasher. You're not going to buy a new car. So all those things that go along with sort of the psychology of being underwater. So part of it is you just feel more confidence that translates into those markets. And as I said, certainly R-squared's not perfect. But we're seeing that and feeling that in some of our consumer activity, some of our consumer production. Home equity production is up. I mean, we're starting to see those kind of things that translate from an increase in home prices. And then back to mortgage specifically, you actually just create markets that didn't exist. So purchase markets will start to come. People feel better about investing in new home construction, and those kinds of things will start to happen. People will move to places that they wouldn't have moved to before because they feel like there's a brighter economy. So it has a real positive impact across the franchise in lots of places. It's just hard to sort of very specifically pinpoint where it is. There was a follow-up question which [indiscernible] ...","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, well, follow-up is just if you could talk a little bit about how the backlog in Florida is trending in line with prior expectations. Or is that at all moving a little bit more rapidly? And then if you could touch also on your outlook for CRE in your footprint, as well as nationally. Been hearing that you're expanding your CRE efforts into a nationwide effort. Could you just give us some color on that, if that's accurate?","William Henry Rogers","Yes. The time line for foreclosure in Florida is about the same. So we'd like that to be better, but it's about the same. And that's unfortunately a good time [ph]. The NPLs are actually down, so we're putting less on top of the pipeline, but the pipeline, the things that are in there are taking about the same amount of time to run themselves through. As it relates to what's going on in CRE, I think we're sort of at an important inflection point where the runoff of the existing portfolio is about to be offset by the production in the upside. And keep in mind, we start off a pretty low base, about $5 billion, but we're -- I think I mentioned we had about a 50% increase in production. So we're -- that runoff is about to stop, and we're starting to see some of the increase in potential. It'll take a while. I mean that's not going to be a next quarter thing, but in terms of long-term potential, that's pretty positive.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Any expansion plans outside of just your own footprint in CRE?","William Henry Rogers","Oh, yes. Yes, I mean, we're viewing this as an opportunity nationally. I mean, we sort of look at a heat map across the country. While most of our expansion will be -- have concentration in our particular -- a particular market as we do business with some of the national REITs and national homebuilders and sort of higher-quality, well-capitalized companies that we're working with, we won't be geographically bound by our own market. I mean, I think that's part of that key diversity strategy of our portfolio is actually not to be concentrated by product, by geography, as we really want to have a much more diversified portfolio going forward.","Aleem Gillani","And Betsy, you've seen us execute that successfully in our corporate investment banking business with a national footprint. And our CRE business I think can capitalize well on that success. I do want to come back for a moment to Matt O'Connor's question. I'm getting concerned that you all are going to take my handful of basis points and extrapolate that out forever. And obviously, that's not going to be the case. At some point, fixed-rate assets will stop repricing downward, and so I would really think about this as a handful of basis points this quarter plus 3 as opposed to assume less 20 basis points per year forever.","Kris Dickson","All right.

I'll begin this morning with a high level overview of the quarter, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to discuss the results in more detail. Following Aleem\u2019s comments, I'll review our performance at the segment level and wrap up with my perspectives on 2014 as a whole.","Throughout the year we made significant progress on several fronts, continue to expense discipline and further improvement in credit quality, help to offset the impact of the sustained low rate environment on revenues and translated into core earnings growth and lower adjusted tangible efficiency ratio. Our performance in the fourth quarter continued that momentum.","Reported earnings per share for the quarter were $0.72 on net income of common of $378 million. This quarter\u2019s results included a $145 million legal provision to both resolve and reserve for legacy mortgage matters. We remain focused on resolving these matters in a prudent fashion and this quarter\u2019s accrual was another step in the right direction. Excluding the legal provision adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 up 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year.","Total revenue was up modestly relative to the prior quarter. Net interest income was essentially flat as it has been in prior quarters with solid loan and deposit growth offset by continued margin compression. Non-interest income was up 2% sequentially driven primarily by higher mortgage related income and good performance in investment banking. Adjusted expenses were generally stable to the prior quarter, however down a full 7% compared to the prior year driven by continued expense reduction efforts, lower cyclical cost and the sale of RidgeWorth.","Importantly for the full year we reduced our expense base from 2013 as adjusted expenses were down nearly $200 million or 4% year-over-year. Accordingly we met our efficiency ratio goal with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year well below the target we set at the beginning of the year. Given our out performance in 2014 and the real revenue headwinds we faced in 2015 further progress in the short-term becomes much more challenging. However, we are committed to delivering further efficiency improvement this year albeit modest to stay on track to achieve our primary long-term goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio.","Moving to the balance sheet average performing loans were up 2% on a sequential basis and 6% year-over-year with continued momentum in C&I, commercial real estate and consumer. Deposit growth improved this quarter up 4% sequentially and 7% compared to the prior year. A portion of this growth is seasonal and temporary in nature, but our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum driven by better execution and enhanced capabilities.","Our credit quality continue to improve with NPLs down 17% and net charge-offs declining 11 basis points compared to the third quarter both reaching new multi-year lows, while improving economic conditions have played a role in our strong asset quality performance this is also was the result of significant actions we\u2019ve taken over the past several years to both de-risk and diversify our balance sheet and improve the quality of our production. Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from the previous quarter with Tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on our Basel III basis.","So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the financials.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us as we wrap up 2014 and look forward to 2015. Before I begin my review of this quarter, I\u2019ll remind you that our 2013 and 2014 reported results are impacted by certain non-core items the details of which are included in the appendix of our earnings presentations and release. These items can skew both quarterly and annual comparisons and therefore I will primarily focus on adjusted results to make the core trends more clear.","Earnings per share in the fourth quarter were $0.72 including a $145 million legal provision related to previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters which reflects increase legal reserves and the final settlement of a specific matter. This legal accrual was recorded as we made further progress on certain matters in the fourth quarter accordingly based on what we know today we would expect our reasonably possible legal losses in excess of reserves to decline by a roughly similar amount.","Excluding the impact of this provision adjusted earnings per share were $0.88 which were 9% higher than the prior quarter and 14% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was driven by higher non-interest income, a lower provision for credit losses and a slightly lower effective tax rate. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year earnings growth was driven by a 7% reduction in adjusted expenses, higher mortgage-related revenue and a lower provision expense which together more than offset the loss of income from RidgeWorth.","For the full year adjusted earnings per share increased 18% compared to 2013 as solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and improved asset quality more than offset a reduction in mortgage production income and a 17 basis point decline in the net interest margin.","Let\u2019s review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was stable relative to the prior quarter as solid loan growth offset the effective margin compression. Net interest margin declined 7 basis points due to the decline in commercial loan swap income and lower securities yields which resulted from higher premium amortization as MBS cash flows increased.","Core C&I loan yields excluding swap income were relatively stable compared to the prior quarter. However, we expect further compression in this asset class given the competitive landscape and low interest rate environment. As we have said before loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower however, the C&I business often brings with it additional non-interest income and deposit revenue opportunities. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients\u2019 needs and therefore maintain a disciplined focus on overall returns.","On a year-over-year basis net interest income was also stable as 8% average earning asset growth offset the 24 basis points of margin compression. Looking at the full year net interest margin declined more than we had anticipated at the beginning of last year as wholesale banking loan growth was stronger than expected and yields continued to compress. In addition, the yield curve flattened significantly in 2014 with ten-year rates declining 80 to 90 basis points from already low levels.","Looking forward, we expect first quarter net interest margin to decline approximately seven to nine basis points from the current level driven primarily by lower commercial loan swap income. In addition, all things being equal, net interest income will decline by approximately $50 million from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, given lower commercial loan swap income and too fewer days coming up.","We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment. While also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.","Moving on to slide six, adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by higher investment banking and mortgage related income. Investment banking income increased $21 million due to higher syndicated finance and M&A revenues. Mortgage production income increased $16 million on improved gain on sale margins and high refinance activity both as a result of lower rates in the quarter.","Mortgage servicing income increased $8 million sequentially as a result of a larger servicing portfolio and higher seasonal payment activity in the fourth quarter. Trust and investment management income was down $9 million compared to the prior quarter driven primarily by certain seasonal and nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. In addition, service charges for deposits declined $7 million, again largely driven by seasonal trends.","Lastly, we incurred $5 million of net securities losses in the quarter resulting from a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income decreased $15 million due to the loss of RidgeWorth fee income, partially offset by an increase in mortgage related revenue. Finally, full year non-interest income excluding this gain on sale of RidgeWorth and its associated revenues was up 4% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we\u2019re creating in our CIB business, as well as retail investment services, private wealth and credit card.","Moving to Slide 7, adjusted non-interest expense which excludes the impact of the legal provision was stable to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $60 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable for the full year, incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2014, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Outside processing and software costs increased $22 million due to higher utilization of third party services in addition to normal quarterly variability.","Other non-interest expense increased $26 million due primarily the higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter. Adjusted cyclical costs were stable to the prior quarter and down $32 million relative to the prior year. Going forward we do not anticipate these costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base, with the exception of occasional variability in operating losses.","Compared to the fourth quarter of last year adjusted non-interest expense was down 7%, driven by a combination of our efficiency efforts lower cyclical costs and the sale of RidgeWorth. For the full year adjusted expenses were down 4% compared to 2013 and a full 14% compared to 2011. As we look to the first quarter we currently anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical increase in 401(k) and 5(k) expenses and also will return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefits costs.","Bigger picture on an annual basis we do not expect core expenses to decline from the 2014 level given our revenue goals. However our main focus is on the efficiency ratio and thus we will calibrate our expense base against the revenue environment.","As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.4% from 61.9% in the prior quarter, as we delivered both modest revenue growth and a slight decline in adjusted expenses. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 63%. 230 basis points lower than 2013 despite the significant headwinds from lower mortgage volumes and declining net interest margin. In 2015 our goal is to slightly improve upon last years 63% adjusted tangible efficiency ratio.","As Bill noted earlier progress in 2015 will be significantly more difficult than 2014 for a few reasons. First we\u2019re excepting commercial loan swap income to decline by $185 million, which represents a 150 basis point headwind to our efficiency ratio. Second as discussed on the previous slide our core expenses have declined significantly over the past few years and we do not anticipate further declines. And lastly, having achieved a better than projected result in 2014 we are now starting from a lower base than previously expected.","Irrespective of the short-term trajectory, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60% and achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders.","Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, our asset quality performance continues to be strong, nonperforming loans declined another 17% sequentially. In small part due to a transfer of $38 million of nonperforming loans to help our sales status, but largely due to outflows that continue to exceed inflows. This significant reduction in the nonperforming loan portfolio was achieved in conjunction with the net charge-off ratio declining 11 basis points reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio along side modestly higher recoveries in the fourth quarter.","Our allowance for credit losses declined to $20 million sequentially that the continued improvement in the overall asset quality more than offset a reserve build in the wholesale banking segment to address uncertainty in the energy sector. While our energy and utilities clients are important to our overall CIB business they represent only 3.5% of our loan portfolio with 70% of the book in the utilities and power, midstream and downstream sectors, which are not as meaningfully impacted the commodity price volatility.","Total provision expense decreased $19 million sequentially due to lower net charge-offs, partially offset by the lower reserve release. Over the near-term we expect further the moderating declines in nonperforming loans primarily driven by the residential portfolio. Net charge-off ratios are unlikely to sustain themselves that these levels over the long-term that we are not expecting a significant increase in 2015 relative to 2014.","We also expect our loan loss provision expense in 2015 to be fairly stable to 2014. However, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determine by our rigorous quarterly review processes which are informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.","Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10, average performing loan growth was up 2% sequentially driven by continued momentum in our C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, partially offset by continued declines in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios. C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by both our corporate and commercial banking clients. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in both our institutional and regional businesses. Consumer loans were also higher due to growth in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect portfolios. During the quarter we sold $800 million of loans and transferred another $1.1 billion of loans to help our sales status.","The net gain or loss on the sales and transfers was immaterial. Collectively these transactions were part of our strategy to optimize our balance sheet and improve returns and going forward we will continue to opportunistically evaluate loan sales to further this strategy.","On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8 billion or 6% driven by broad based growth across most portfolios. End-of-period loans increased to the lower rate of $5.6 billion or 4% compared to the prior year as we conducted approximately $4 billion of loan sales in the second half of 2014. Our solid loan production performance reflects our execution of targeted growth incentives alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets.","Turning to deposit performance, average client deposits were up $4.7 billion or 4% compared to the prior quarter and 7% compared to the prior year driven by improved and broad based growth across all of our lines of business. While a portion of this growth is seasonal and will decline in the first quarter, the majority of the growth is core and reflects both investments we have made in client-facing platforms such as SummitView and our treasury and payment solutions offering and our overall increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposits needs. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by 4 basis points compared to the prior year.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remain relatively stable at 9.7% due to balance sheet growth. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year due primarily the growth in retained earnings.","During the quarter we issued $500 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock as part of a longer term process to optimize the mix between common and non-common Tier-1 capital. We also repurchased $110 million of common stock. The cumulative actions we\u2019ve taken to improve our risk and earnings profile combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels should help us to further increase capital returns to shareholders. We submitted our 2015 capital plan earlier this month and we\u2019ll have more to report on this matter in March. Lastly, as of year-end our liquidity coverage ratio continues to exceed the January 1, 2016 90% requirement.","With that I\u2019ll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","William H. Rogers","Great, thanks Aleem. And I\u2019ll draw your attention to Slide 13. In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management we continue to make progress on our core growth initiative while holding a lot on expenses. Looking at the numbers, net income declined 5% sequentially, but was up 13% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven primarily by higher provision expense, due to some moderating asset quality improvement.","Total revenue was essentially flat compared to the third quarter, but was up 3% year-over-year. Net interest income increased relative to both prior periods driven by continued growth in loans and deposits. Non-interest income was down sequentially due to seasonally higher income and certain nonrecurring fees earned in the third quarter. Year-over-year, non-interest income was up 3%, driven by growth in Wealth Management related income and card fees.","Average loans were up half a percentage point on a sequential basis with double digit growth and consumer direct partially offset by continued run-off in the home equity portfolio and certain loan sales during the quarter. Average deposits grew 3% sequentially reflecting our increased focus on meeting more of clients deposit needs particular in our affluent, high-net worth businesses.","Turning to the full year results, net income was up 7% driven by higher revenue and lower provision, partially offset by higher expenses. Total revenue increased 2% driven primarily by 6% growth in Wealth Management related fees which reflects our increased investment in people, tools, technology to better meet our client needs. These investments were the primary drivers of growth and expenses year-over-year.","The full year results in this business demonstrate good execution of the core strategic initiatives we\u2019ve outlined in the past. Improving Wealth Management related income, enhancing the growth and returns of our consumer lending portfolio and making critical investments in talent and technology. Heading in 2015, we want to continue our core revenue momentum. However, expense discipline will also remain important as we continue to balance cost reduction opportunities with selective investments for growth.","Turning to Slide 14, in our wholesale business, wholesale banking remains a key growth engine for the company and we continue that momentum in the business for the fourth quarter. While net income declined due to an increased provision expense, revenue increase compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Net interest income was up 5% sequentially and 11% compared to the fourth quarter of last year driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth.","Adjusted non-interest income declined 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year due to lower trading income and structured finance related fees. These trends were partially offset by higher investment banking revenue and particularly good performance given the market volatility in the fourth quarter.","Average loan balances were up 5% when compared to the prior quarter with growth across the entire platform, we\u2019d growth in almost all of our CIB verticals in addition to the momentum and core commercial real estate, national corporate banking and our specialty commercial groups in particular auto dealer and not-for-profit and government.","Loan yields remained under pressure constraining our margin however as we\u2019ve said before our risk adjusted return hurdles incorporate the entire client relationship which also includes deposits and fee income generation. For the full year client deposits increased 10% and capital markets related fees were up 9%.","Looking in our full year results adjusted net income increased 10% driven by solid revenue growth and lower provision, fees were up modestly as lower trading and leasing income combined with the exit of a legacy affordable housing partnership were more than offset by 13% growth and investment banking income. Our full year investment banking performance reflects broad-based growth with record, our new record results across debt and equity capital markets and M&A.","The success of our platform reflects our continued investment and talent to both expand and diversify our capabilities. This year we have been able to leverage our one team approach to better deliver our capital markets capability to not only our larger corporate client base, but also our core commercial banking and commercial real estate clients and that\u2019s a value proposition that\u2019s increasingly well received. Looking forward our pipelines remain healthy and I am confident that the wholesale organization has the momentum to drive further growth in 2015.","Shifting to mortgage adjusted net income in the mortgage segment increased $38 million on a sequential basis driven by growth and fee income and lower provision. In particular production related income was up $16 million due to higher volume and gain on sale margins as a result of lower interest rates. Servicing related income was up $9 million due to the recent servicing acquisitions and a seasonal increase in payments. Adjusted expenses were up 12% sequentially due in part to the increased plan activity of the quarter.","For the full year mortgage delivered core profitability driven by 35% reduction in core expenses. Revenue declined modestly as growth and net interest income was more than offset by decline in fee income. Core mortgage production income declined 47% year-over-year however mortgage servicing income more than doubled driven mainly by lower prepayments in the servicing portfolio in 2014. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined from triple digits in 2013 to 74% in 2014.","Over the past year our core mortgage business demonstrated significant improvement, this progress was driven by a lot of heavy lifting to normalize our cost base and improve our risk profile. Most of that is now complete and optimistic will be able to more firmly focus on the core strategies in place to meet more client needs, drive higher revenue and deliver incremental efficiency improvement.","Now before we begin the Q&A part of the call, I would like to take a moment to highlight our accomplishments during the year. So coming into 2014 we faced several meaningful revenue headwinds namely the end of the mortgage refi boom and the ongoing impact of prolong low rate environment on net interest margin. However, we remained focus on the commitments we made our stakeholders and we delivered on those goals.","For our clients we increased investments in people and enhance capabilities to better anticipate and serve their needs. For our teammates we invested more in training and opportunities to improve their own financial well being. For our local communities we continue to support economic growth through purposeful investments, active partnerships and volunteer commitments.","Our 2014 United Way campaign was the most successful in the company\u2019s history with teammates donating nearly $6.5 million and for our shareholders we delivered strong efficiency performance and a significant improvement in asset quality the result of which was 18% earnings growth and a 10 basis point improvement in ROI. In addition we more than doubled our capital return. Separately we were able to resolve several outstanding legacy mortgage matters and this quarters legal provision expenses in another important step in that process.","And then finally for all the teammates on this call, I would like to thank them for what they have done and continue to do to transform our company. We are unified in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and our communities, and in our ongoing drive for delivering improved performance for our shareholders.","So teammates thank you. And Ankur let me turn that back over to you.","Ankur Vyas","Okay, thanks Bill. Brad, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","William H. Rogers","Good morning, Matt.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I was wondering if you could elaborate on the strategy of trying to optimize the balance sheet by some of the loans that you are selling or moving to held-for-sale or just the kind of approach you are taking in terms of the criteria to evaluate the loans.","Aleem Gillani","Certainly, Matt. I guess the first criteria is whether these are single service clients or they\u2019re sort of multi-product clients and to the extent that they are single service clients that makes these loans more eligible for loans that we might be willing to sell. The second criteria is financial, we are looking at the overall return on that relationship and on that transaction and for lower ROA loans those are the ones that we would tend to look at first.","So in the context of our overall strategy which is the optimizing the entire balance sheet, looking at the risk profile of those loans and our balance sheet, think of this as sort of a continuation of the approach we\u2019ve actually taken over the last couple of years that continue to grow in terms of meeting all of our clients needs and also improve the financial performance and returns of the company.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then I guess segueing into just net interest income overall you gave pretty explicit guidance for 1Q, but as we think about all the moving pieces including some potential loan sales and obviously lower rates here, how would you think about the trajectory off of the 1Q level for the rest of 2015?","Aleem Gillani","Well, for net interest income overall as I think about the year, I think we are going to be treading water around that $1.2 billion type number, we continue to add terrific new business, we continue to grow the balance sheet with both new loans and getting deeper with our current clients, but the rate environment just continues to grind down and offset all of the benefits. So I think for a while we are just going to be treading water around that $1.2 billion level.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I mean just last follow-up, you talked about plans to grow revenue in your prepared comments, so obviously if net interest income is relatively flat, you are counting on fees, which categories or businesses do you think will be the key drivers?","William H. Rogers","Yes, Matt, the good news is we\u2019ve been making investments, so this is not sort of starting from sort of a flat surface and the places where we\u2019ve been making investments and we're seeing the results, and I\u2019ll name them sort of not necessarily in order but sort of go around the horn, what you have obviously seen continued progress in the investment banking part of our business and we\u2019ve added more capability there but we\u2019ve also expanded that reach within our company, so we\u2019ve seen now much more expanded fee generating capability out of our commercial business and out of our commercial real estate business the investments we\u2019ve made in corporate banking sort of around the country, you are starting to now see some of the fee generation that comes from that.","So there are lots of momentum builders in that business. Everything on the private wealth side has continued to have momentum, we\u2019re up about 6% there, we\u2019ve continued to invest in people, we\u2019ve continued to invest in technology, we're sort of net in hiring mode in that business, but we\u2019ve also done things like put premier bankers in our branches and they are going to really help, we\u2019ve given them a lot more data and a lot more analytics and they are really going to help us mine what we have as an already sort of bias to the affluent in our retail system and we're going to mine that better.","And then mortgage, so and it\u2019s great to mention mortgage on the positive side, we're going to see some movement there, we\u2019ve already seen here the first couple of days some refi activity, I would love to extrapolate the next two days across the rest of the year, I\u2019m not sure we can do that but we're starting to see some activity not only in the refinance side, but just sort of the core basic business in our retail markets as our markets improve. So there are a number of things, I mean those are sort of just three, but there are a number of things that we're investing in and credit card would be another on the smaller side in terms of fee generation.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan M. Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","William H. Rogers","Good morning Ryan.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning Ryan.","Ryan M. Nash","Aleem, I just wanted to make sure I got the message correct on expenses; I think this is now the second straight quarter. We did see expenses come below the 1.3 level; I think you averaged around 1.3 for the year. Given the fact that I know there are some seasonal elements to it, does the 1.3 to 1.35 level still hold and the reason I ask, it sounds like the revenue environment is marginally more challenging at this point in time, so I just want to get a sense of where you would expect expenses to fall out for the full year?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, Ryan I do think that full year expenses as I look at them today are going to be in that sort of $5.2 billion to $5.3 billion range for the year. But clearly as you point out, if they are revenue dependent and the revenue environment could move us out of that range either higher or lower and obviously as we look at overall expenses we\u2019re focused very much on the efficiency ratio. So as we think about what the revenue environment will be and how we adjust expenses against that revenue environment if you start off with a core expectation between $5.2 billion and $5.3 billion. And then think about we will adjust, we will calibrate that as revenues go up or down. Thinking about Q1 in this context, Q1 probably is up towards the top end of the quarterly range as a result of the normal seasonal effects.","Ryan M. Nash","Got, it. And then just putting all the guidance together do you still expect to grow earnings in 2015 from the 3.24 level?","Aleem Gillani","We are going to be targeting continued improvement at the Company. So whether that is efficiency ratio, whether that\u2019s earnings, whether that\u2019s returns we want to continue to make this company better over time.","Ryan M. Nash","Got it. I figure I had to take a shot. And I guess lastly Bill you talked about 3.5% energy exposure, but can you just give us a sense of energy exposure for the overall bank both from a lending perspective and from a fee income perspective. How is what we\u2019ve seen happen to energy prices impacting capital markets? And then from a consumer perspective are you starting to see the benefits of lower gas prices showing up in both consumer spending and willingness to borrow?","William H. Rogers","Yes, sure I\u2019ll try to hit all of those. I think Aleem, outlined the portfolio, it\u2019s about 3.5% of the portfolio and about 70% of that portfolio is really not significantly related to falling oil prices, think about 50% of portfolio is utility. So that sort of suffered a large part as midstream, that\u2019s just the transporting of oil from one place to another, that is not as impacted by prices as a much lower exposure and the E&P side and the oil field services side.","From a capital markets perspective and really also loan growth perspective, I mean energy has been an important part of what we do, we don\u2019t want to under mine that, but it\u2019s been sort of less than 10% of our loan growth. And the fee part of the business has been pretty consistent over the last several years. So this is not something that\u2019s been disproportionately part of the fee income business.","Did some of the fee business in the fourth quarter that was energy related not happen yes, that would be accurate and high yield markets sort of tightened up will some of that happen this year maybe. I think actually we\u2019re pretty well positioned, you remember we made a small acquisition of a company called Lantana which is in the advice business and while I think once sort of things level add a little bit probably sort to the later part of this year I think you\u2019re going to see a lot of activity actually in the energy side as people sort of reset and think about their structure.","As it relates to the consumer side I mean I think you sort of hit it accurately I mean relative to given the fact that we\u2019re not in a lot of the geographic markets that are going to be impacted more by a fall in oil prices well our consumers will see sort of that increase in tax refund equivalent of fall in oil prices. Have we seen it yet, I mean it might be too early I mean I\u2019ve looked closely at spending numbers and a credit card numbers and those kinds of things while they\u2019re marginally up its might be a little bit early to sort of see the total impact of that, but I have to believe that over the course of the year we\u2019ll see the most positive side for us arching much more towards the consumer side than the risk on the energy side.","William H. Rogers","Ryan, I\u2019d also point out that the vast majority of our corporate and commercial clients are in our footprint and they\u2019re going to also benefit from the drop in energy prices. So we\u2019ve got this clear differentiation between energy and consumer, but even within the corporate and commercial base our overall client base ought to do better with lower energy prices.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","William H. Rogers","Good morning, John.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, John.","John Pancari","On the expense side on the comp expense sorry if you\u2019ve already commented on it, but just want to get a little more color on the decline in the comp expense the drivers of it and how sustainable that decline is, is it all related to the efforts you\u2019ve been doing on the headcount side and the efficiencies and should we borrowing any typical seasonality, should we use this as a new base?","Aleem Gillani","Now let John, it\u2019s a little bit above, it\u2019s a little bit of we continue to get more efficient, but in addition we also had a reversal of some incentive accruals and actually for the year our medical costs came in lower than we were expecting our experience on that side ended that being a little bit better. So some of the benefit in the fourth quarter was a result of those and as I said earlier if I think about total comp expense I would increase that in Q1 about a $100 million relative to Q4 some of that for normal FICA\/401K seasonality and some of that just because we\u2019re starting from the lower number in the fourth quarter.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you. Sorry, I have to repeat that. And then on the commercial loan growth in the quarter just want to get some additional detail behind the drivers of the growth and then also your expectation around the C&I portfolio growth in coming quarters?","William H. Rogers","The good news John that\u2019s really, really broad based I mean we really saw - if you look at sort of the total year virtually every vertical that we\u2019re involved in on the C&I space group, so some in obviously different paces, but it reflects the diversity of our business mix, the investments that we\u2019ve made, it was fairly universal, it wasn\u2019t sort of in anyone particular place. We did see a little uptick in utilization, I don\u2019t want to sort of overplay that because quarter-to-quarter it can go up and down, but this quarter was up and up little more than we have seen in previous quarters. I think on balance that\u2019s a good thing, hopefully that reflects sort of more of that investment capital type of horn, but it was very broad based.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Mayo of CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you talk more about the efficiency if you striped out the known headwinds with the swaps, how much would you expect the core efficiency ratio to improve in 2015 and if we had to identify three of the reasons for the [indiscernible] efficiency what are you most focused on?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Mike, I think we\u2019re most focused on growing fee income and meeting more of our clients needs across everyone of our segments as well as connecting clients better across our businesses. So I think we have got, as Bill pointed out earlier, lots of opportunity in that space to continue to do better and the growth in that space along with a no lessening in our expense discipline I think will allow us to continue to improve our efficiency ratio in 2015 relative to where we ended up in 2014.","William H. Rogers","Yes, I think it\u2019s - I don\u2019t want anyone to think we are hedging it all on our commitment to our expense discipline, that commitment is in place, we\u2019ve created a lot of really positive momentum it continues. What we are balancing is the investment opportunity, so as we continue to achieve efficiency and expense saves, I want to make sure that we're also investing for the future and that\u2019s a delicate balance of walking and as Aleem mentioned, we\u2019ll calibrate. So we\u2019ll calibrate what's happening on the revenue side to the expense side that always does have work quarter-for-quarter and we're committed to continue to improve on the efficiency ratio.","Aleem Gillani","Mike, I don\u2019t want to make light of how hard this is going to be, this is really hard in 2014 we had $200 million of revenue headwinds, we fought our way through that and got better. In 2015 we're going to have another $200 million of revenue headwinds. So after doing it once, it gets harder to do it again, but we understand the task in front of us and we're going to be working hard to achieve it.","Mike Mayo","I mean the reason I asked the question, again I mean your efficiency ratio was 61.9 in the third quarter, 61.4 in the fourth quarter and your guidance which certainly is appreciated is for under 63%. So you are kind of already there. So on a headline basis it might be tough for us to figure out some of the ins and outs or can you break it out or?","William H. Rogers","Well I think that\u2019s an easy math.","Aleem Gillani","Yes, you have always have a seasonal impact.","William H. Rogers","Yes.","Aleem Gillani","Clearly what happens from the - just on the FICA and reset loan, I mean you have a significant reset in the first quarter, so there always is some seasonal impact and of course we're catching us at the best part of that seasonal impact.","William H. Rogers","Yes and don\u2019t forget the revenue headwind that starts now that starts in 2015 relative to the 2014 on the swaps. So we loved being able to deliver numbers that were 61 Mike, but we're starting 2015 in the tougher place.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Usdin","Hi thanks good morning.","William H. Rogers","Good morning Ken.","Kenneth Usdin","Aleem, I was wondering this quarter you didn\u2019t make many adjustments to that swap income portfolio ladder and just given where rates have gone and it changes - the macro view of when this head might move, how inclined are you to continue to continue to add to swaps in the future on top of what you have had done in the past.","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I think we continue to look at that very actively Ken through our ALCO process as you know we're continuing to do new loans, or continue to grow the business and those come on, the majority of those loans come on floating, so deciding whether to fix them or not is sort of part of overall balance sheet strategy and we did do a little bit in the fourth quarter, nothing overly substantial on that side, but we\u2019ll continue to manage the overall balance sheet duration and continue to be opportunistic to the extent that we can.","And if there are large moves one way or the other we\u2019ll consider that in our overall balance sheet strategy. In the fourth quarter we had some small action, in addition you saw the securities loss that was basically moving Level 2 HQLA into Level 1 to make sure that we continue to stay compliant under the LCR. So there are few of these sorts of minor little actions going on back and forth, but as we go through 2015 if there are opportunities that makes sense from a risk versus return trade off we\u2019ll continue to take those.","Kenneth Usdin","Okay, got it and a follow-up on the curve, just can you give us a flush out of context of where and how that the low ten-year affects your portfolio or not relative to peers in terms of if we stay here and the lower than expected or hope for ten-year, what parts of the portfolio should we be mindful off?","William H. Rogers","Yes. Well I don\u2019t know how it would affect us relative to peer, but when you look at us specifically the ten-year rate affects us in a couple of ways. Number one, it affects us in terms of mortgage rates and mortgages that we put in our portfolio. Typically we\u2019re putting $200 million to $250 million a month of jumbo mortgages within our portfolio and those are split, some fixed, some floating or some fixed, some aren\u2019t and the other place of the ten-year rate affects us is in the investment portfolio and as the rate drops that mortgage-backed securities we have in our investment portfolio tend to prepay a little bit faster and we reinvest that cash at slightly lower rates.","So with a dramatic drop in rates such as we\u2019ve seen, we would get probably a little bit more public awareness, a little bit more publicity and some of that will happen a little bit faster. The offset to that from a NIM and net interest income perspective of course is increased refis and increased fee income in the mortgage business that I\u2019m hope will act to completely offset the drop in net interest income from lower rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","John E. McDonald","Hi, good morning guys. I was wondering about just on the credit outlook Aleem, I think you said you kind of expect to maybe bounce around the charge-off level you are at now, is that maybe 30 basis points kind of in that ballpark, is that what you are thinking about?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think for full year 2014 John; we ended up around 34 basis points, 35 basis points.","John E. McDonald","Okay.","Aleem Gillani","And we\u2019re expecting a substantial move from that. Remember our through the cycle expectation for charge-offs is 40 to 70, obviously we\u2019re at a very strong point in the cycle. We\u2019ve been below the bottom end of our range and our current expectation is that we\u2019ll stay around that kind of a number in 2015.","John E. McDonald","Okay, and I think you said the same thing for the actual provision dollars as well?","Aleem Gillani","That\u2019s exactly right. As we look at it today, with what we know today we would expect provision in 2015 to be right around where it was at 2014 obviously that change is quarter-to-quarter, as we review our portfolio and economic conditions, but as we look at it today I\u2019d expect it to be right around the same kind of level.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terry McEvoy of Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Terry McEvoy","Hi, thanks good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Terry McEvoy","In the past you\u2019ve talked about a CRE heat map of the country could you just maybe discuss areas of strength in the fourth quarter in where you see the best growth opportunities in 2015?","Aleem Gillani","Sure. When we think about sort of CRE if I would think about the portfolio maybe almost in some kind of sequence office, multifamily, warehouse, industrial and retail probably in that order sort of as a global basis. Office for us primarily concentrated top markets and top spaces, so it\u2019s more about credit enhancement and positive part. And in large markets it has tended to perform well and be part of the growth.","On the multifamily side it\u2019s a little spottier and fairness I mean there is some markets that we do a lot of work with some markets where the absorption balance is just right. Globally it\u2019s still okay, but their pockets were, we\u2019ve gone from green to yellow in our map. And we are probably pulling back in a couple of places in multifamily.","Warehouse and industrial is sort of just of waiting, I mean I think that\u2019s coming back more slowly and we see selective pockets for us part of what\u2019s happening with the east coast ports opportunities, we are starting to see that kind of investments, so you see some of the challenges with the west coast ports, you see the investments that have been made on the east coast. So there has been a lot of development and discussion and dialogue and I think we\u2019re really well positioned long-term there. Retail is just - this would be a long time before it comes back, I mean I think that\u2019s in a slower place that\u2019s not where we have our primary emphasis.","Terry McEvoy","And then just as a follow-up, the increase in the provision within wholesale banking in the prepared remarks you talked about taking a look at the energy portfolio, could you just maybe expand specifically on what you did in terms of a stress testing and the analysis around the potential risk there that contributed to that small uptick.","William H. Rogers","Yes, Terry, we actually looked at our energy exposure from a bottoms up perspective, we\u2019ve been going through the names, obviously this started in about mid December or so as the market move started to steepen. We looked at our largest energy exposures, accessed each one from a bottoms up perspective that process is on going and we also looked at our overall exposure from a qualitative perspective and decided that while it didn\u2019t look like quantitatively we needed to make an adjustment, it would be prudent and appropriate for us to do so. So the increase in provision is in that context, we haven\u2019t seen any stress amongst any of our clients in that portfolio so far, it\u2019s still early, but we haven\u2019t seen any yet, but we\u2019re just trying to do the prudent thing and get ahead of what looks to be like a big move globally.","Aleem Gillani","Brad, we have time for one more question I believe.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew Burnell","Good morning gentlemen, just a couple of questions on mortgage. I noticed that production in the quarter was up about 20% year-over-year, I guess I\u2019m just curious if you could give us a little more color on your outlook for that business particularly in the wake of what have been some far more attractive mortgage rates throughout most of your footprint over the last few weeks and any guesses as to how long that may last?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, sequentially we\u2019re up about 4% from third and the fourth quarter was - refi was about 40% to 50%, so it really wasn\u2019t sort of the big refi part yet that\u2019s fairly consistent with where we were, so we had seen sort of some core parts of our business. Now that been said, applications are completely different, applications are 60%, 70% plus kind of refi, the first couple of weeks in January. Particularly last few days have actually been quite good and so we are seeing the potential there.","What I really like is where it\u2019s coming from, so as you know, we invested in our consumer direct business, so to think more online our core retail business. So it\u2019s coming from our markets, we\u2019re keeping our correspondent business sort of at about 50%, so where it was at the fourth quarter and so where it is now. So it\u2019s coming in our higher margin areas and we're able to balance that.","I want to be careful about over projecting, you can get excited about a couple of weeks and you can extrapolate numbers and get some big numbers as a result of that but I feel good about where its coming from, I feel good about how we're positioned to take advantage of it and the last few days have been very good, people have responded. As you would imagine the denominator let's say for total refinance is smaller, I mean just as you continue to go through a declining rate cycle that happens, but those that are eligible seem to be active.","William H. Rogers","Then Matt, I would add to that as you know we're a very good efficient and effective servicer and we\u2019ve been adding to our servicing portfolio over the course of the year, if you look at sort of end of 2013 to end of 2014, we\u2019ve added about $9 billion to our servicing portfolio and that\u2019s generating a nice increase in servicing income for us as we take advantage of our competitive advantage.","Aleem Gillani","And it is a good discussion too related to the efficiency ratio, so for example if this heats up a little more than we think. It could be slightly dilutive to our efficiency ratio and accretive to our earnings and we\u2019ll make that trade right now. So that\u2019s a good trade for us to make.","Matthew Burnell","Just staying on the theme of fee revenues, just curious as to your outlook in the first quarter and if you have visibility a little further than that that would be helpful for the capital markets business. That obviously was quite a good performer. This quarter has been pretty good in the second half of 2014. Just curious given all the vitality in the markets right now what your outlook might be for the first quarter or first half in investment banking capital markets?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, since you stretched it to the first half that will make it a little easier, because there is some volatility and certain markets are more active than others and clients are coming back and so reevaluating where they stand and what they want to do, but based on our pipeline they look great, our pipeline sort of continue that same momentum that we\u2019ve had in the past. I just think by quarter-by-quarter its going to look potentially a little bit different, but based upon the investments we\u2019ve made which I talked about earlier the pipeline the diversity of our mix and some parts that are actually starting small that have a much larger opportunity to growth, I don\u2019t have any reason to be anything less than optimistic. I think we're going to continue on the same phase, it\u2019s just going to be tricky quarter-by-quarter.","Ankur Vyas","Brad, this concludes our call.

You may begin.","Kris Dickson","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SunTrust's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us today.","In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

In our normal fashion, I'll begin today's call with some brief comments on our performance this quarter and then pass on to Aleem to provide details on the results. The high-level points are shown on Slide 3 of our presentation.","Core performance continued to steadily improve this quarter. Net income to common shareholders was $270 million, and earnings per share was $0.50, a $0.04 increase over last quarter and a $0.17 increase over last year.","On the revenue side, total revenue was up $28 million over last quarter, driven by higher noninterest income. Strong Mortgage revenue drove a $64 million or 7% sequential quarter increase in fee income, while our net interest income declined $36 million due to decrease in swap income.","Mortgage production volume remained high this quarter. To date this year, we've closed almost $16 billion in Mortgage loans, up over 50% from last year, which helped over 62,000 clients buy or refinance a home this year, including many through the HARP program.","Now moving to expenses. They were stable the last quarter and last year. Included in this quarter's expense was a $13 million noncash charge associated with redemption of a $1.2 billion of trust preferred securities. These were higher-cost fundings, and as such, we moved quickly to redeem them once the capital treatment of that occurred, allowing us to do so.","We've made significant progress in our efforts to reduce expenses through our PPG program. To date, we've generated annualized savings of $250 million, and we're now well within our sight of $300 million goal for the program.","Now at the risk of being redundant, I'll reiterate that we're committed to establishing a more efficiently-run organization. The PPG program was the catalyst, but was never intended to be the final goal for us. So what I'm saying here is that when PPG is done, our work is not. The ultimate objective is getting our efficiency ratio under 60%, and we have high intensity around both revenue and expense initiatives to help us achieve that goal.","Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Targeted loan growth, particularly in C&I, drove a $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and nearly a $10 billion increase over last year. At the same time, we've been actively managing down certain real estate-related loan balances.","Though average client deposits were stable to last quarter's record level, we continue to see the favorable mix shift this quarter. Average DDA balances were up 3% from the prior quarter and 23% from the prior year, while CD balances declined.","Credit quality also continued to improve across-the-board. Net charge-offs are 1.14% of average loans, down 17% from the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were down 7%, and early-stage delinquencies declined 7 basis points. Lastly, we generated additional positive capital growth with Tier 1 common ratio estimated at 9.4% at quarter end.","Now before I wrap up my comments and turn it over to Aleem, I'm going to take a minute to address our resubmitted capital plan under the 2012 CCAR process. As you're aware, we submitted our revised capital plan in mid-June. While the fed is in the process of reviewing our plan, I wanted to share with you in advance that we elected not to request any increase in the current level of the dividend or any other return of capital at this time. We made this decision in light of the fact that this submission only covered capital actions for the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013.","Additionally, we considered the close proximity of the resubmission to the 2013 CCAR process, which is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of this year, shortly after the time we expect to hear back on this plan. And we think this is the best course of action for the short term, but it's not indicative of our long-term plans to return capital prudently to shareholders.","As a reminder, in their review of our original plan submission, the fed did not object to the trust preferred redemptions, which, as I noted earlier, have been completed, or to maintaining the quarterly common stock dividend at $0.05 a share. The 2013 CCAR process will begin later this year, will provide us an opportunity to evaluate capital deployment alternatives for next year.","So overall, we made continued progress this quarter with momentum building in several key areas of our company. Of note was the solid noninterest income growth, mainly driven by strong Mortgage production, though with a pick up in several other fee categories as well. We also saw a continuation of a multi-quarter trend in increased performing loan balances, particularly in our C&I book. So looking ahead, challenges remain with the less-than-ideal operating environment, but I believe SunTrust is well-positioned to capitalize upon our opportunities.","And with that said, let me turn it over to Aleem.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. I'll begin my comments this morning on Slide 4. Bill had a lot of the highlights, so I'll be brief here and then we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides.","As Bill noted earlier, we're pleased to report higher earnings per share this quarter of $0.50, which is a $0.04 increase from the prior quarter and a $0.17 increase from last year. This sequential quarter income growth is attributable to higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision. Revenue grew $28 million, as higher noninterest income more than offset the swap-related decline in net interest income. Provision declined $17 million due to lower net charge-offs and continued improvements in other credit metrics.","Higher revenue and a lower loan loss provision also drove the growth from the second quarter of last year, where revenue increased by $48 million by a combination of higher net interest income and higher fee income, the latter of which was primarily mortgage-related. Improvements in credit quality were widespread, driving a $92 million decline in the provision, while noninterest expense was essentially unchanged.","Year-to-date EPS was $0.96. This is more than double the $0.41 reported during the first 6 months of last year. Revenue was higher, up 2% on a reported basis but by a more meaningful 5% net of the usual quarterly adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Other drivers were a lower loan loss provision and the redemption of the capital purchase program preferred shares.","Let's take a look at each of the major income statement categories, beginning with net interest income on Slide 5. On a sequential quarter basis, net interest income declined by $36 million or 3%, and the net interest margin fell by 10 basis points to 3.39%. Both of these declines were almost entirely due to the previously disclosed reduction in income for maturing commercial loan swaps. Excluding the impact of the swap, net interest income and margin were relatively stable as lower loan yields and a smaller securities portfolio were offset by the benefits of higher loan balances and an improved deposit mix.","Despite lower swap income, net interest income increased from the prior year by $20 million or 2%. Interest income declined by $49 million as lower asset yield outweighed the favorable impact of higher loan balances. However, this was more than offset by a $69 million decline in interest expense, driven by favorable liability trends, including strong DDA growth, a 17 basis point reduction in deposit rates paid and a 65 basis point decline in long-term debt costs.","I'll spend a few minutes discussing some of the major drivers of future net interest income and margin. First, on the asset side. With a slightly improving economy, we expect to see continued loan growth, which would be additive to net interest income. Although as you're well aware, most going-on rates are lower than the portfolio's current yield. Our securities balances declined somewhat this quarter, as we didn't see many attractive alternatives in light of the continued decline in yields. But we'll continue to monitor the market, and we'll pick our spots to reinvest. Commercial loan swap income is expected to stay relatively stable through the next year at its current level of about $120 million per quarter, assuming no major changes to LIBOR.","Turning to the liability side. During the third quarter, we'll begin to benefit from last week's redemption of $1.2 billion in higher-cost trust-preferred securities, which had a weighted average cost of about 7%. Deposit pricing opportunities are obviously becoming limited at this point, given their low absolute rates, but this is something that we do continue to evaluate and manage carefully. We'll also benefit from higher-cost CDs maturing and rolling into lower rate products.","So all told, there are headwinds and tailwinds. As we look specifically to the third quarter, we expect those headwinds and tailwinds to largely offset one another, such that the net interest margin is relatively stable.","Look at noninterest income on Slide 6. Second quarter noninterest income was $940 million, a sequential quarter increase of $64 million on a reported basis or $39 million net of the adjustment items we detail in the appendix. Mortgage production income was strong this quarter, as origination volumes and gains on sale remained high.","During the quarter, we closed over $8.2 billion of loans, which was up 8%. Purchase volume was $3 billion, an increase of over $1 billion. Refinance volume declined modestly, but remained healthy at $5.2 billion. Mortgage production income was $103 million this quarter or $258 million exclusive of the mortgage repurchase provision. Sequential quarter growth and the reported figure was $40 million, $20 million of which was attributable to a lower repurchase provision and $18 million due to a gain in conjunction with the sale of a portfolio containing government-guaranteed mortgages. And I'll discuss both of those in more detail on subsequent slides.","In addition to the increase in mortgage production, we saw growth in numerous other consumer and commercial fee categories. As a couple of examples, loan commitment fees, recorded in the other charges and fees line item, were strong, and card fees grew due to increased client usage. Relative to the prior year, noninterest income was up $28 million on a reported basis and $59 million or 7% on an adjusted basis.","The largest driver of the adjusted fee growth was a $99 million increase in mortgage production, with core mortgage production income up $164 million, partially offset by a $65 million increase in the repurchase provision. Trading income was also a driver of the year-over-year growth due to improved market conditions. On the flip side, card fees declined due to the implementation of caps on debit interchange income. We also saw a decline in investment banking income on lower syndicated finance volume.","Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Mortgage repurchase demands, shown in the top-left box, were $489 million this quarter. That's an increase of about $40 million from last quarter, but within our range of expectations and well below the elevated levels we saw in the fourth quarter of last year.","Demands continue to be concentrated in the 2006 to 2008 vintages, which have accounted for roughly 90% of all demand activity over the past several years, as well as this quarter. While demand levels may remain elevated in the coming quarters, consistent with what we've expressed for several quarters now, the underlying trends in demands and full file requests continue to suggest to us that the agencies are making progress in working through these higher-loss content vintages. For example, full file request volume has moderated somewhat and continue to transition toward loans that are delinquent but not yet in foreclosure.","Pending population, shown in the top-right portion of this slide, increased to $652 million, up roughly $90 million from the prior quarter. This was the result of the increase in new demands, as well as a slower rate of demand resolution. We're taking a deliberate approach to the demand review process, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate, yet cure or moderate losses wherever possible.","Mortgage repurchase reserve, shown at the bottom left of the page, increased to $434 million, up $51 million from the first quarter. The increase relates primarily to the higher level of the pending population. Said differently, the reserve increase is in part due to the higher level of demands and, in part, to a reduction in charge-offs, which is merely a function of loss recognition timing.","Similar to prior quarters, some summary statistics of our sold mortgages are displayed at the bottom right of this page, and we've also provided some additional detail on the 2006 to 2008 vintages in the appendix.","Overall, I'd note that our expectations around mortgage repurchases remain generally unchanged from what we've shared with you in recent quarters. We foresee demand volume remaining high and variable in the coming quarters. However, if recent patterns and full file requests continue as anticipated, we expect to see a reduced income statement impact towards the end of this year.","Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Expenses were essentially stable compared to both the prior quarter and prior year. On a sequential quarter basis, employee compensation and benefits declined by $35 million due to the seasonal reduction in benefits. This decline was offset by growth in a handful of other categories. Bill mentioned earlier the $13 million noncash charge that we incurred related to the redemption of trust preferred securities.","Additionally, operating losses increased $9 million due to specific mortgage-related losses and legal accruals. FDIC premiums increased $8 million. This line item was a bit lower than normal in the first quarter, and the Q2 level is expected to be a more normal run rate. In credit-related expenses, which we detailed for you, as usual, in the appendix, increased by $7 million.","I will point out that this quarter, we refined our methodology for recognizing tax payments on delinquent loans, which resulted in an approximate $10 million increase in credit and collection expenses. As a result of this change, we should not experience the seasonal fourth quarter spike in this line item that we've seen in prior years.","Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $11 million, driven by lower FDIC premiums, credit-related expenses and marketing costs. These declines were partially offset by a modest increase in compensation and higher outside processing costs.","Before we turn to the balance sheet starting on Slide 9, I'll summarize this quarter's income statement by noting that we drove continued improvement in our core earnings this quarter. Obviously, our low -- our absolute level of profitability is still well below our profit-generation capability. But overall, we were pleased to note continued progression toward a more normalized level of earnings.","Average performing loans increased again this quarter, up sequentially by a little over $1 billion or about 1%. Growth was driven by commercial loans, specifically C&I, which was up $1.3 billion.","Within our Wholesale businesses, growth continued to be concentrated in larger corporate clients and to be well diversified. Specific industry verticals within our Corporate Investment Bank that drove the bulk of this quarter's growth were healthcare, diversified, financial services and media.","We also booked some modest growth in our Diversified Commercial Banking business, driven by auto dealers and not-for-profit clients. While we saw a continued runoff of legacy assets in our commercial real estate book, the pace of decline moderated again this quarter.","The residential portfolio was relatively stable this quarter. Within it, we grew non-guaranteed loans by about $700 million, driven by high FICO jumbo loans. The guaranteed portfolio was down approximately $600 million, largely due to the sale of $0.5 billion in loans this quarter.","Relative to the prior year, performing loans grew almost $10 billion or 9%, with the growth coming entirely from our targeted categories, namely C&I, guaranteed mortgages and consumer loans. C&I led the way, up $5.6 billion or 12%, driven by large corporate and middle market borrowers. Consumer loans increased almost $4 billion or 24%, with growth across all loan categories, most notably student loans.","And government-guaranteed mortgages were up $1.5 billion or about 33%. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in certain portfolios, including CRE, construction and home equity, which were managed down by a combined $2.3 billion.","The continued impact of this derisking is evident on Slide 10. Portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by $14 billion or 60% over the past few years, and they were down by another $400 million this quarter.","Higher-risk balances were managed down by over $2 billion or 18% from the prior year, with the decline split relatively evenly between the 3 major categories. This can be seen at the bottom of the page. The overall decline and the higher risk balances over the past few years has essentially been offset by increases in government-guaranteed loans. This combination has helped to significantly improve the risk profile of the company in a relatively short period of time.","Additionally, the increases in government-guaranteed balances also served as a bridge to a time of organic loan growth. Recent quarters' higher-risk loan balances have declined at a slower pace in light of the smaller size of this portfolio and its improving risk characteristics.","Additionally, we've seen a pickup in organic loan demand. As such, and as part of our continued active management of the balance sheet, we elected to sell about $0.5 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, and this resulted in an $18 million gain.","Let's turn to Slide 11 for a review of credit trends. Credit quality continued to trend favorably this quarter, with meaningful declines in delinquencies, nonperforming assets, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs. Early-stage delinquencies, excluding government-guaranteed loans, were down by 8 basis points from the prior quarter, driven by residential loans. Non-guaranteed mortgage delinquency rates declined by 23 basis points, and home equity improved by 11 basis points.","Nonperforming loans declined sequentially by almost $200 million or 7%. Improvements were evident across the portfolio, most notably in commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction. Nonperforming assets declined by over $300 million or 11%, driven by the decline in nonperforming loans, as well as reductions in other real estate owned and the completion of the sale of the nonperforming mortgage loans that we commenced last quarter. Year-over-year, nonperforming loans were down $1.2 billion or more than 30%. All loan categories showed improvement, with the highest declines coming from commercial construction, CRE and C&I.","Net charge-offs declined by $72 million or 17% sequentially, and the net charge-off ratio fell by 24 basis points to 1.14%. Non-guaranteed mortgages, home equity and commercial real estate were the biggest drivers of the improvement. Relative to the prior year, net charge-offs were lower by $155 million, or about 30%, with meaningful improvements seen across most of the portfolios.","The allowance for loan and lease losses was $2.3 billion at quarter end or 1.86% of loans. In light of the continued favorable trends in credit quality, the allowance declined this quarter, albeit at a more modest pace than recent quarters. Excluding government-guaranteed loans from the denominator of the allowance calculation, the ratio stood at 2.07%.","Overall, we were pleased with our trends in credit metrics, and the improvements exceeded our expectations, particularly in net charge-offs. As we look forward, a recovering economy should continue to support our positive asset quality trends with improvements primarily driven by the residential portfolio, as most of the commercial and consumer portfolios are currently nearing more normal credit metric levels. Looking specifically at the third quarter, we currently expect to see additional declines in nonperforming loans and relatively stable net charge-offs.","Let's take a look at deposit performance. Average deposit balances were stable with their record first quarter level of approximately $126 billion. A favorable shift in deposit mix continued as DDA and savings increased while higher-cost time deposits declined. Compared to last year, client deposits were up $4 billion or 3%. Lower-cost deposits drove the increase, with DDA up almost $7 billion or 23%. Conversely, time deposits were down almost $3 billion or 14%. This favorable mix shift has contributed to our year-over-year net interest income growth.","Slide 13 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common increased for the eighth consecutive quarter, up sequentially by approximately $300 million, primarily from increased retained earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.4%, up another 7 basis points from last quarter's 9.33%.","While not shown on this slide, I'll mention the capital impact of our decision to call the $1.2 billion of higher-cost trust-preferred securities. The redemption of these securities resulted in a reduction of our Basel I Tier 1 ratio of about 90 basis points, and that impact is already reflected in our second quarter capital ratio estimates. As you're aware, this will not impact our fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 ratio as trust preferreds are not Tier 1 qualifying instruments.","As it relates to our recent Basel III notice of proposed rulemaking, we continue to evaluate the potential impact to our capital ratios. Under this proposal, we expect to see some increase in risk-weighted assets and a corresponding decrease in capital ratios, primarily due to the ranges of risk weightings for residential mortgages and home equity. If implemented, as stated in the recent NPR, our resulting capital ratios should still comfortably exceed all proposed regulatory requirements.","Bottom part of this slide shows our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share. Both were up this quarter due to increases in retained earnings and other comprehensive income. Tangible common equity ratio increased by 17 basis points to 8.15%, while our tangible book value per share climbed about 2% to end the quarter just above $26.","Let's turn to Slide 14 for a discussion of our Playbook for Profitable Growth expense program. As you can see, we made continued progress against the $300 million expense savings goal for the PPG program. To date, we've reached $250 million in annualized savings.","As you know, this program is comprised of numerous expense savings initiatives broken into 3 main buckets: strategic supply management, Consumer Bank efficiencies and operations and support staff. This quarter, we garnered savings in each of these categories. And on the slide, you can see the activities that were the primary drivers of the savings.","In our strategic supply management initiatives, we achieved additional savings through further contract renegotiations. Additionally, we have successfully managed down our own spending on items we consider discretionary, items such as travel, temp labor, print and wireless service. Our teammates are finding ways everyday to cut out expenses for things that once seemed like a necessity. There's a high level of commitment here throughout the company, and this is something every teammate can do to improve efficiency and meet our goals.","In the Consumer Bank efficiencies category, we've achieved savings primarily due to 2 key initiatives. First, we revamped our branch staffing model to better align market needs with staff, from both a capabilities and a volume perspective. We're achieving greater efficiencies by differentiating staffing by client segment served and market opportunity. Furthermore, we've changed our incentive compensation structure for certain types of positions, and this is now yielding real dollar savings.","Several initiatives have driven our operations and support staff savings, though the chief component of our savings this quarter came from tighter spans and layers with further reductions in FTEs. We also made additional progress in our efforts to leverage digital technology, making significant reductions in the number of paper statements that we now process.","Though we are rapidly approaching our goal of $300 million in savings, as Bill mentioned earlier, this, by no means, should imply that we are done with our work here. PPG was the beginning of a process of transformation of SunTrust. We will continue to leverage the strong momentum we have generated to drive toward our ultimate goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio upon the abatement of elevated credit and mortgage-related expenses. PPG program is only the start of our efficiency improvement efforts.","That wraps up my comments for today. So I'll call -- I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And before we move into Q&A, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight some of the progress we've been making in our lines of business. These results punctuate the core momentum we're building.","I'll start by noting that the efficiency ratio is down at each of the lines of business relative to last quarter and last year. Of course, their absolute levels are too high, but each business has specific plans that aimed at driving continued improvements.","In our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth line of business, we generated solid DDA growth of 11%, and loan production volume was up a healthy 19% during the first half of the year. From a revenue perspective -- I mean, regulatory headwinds continued to challenge noninterest income in this business. However, you'll notice that expenses were down 7% from the second quarter of last year, due in large part to reductions in staffing driven by our PPG initiatives, which Aleem highlighted.","Another encouraging statistic is that client loyalty continued to increase in our retail business this quarter, solidifying our position as an industry-leading bank and our footprint for this metric. Also of note here is our credit card business. Our relaunch of this business is in its early stages, but it's going well thus far, with new account sales more than 4x the levels generated in the second quarter of last year.","We've been delivering strong results in our Wholesale business. Year-to-date net income was nearly double what it was a year ago. We saw a record net income and revenue in Corporate, Investment Banking, and it generated the lion's share of the 8% Wholesale loan growth over last year. DDA balances were up over 20%, driven by our Diversified Commercial Banking business.","We're also beginning to generate some core commercial real estate growth. Like credit card, we're in the early stages here, but we're pleased with our progress and believe commercial real estate loan balances are nearing an inflection point where we'll start to see some growth in this portfolio in coming quarters.","We're also seeing improving trends in our Mortgage line of business. Year-to-date, Mortgage production volume was up $5.5 billion or over 50%, and core Mortgage production income was $320 million higher. The overall profitability of our Mortgage business continues to be negatively impacted by legacy issues and still operating a net loss position this quarter, but the trends are improving. Given the current rate environment and some overall improvements in the housing market, coupled with the HARP pipeline, we expect to have near-term Mortgage production revenue to remain strong.","So overall, line of business performance is trending positively, and we're seeing the results more clearly in the company's financial metrics. Our SunTrust team is working hard in delivering better results, and I'd be remiss in not recognizing them and thanking them for their collective effort.","So with that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you.","Kris Dickson","Candy, we're ready to start the Q&A. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from John Pancari, Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us some more color around your decision to not request deployment as part of the CCAR resubmission? I mean, was it influenced by the Basel III NPR? I know you didn't give us the basis point impact, but that would be helpful as well on Tier 1 common.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. John, it's Bill. I'll take the first crack at that. First of all, it was not influenced by the -- by Basel III. I think sort of in its simplest form, I mean, the resubmission gave us 2 more quarters of better performance. Waiting until 2013 gives us 4 quarters of continued performance, and you've seen we're on the steady trend. That might ought to give some indication of our confidence. So it was more just continuing to wait for the company's performance to improve, both on the income side and the credit metric side, not actually more complicated than that.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So do you have what the basis point impact from the Basel III NPR changes...?","William Henry Rogers","I'll let Aleem take a swing at that.","Aleem Gillani","John, let me take a crack at that. First of all, I think we -- I've got to say, we were pleased to see the NPR. Having that out I think is going to provide more clarity to the industry as to what the capital -- expected capital ratios are going to look like going forward. Having said that, parts of the NPR, I think, came as a little bit of a surprise. On the numerator side, it came out pretty well, as much as the industry expected. But on the denominator side, some of the changes to RWA, for example, were not expected and aren't, actually, part of the Basel proposal. These are U.S. regulatory proposals. We are, along with the rest of the industry, responding to that proposal now, and I think the industry has a deadline of sometime in September to respond back to that. At that point, the regulators will take a look at all of the response letters and come out with final rules at some point, probably next year. As we try to estimate what we might look like under this proposal, I think you've seen a lot of banks over the last few days estimate that their final numbers are in -- are going to be in that 8% range, using these proposals on our current portfolios and prior to any management mitigation. And I think it'd be fair, as you look at our portfolio, to say we'll come in around that same kind of level as most other banks are estimating.","Operator","Next question is from Josh Levin, Citigroup.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So given how challenging the rate environment is for all the banks, one of your peers yesterday said it was going to close up to 5% of its branches. As you think about the environment, rates and regulatory costs and how you want to drive costs down, are you considering branch closings or some kind of infrastructure reduction in order to save costs?","William Henry Rogers","I think I'd put it more in the category of just general efficiencies. And particularly in the Consumer Banking area, I mean, if you look at what we've done, expenses being down 7% there, that's a combination of just being efficient. Clearly, transaction volume in branches are down. I mean, nobody is sort of missing that. I'm a believer in that -- that branch is a sales center, as much as it is a service center. So physically having people there on the sales side is a benefit. Whether we close a few branches or open a few branches, I mean, we'll sort of be netting around that number. We'll look at that as a consideration long term. But the real efficiency just is in what we do within the branches, and you're already starting to see that from us. I mean, I think we're sort of ahead of the game on that front.","Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Some of your peers have suggested that over the last few weeks, given the macro uncertainty, customers are becoming a bit more reticent about investing in their businesses. Are you hearing that or sensing that from your customers when you're out in the field?","William Henry Rogers","It's sort of a tale of 2 cities. I mean, you see what's going on with our loan growth, particularly on the upper-end side. Our pipelines on the commercial side are actually quite strong and ahead of where they were significantly this time last year. But if you're out there, and I'm out there a lot, and you talk to primarily sort of on the small business side, yes, I think there's a lot of uncertainty in the -- all the things that would cause that uncertainty, from fiscal cliff to tax to healthcare to all the things that they're concerned about, and you see it in the cash build-up. But having despite all that, we're still seeing some good loan growth.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Mutascio, Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher M. Mutascio - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Aleem, if you can walk me through something, I would appreciate it. On Slide 14, you talked about the cost saves that you've realized, about $250 million of the $300 million that you've planned for. But then I go to Slide 26 in the presentation and look at your own adjusted core noninterest expense, and on a year-over-year basis, you're only down $10 million. So I would've expected that quarterly number to be down more like $60 million or 1\/4 of the $250 million of savings that you've gotten already. So I guess my question is, where are the cost saves coming?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, Chris, let me help you a little bit with that. There have been cost saves pretty well across-the-board. There've been cost saves, for example, in compensation. There've been cost saves in areas -- discretionary expenses. And as you go down our income statement, those cost saves have showed up pretty well all the way down the line, however, some of those have been offset by cost increases in some other areas. For example, our -- we've got some consulting costs for now that have come in as a result of the mortgage foreclosure review that were not originally anticipated. So you'll see some of those in there. And you'll see some compensation increases as a result of increased revenue. And so just as a result of revenue-related compensation increases, we've got some increases there. And so that's why, overall, you see a netting, but that netting is -- I would consider that to be a really good trade, in that we're paying people commissions on revenue they're generating, while at the same time, we're reducing core costs.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. I mean, if you put some -- this is Bill. If you put some numbers around that, just think of the 2 businesses that are most highly correlated to compensation, in Mortgage and CIB, and over a year-over-year comparison, they're up about $350 million in revenue and about $50 million in comp. Well, I think that's a pretty good trade-off. Similarly, our core revenue is up about 5%, and core expenses are up about 1.5%. So that -- those are driving us towards that lower efficiency ratio. Do we want it to be faster? Are we still frustrated by our level of expenses? Absolutely. It won't be an excuse-making category. But some of these trade-offs, as it relates to revenue and comp, I think, are worth making.","Operator","And next question is from Jefferson Harralson, KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to possibly discuss this 60% efficiency ratio goal and what needs to happen to get there. So you assume the rest of PPG assume all of credit and collections. Do you need some -- or some percentage of credit and collections and credit-related expenses? And do you need to have a better margin or a better operating environment or higher rates to get all the way to the 60s?","William Henry Rogers","Jefferson, this is Bill. Let me take it really high level, and then we can just let it go down any tributary you want to go down it. And this is the way that I like to think about it, just because it sort of makes it easy and it doesn't make it sort of dependent upon a bunch of exogenous factors. If you normalize a number of facts -- so let's assume sort of a flat revenue environment. Let's assume we actually don't get another penny's worth of revenue. If you normalize for a net charge-off\/provision at some basis, so normalize it wherever you want to, but call it 50 to 70 basis points, which is clearly higher than we've trended in the past. If you normalize for FIN 45, mortgage repurchase and just put some number in there, pick a number, but it's -- it would be appreciably smaller than where it is today. Then you normalize for the credit-related expenses, so there, they've run about $800 million, sort of annualized a little higher, now they're running closer to $700 million annualized, and we're starting to see that benefit. It used to be about $200 million. I don't think we'll get to there. So pick a number, just cut it in half as a thought process and then put $300 million in PPG on top of that and you get to, at that point, essentially a 60% efficiency ratio and a 1% plus ROA. So at a really high level, I mean, that sort of what gives us confidence. Now it won't work out that way exactly, and there'll be puts and takes. And the timing will be different, and one quarter will be up, one quarter will be down. But if you think about that in sort of a goal, that's it. Now to the point of PPG, if some of those things don't materialize, if the credit expenses don't come down like that or if the charge-offs don't normalize the way I've described or, in fact, if revenue is down for some reason unforeseen, then the number on the savings will be higher. I mean, that's how I like to think about it, just sort of about a really, really high level. Does that make sense?","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It does. It does.","Operator","And next question is from Paul Miller, FDR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On Slide 7 of the mortgage repurchase trends, you -- I love this detail, by the way, guys, best detail out there. There was a particular company yesterday at one of your competitors that said that they felt that repurchase claims would increase by the end of the year from discussions with the GSEs, that they were going to get requests from every loan that has defaulted that they sold to them over the '05-'09 time period. I know you took a big charge-back in the fourth quarter. Was that due to that same type of discussions? Are you getting all your files requested from the GSEs? I'm just wondering, a lot of guys are guiding us to higher numbers towards end of the year, and you're guiding to lower. So have you already been through that process with the GSEs?","Aleem Gillani","I'm not sure where others are in their progress with the GSEs. But we feel like last year was our peak, and probably the fourth quarter of last year was our peak, in terms of total demand and provisions. As we look to the next several quarters, the trends that we're seeing are, for example, changes in full file requests and the nature of the full file requests, which we're seeing now. And as you know, those are a precursor to where future demands are moving more toward loans that are earlier stage in delinquency and not in foreclosure. And given that -- given those trends, it looks to us like demands will decline over time. Now there's always going to be some volatility. You never know one quarter to another. But directionally, it does look like, that given where we're seeing in full file requests, demands will actually decline.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So you've been getting full file requests since last year?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. We've been getting full file requests all the way through.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All the way through?","Aleem Gillani","The nature of those full file requests, as they move away from foreclosed loans and toward delinquent loans, is a key indicator for what we're expecting to see in future demands. We -- I think we're improving our dialogue with the agencies all the time. And as we continue to improve communication and dialogue and continue to gain confidence in what we expect to see, we're starting to feel a little bit better about these numbers.","Operator","And next question is from Matt O'Connor, Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sure you've seen some other banks try to take an upfront hit to reserve for the mortgage repurchase cost. And I guess I'm just wondering, one, do you just not have enough information to do this, or do you not really believe in kind of kitchen sinking the quarter? Or how should we think about it? Because you've seen others think that it's estimated, well, what the lifetime losses would be at this point.","William Henry Rogers","You've just made our CFO perspire a little bit.","Aleem Gillani","Matt, I think, yes, you've seen a couple of banks that have provided a lifetime loss, but most haven't. Most banks, including us, have got a reserve that -- which reflects losses that are both probable and estimable. And that line around probable and estimable losses in the reserve, as the industry learns more from the GSEs, probably converges with the line of an estimated lifetime loss. And you might have had a couple of banks this quarter that feel confident enough in their communication and what they're seeing, and there've actually seen those 2 lines cross. I think for the whole industry that's not the case yet. But probably over time, as more and more communication improves with the GSEs, yes, you will see those lines continue to converge and then cross.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And I know it's difficult to know sitting here right now, but would you hope that by the end of the year to have enough visibility that you could put this issue behind you as we think about 2013 and beyond? Or is your best guess that, that won't happen?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I'm not sure exactly when it will happen. But, Matt, if your question is, do I hope it will happen? Yes, I hope it will. But I don't know that I can say with complete confidence it will be by the end of this year. Obviously, the sooner, the better.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And your comments about the actual cost itself coming down kind of towards the end of year, by the end of the year, I guess that would imply costs in 3Q similar to 2Q, and then hopefully down the fourth quarter?","Aleem Gillani","I don't know that I can give you an exact quarter. But I will say, yes, by the end of this year, they will be down.","Operator","Next question is from Ed Najarian, ISI Group.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess my question, my first question is a follow-up on Chris's question about operating costs. When I sort of look at your year-over-year op costs and then I normalize for the TruPS redemption cost this quarter, but then I get about $21 million of lower FDIC-related costs on a year-over-year basis this quarter versus last quarter. And then again, I try to factor in the $250 million of PPG savings. It looks like your internal expense growth rate is running about 5% to 6% annually. Probably that's a little bit higher than what you would call sort of a normalized growth rate x the PPG savings because of the revenue you talked about and because of the strong mortgage quarter, but can you give us a sense of what you think that sort of normal internal growth rate is x expense savings going forward? Would it be 3%, 4%, 5%? How should we think about that?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think the 5% number that you referenced is generally about right. However, remember, that includes the effect of the increased revenue growth also. So looking just at the expense line alone, without looking at the revenue growth and the effect -- the positive effect that's had on the bottom line, might be a little bit one-sided. In terms of what we expect to see as a normalized expense growth number going forward, what we're shooting for is low single digits. And so certainly lower than 5% is what we would expect our core expense growth to be on a normalized basis.","Edward R. Najarian - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up. When I'm looking at the average balance sheet and I'm looking at your funding costs, specifically sort of aggregated interest-bearing funding costs, in the first quarter, they were 77 basis points. They fell 1 basis point to 76 basis points this quarter, so pretty flat. Now I recognize that you're going to get some benefit from redeeming the TruPS in the third quarter. But other than that TruPS redemption benefit, do you feel like you're starting to run out of room to further drop your funding costs? That's what it would look like just on a -- sort of a one-quarter look basis. Or do you still feel like there are some areas, again, excluding that TruPS benefit, to continue to drive down funding costs?","Aleem Gillani","And I'm glad you referenced this was only a one-quarter look. And you're right. We only dropped 1 basis point this quarter, but I don't think that's actually the start of the flattening trend. Now having said that, deposit rates are at absolute low levels. So it's hard for us, or anybody, to grind them down by double digits from here. But we do believe we still have some runway to drop deposit costs further from here, and you may see some of that this quarter. One of the levers we have is maturing CDs. We've got several billion dollars of -- $4 billion of CDs that are going to be maturing between now and the end of the year, and they have the weighted average cost of north of 1%. So you would expect to see those renew at much lower yields between now and the end of the year, and that'll drop our deposit costs, I think, much more than the 1 basis point you saw in Q2.","Operator","Next question is from Gerard Cassidy, RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","The question I have is, when you look at your slide, I think it's 25 or so, where you have the detail on the put-back numbers by vintages. The question is the ever 120 days past due that you list there, $21.5 billion, are those outstanding, so we could take it relative to the number you have up above the outstanding UPB at $31.7 billion? Or is that $21.5 billion really reflective of the $120 billion, which is the total sold number?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, that's reflective of the $120 billion.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So the $21.5 billion includes loans that have been paid off, then?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, that's part of the $120 billion that was totally sold.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Do you know how much of the $21.5 billion is in the outstanding UPB bucket?","William Henry Rogers","I don't right now. But if you try giving Kris a call later, he may be able to help you.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then second, on the cost savings program that you guys announced. One of your competitors yesterday, KeyCorp, announced a cost-savings program, which is a second one for them. They had one in place that ended at the end of 2011. What kind of environment would you have to see where you would announce another similar type of program as the one that's in place now?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, I think, sort of, this goes back to my earlier comments. This isn't so much about a program as it is about a culture and it is about driving to a goal. So I'll continue to talk about what we're doing to drive to a 60% efficiency ratio, and in fairness, I'll probably talk less about programs. As I mentioned in my comments, the program was really the catalyst. I mean, that was to sort of set the initial bar, the starting gun to turn things around. So for us, it's really driving towards that efficiency ratio. I mean, every unit in our company has an efficiency ratio target. They know what they're driving towards. There are lots of corporate initiatives underway that help them get there. But there are lots of just good individual smart thinking and smart management, and it's going to be more of that than the announcement of another program.","Operator","Our final question comes from Terry McEvoy, Oppenheimer.","Terence J. McEvoy - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll move away from expenses. Bill, in the Atlanta Journal last weekend, you said SunTrust is Goldilocks today, or just the right size. I guess my question is, are there certain markets where you need to have a greater presence to get to that Goldilocks position? And in light of the cost-cutting efforts, does it make sense to exit certain markets versus building a scale in investing?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, thanks for reminding me of that reference. My point was right. I might have used a different reference. In -- we've been very careful and planful of having scale and relevance, and I think relevance is the most important comment in all of our markets. There isn't a particular market today that I would say we're not relevant in, that we're looking to have an exit in. Everywhere where we are, we've got an opportunity, and we're big enough, either with branches or commercial lenders or CIB or mortgage or some combination of the businesses that we're engaged in, in a market to be relevant. Now that being said, are we constantly looking at everything and looking at efficiencies, and do we have an opportunity intra-market with leveraging our in stores and traditional branches and loan production ops and all that? Sure, we'll always be looking at that. But the great part about our franchise is the fact that we're in great markets, and we're relevant in those markets. So as a general thesis, no.","Okay, great. Well, maybe just a quick comment before we wrap up the call, and thank you.","And though we cannot -- we can't change the operating environment or the pace at which the full recovery happens, but there is plenty that we can do and that we have been doing and will continue to do here at SunTrust. We're building a more effective and efficient company. We're improving our talent base. We're ensuring that our teammates have the tools and training they need to uncover and meet more client needs and deliver the revenue results that we expect. A simple way of putting it is we're building more intensity around everything we do in virtually every corner of our organization.","So with that being said, again, thank you for joining us today, and please reach out to Investor Relations and Kris with any additional questions that you may have.","Kris Dickson","Thank you, everybody.

I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn over to Aleem for additional details, including our results at the business segment level. I will conclude with the review of our performance in 2015 as a whole in addition to providing some forward-looking perspectives.","We delivered solid results this quarter, which is a direct result of the focus we have maintained on executing our primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing capital return to shareholders.","For the fourth quarter, we reported $0.91 of earnings per share, which included $0.03 of discrete tax benefits. When adjusting for non-core items, earnings per share were stable compared with the prior quarter and prior year. Continued improvement in net interest income this quarter was offset by a decline in non-interest income as a result of challenging market conditions in addition to normal quarterly variability. Capital markets related income was in line with the prior quarter as the slowdown in fixed income markets was offset by higher equity origination fees and trading income, the latter, which was a result of increased client-driven interest rate hedging activities.","Overall, we are successfully deepening client relationships within our wholesale banking platform and benefiting from our diverse business mix and breadth of capabilities. We achieved our goal of attaining the sub 63% efficiency ratio and ended the year with an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 62.7%, 24 basis points better than 2014.","Looking ahead, we remain focused on achieving our long-term goal of the being sub-60% and we will continue to diligently manage expenses while also investing in strategic revenue-generating initiatives throughout the company. We continue to see the benefits of our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts, which drove a 4 basis point improvement in our net interest margin and a $34 million increase in net interest income. This is further realization of a positive shift in our overall earning asset and funding mix.","Average loans were up 2% compared to the third quarter driven by growth across most sectors, including commercial, consumer direct and residential mortgage. While loan growth will ebb and flow quarter-to-quarter, we remain confident in our ability to generate growth in segments where returns are appropriate and we can have deeper relationships. However, we closely manage areas that don\u2019t meet those thresholds. Average deposits were also up 2%, which is further evidence of the success we are having in deepening client relationships across the company. Growing deposits remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability, the latter of which is evidenced by the 35% reduction in long-term debt over the past year.","Overall asset quality remains favorable. However, we did see an increase in non-performing loans as a result of deterioration in our energy-related exposure, which Aleem will provide details on later. Provision expense was less impacted as we have been building reserves in the previous quarters. The net charge-off ratio was 24 basis points, a strong result, but likely unsustainable long-term. Lastly, our capital position continues to be strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis.","So, with that as a brief overview, I will turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details on the quarter\u2019s performance.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before I jump into the details, I would like to call your attention to a new table we are presenting on Slide 4, which highlights key metrics over the past five quarters and will help you analyze our financial performance in an efficient manner. As it is year end, we have added this slide to the main presentation and going forward, you will find this in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 5, you can see the net interest margin improved by 4 basis points driven by higher security deals as a result of slower prepayment speeds, further low cost deposit growth and lower long-term debt as we received a full quarter benefit of the $1.7 billion debt reduction in the third quarter. Net interest income increased $34 million sequentially driven by solid 2% loan and deposit growth and the 4 basis point improvement in NIM. As a result of our activity balance sheet management efforts, overall net interest income has been grinding higher since the first quarter, which we had anticipated would be the trough. For the full year, net interest income declined at 2% entirely due to a decline in commercial loan swap income as a result of lower fixed rates. In 2016, commercial loan swap income will decline modestly relative to 2015 largely due to an anticipated increase in LIBOR, which would be more than offset by higher net interest income from the core asset sensitivity of the balance sheet.","Looking ahead, we expect first quarter net interest margin to improve further 3 to 5 basis points relative to the fourth quarter. From there, NIM will likely be relatively stable for the remainder of 2016 assuming we only get one additional increase in the federal funds rate. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the current low interest rate environment while also ensuring our balance sheet is structured to benefit from potential increases in short-term rates.","Moving on to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income declined $32 million sequentially primarily driven by asset disposition gains in the third quarter and lower wealth management-related revenue in the fourth quarter partially offset by an increase in mortgage related income. Wealth management-related revenue declined $13 million sequentially partially due to seasonal trust fees typically earned in the third quarter, but also due to market conditions, which reduced assets under management and client activity. Investment banking income declined $11 million as fixed income originations were negatively impacted by challenging market conditions. Equity originations and M&A however remained relatively strong, which is a reflection of the strategic capabilities that we have expanded over the past few years.","Trading income increased $11 million driven by higher derivative marketing revenue as commercial clients increased their utilization of interest rate swaps to hedge potential changes in rates. Mortgage servicing income improved by $16 million due to higher servicing fees, some of which is seasonal, lower decay expense and better hedge performance. Mortgage production income declined $5 million as lower production was generally offset by improved channel mix.","Service charges on deposits continue to steadily decline, a reflection of the increased transparency and technology we are providing our clients so they can manage their accounts more effectively. This decline will continue in 2016, in part driven by enhancements to our posting order process which once fully implemented will help our clients save more money and reduce our service charges by approximately $10 million per quarter. This transition will occur in the second half of 2016. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year non-interest income was down 4% driven by declines across most categories, largely due to the challenging market conditions experienced in the second half of 2015.","Moving on to expenses on Slide 7, adjusted non-interest expense increased $35 million sequentially, almost entirely due to $32 million of discrete recoveries recognized in the previous quarter related to the successful resolution of previous mortgage matters. Outside processing and software costs were up $22 million due to higher utilization of certain third party services in addition to normal quarterly variability. Amortization expense increased by $8 million similar to last year\u2019s increase as we invested additional capital in low income communities which was generally offset by a correspondingly lower provision for income taxes. Offsetting these increases was a $35 million decline in personnel costs driven primarily by lower accruals on certain incentive and medical costs as we calibrated expenses to actual performance. While quarterly incentive and benefits costs can be variable, for the full year incentive compensation increased due to improved business performance in 2015 which is consistent with our pay for performance philosophy. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year adjusted non-interest expense increased 2% driven by a combination of higher personnel expense and outside processing and software costs.","For the full year, adjusted expenses were down 1% compared to 2014 and have declined each of the past four years. In fact adjusted expenses are down 15% since 2011, evidence of our efforts to operate more efficiently. Separately, while not a non-interest expense point, I will highlight that the discrete tax benefits we have recognized in 2015 resulted in an effective tax rate of 28% for the full year, which is below what we would consider a more normal range in the low-30s. As we look to the first quarter of this year we anticipate personnel expenses to increase by approximately $100 million due to the typical seasonal increase of 401(k) and 5K expenses and also return to more normal accrual rates on incentive and benefit costs. In addition, our marketing and customer development costs will weigh more heavily in the first half of the year versus the second half as we are introducing a new campaign to further advance our purpose as a company. Bigger picture, after four consecutive years of declines, we expect 2016 expenses to be higher than 2015 as we expect revenues to improve. We will maintain our focus on the efficiency ratio and if revenue do not materialize we will have to adjust our expense base accordingly.","As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.2% in the fourth quarter, up slightly over the prior quarter and year. Our full year adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 62.7%, better than our 2015 target and 24 basis points better than 2014. For 2016, we are targeting revenue growth that exceeds expense growth and thus a tangible efficiency ratio that improves. That being said, the pace of improvement will be significantly lower than previous years as our core expenses have already declined substantially and the operating environment while improving in certain areas remains challenging overall. Nonetheless, we remain firmly committed to our long-term target of sub-60 %. And achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to our shareholders.","Turning to Slide 9, overall asset quality remains solid during the quarter evidenced by a 24 basis point net charge-off ratio and a 49 basis points NPL ratio. We did experience a deterioration in our energy portfolio, which when combined with the proactive NPL sales in prior quarters resulted in an NPL ratio that was 14 basis points higher sequentially, but very much in line with last year. As it relates to energy, not much has changed with regard to our exposure and mix. The energy portfolio is 2.2% of the total loan portfolio which is down 11% over the past year. The exploration and production and oil field services portfolios which are the most negatively impacted by prolonged low oil prices represent a little under 40% of the total energy portfolio or slightly under 1% of total loans.","Our reserves for the energy portfolio are approximately 4.5% and when isolated to the two most severely impacted sectors are near 12%. In addition, total reserves of $1.8 billion have been designated to cover inherent losses in our total loan portfolio. Losses in the E&P and oil field services portfolios will be elevated over the next couple of years and will thus cause overall C&I loss rates to rise from their low levels today. However, given all of the factors I mentioned we believe our energy related risk remains very manageable in the context of the overall company. The provision for credit losses increased $19 million sequentially and the ALLL ratio declined 5 basis points to 1.29% consistent with overall credit quality trends.","Looking ahead, we expect non-performing loans and net charge-offs to increase, primarily as a result of further stress on the energy portfolio. Despite this we would still expect the company\u2019s overall net charge-off rate to be less than 40 basis points in 2016. Provision expense this year will more closely match net charge-offs as the multi-year improvement in asset quality abates. Ultimately our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process which is informed by trends in all of our loan portfolios combined with the view on economic conditions.","Let\u2019s turn to balance sheet trends, average performing loans were up 2% sequentially driven by continued momentum in our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to lower levels of pay-offs. Commercial loan growth was broad based and driven by corporate, commercial auto dealer and commercial real estate clients. While consumer loan growth was driven by growth in direct, indirect and guaranteed student loans. The momentum in the consumer direct portfolio continues to be strong, driven by LightStream\u2019s, our partnership with GreenSky and further success with our credit card offering. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2 billion or 2% driven by 3% growth in C&I and 13% growth in consumer direct and was partially offset by declines in home equity, pay-offs in commercial real estate and reductions in indirect consumer loans given our focus on returns. In total, we have proactively sold or securitized approximately $5 billion of loans since the middle of 2014. Going forward, we will periodically sell or securitize lower return loans as part of our balance sheet optimization focus, though likely not at the pace of the past 18 months.","Turning to deposits on Slide 11, average client deposits were up $2.9 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 8% compared to the prior year, driven by growth across most lines of business. We are pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients\u2019 deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client facing bankers across both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale sectors. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within wholesale banking continue to do an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill referenced earlier our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.5 billion or 35% in just the past year. Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low cost deposit growth continues to be strong while higher cost deposits have been gradually declining. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will reverse. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position, which continues to be strong. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was up 9.8%. Tangible book value per share was stable sequentially and up 6% compared to the prior year driven by growth in retained earnings partially offset by lower AOCIs as a result of higher interest rates.","For our 2015 capital plan, we repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid a $0.24 dividend in the fourth quarter. In addition, we repurchased an incremental $39 million of common stock in December, which reflects our overall commitment to increase capital return to shareholders. We expect to repurchase approximately $350 million of additional common stock in the first half of 2016 to complete our 2015 capital plan. As a result of our capital return program, we are continuing to drive down share count. Average fully diluted shares outstanding were down 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Lastly, as of January 1, the liquidity coverage ratio is now a formal requirement. We have started the year in full compliance and we will of course maintain that status over the course of 2016.","Moving to the segment overviews, we will begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on Slide 13. Net income declined 6% sequentially as elevated market volatility resulted in lower wealth management-related revenue. We also had a modest increase in expenses driven in part by investments in our card offerings as well as various one-time items. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 4% annually benefiting from continued low cost deposit growth and our balance sheet optimization efforts. The strong growth in our consumer direct portfolios has afforded us the opportunity to sell, securitize or reduce production in lower return areas. Deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% for the full year, with much of this growth coming from deeper relationships with our mass affluent client base aided by our investments in premier bankers and the SummitView platform.","On a full year basis, CPWM posted strong net income growth of 8%, which is once again the result of strong deposit growth, our balance sheet optimization efforts and further improvements in credit quality. Loan balances declined 3% in 2015 as we sold or securitized approximately $2 billion of loans. But organic consumer loan production was solid and increased 5%.","Non-interest income declined 1% for the full year largely due to the headwinds wealth management faced in 2015, but also due to the continued decline in service charges. While current market conditions have made growing wealth management revenue more challenging, meeting more of our clients\u2019 wealth and investment needs continues to be a strategic priority for our company.","Expenses in CPWM have been well-controlled as we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing talent and technology. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments and expect this to increase as mobile adoption rates and digital sales trend upwards. Bigger picture, the progress we have made in optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. We are optimistic about the long-term trajectory of this business both as it executes against its strategic priorities and as the value of our strong deposit franchise is more fully realized in a normal interest rate environment.","Moving to wholesale banking on Slide 14, we had a solid quarter in spite of the challenging market conditions. Revenues were down 3% sequentially, but stable relative to the prior year. Much of the decline in revenue was driven by overall market volatility, which not only impacted debt origination activity, but also resulted in adverse mark-to-market impacts. Partially mitigating these impacts was strength in other product areas, such as equity originations, equity sales and trading and derivatives marketing, a reflection of the increasing diversity of our business model.","Net interest income was up 1% sequentially as a result of strong loan and deposit growth partially offset by margin compression. Overall, net income declined 9% sequentially as a result of the declines in non-interest income and increased provision expense. While we have been building reserves for our energy exposure since the fourth quarter of 2014, the prolonged low oil price environment will continue to place pressure on the provision expense in this business.","On a full year basis, we saw strong performance with a record year for wholesale bank, demonstrated by the 9% increase in net income driven by broad-based revenue growth partially offset by energy-related reserve increases. Net interest income was up 6%, driven by 8% loan growth and 16% deposit growth. The loan growth was broad-based across each line of business and most industry verticals partially offset by intentional reductions in lower return areas. The deposit momentum within this business also continues to be strong, evidence of the success our liquidity specialists within wholesale are having and the enhancements we have made to our treasury and payment product offerings.","Non-interest income was up 10% in part due to the 14% growth in investment banking income, where we had record years in equity originations, M&A, syndicated and leveraged finance and investment grade bond originations. The breadth of growth here is reflective of the investments we have made to expand our capabilities and thus become more of a strategic advisor to all of our wholesale clients. The tangible efficiency ratio improved further to 48.6% as we drove further operating leverage while also investing in revenue-generating initiatives.","In conclusion, while market conditions can be choppy quarter-to-quarter, we are encouraged by our differentiated business model within wholesale banking and are confident in the opportunities we have to expand our client base, meet more of their complex corporate finance and advisory needs and continue to grow our business.","Moving to the mortgage segment, revenues were stable sequentially as higher servicing income helped to offset the decline in production income. Net income declined $38 million as a result of the $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined by $22 million as a result of lower margins both in production and our held-for-investment loan portfolio. These declines were partially offset by an increase in servicing income as a result of portfolio acquisitions over the past couple of years.","For the full year, we saw $137 million increase in adjusted net income, which is primarily due to the significantly improved credit quality of the loan portfolio both as a result of the improving housing market and our proactive actions to de-risk the book. This improvement was partially offset by a decline in net interest income as a result of $2.3 billion of loan sales in 2014 and lower loan spreads in 2015.","Production volume increased by 38% in 2015, due primarily to higher refinancing activity, new purchase volume also improved in 2015, a broader sign of the continued improvement of the economies in our markets. We also grew the servicing portfolio by 5% as a result of portfolio acquisitions. In both production and servicing, we achieved our objectives of smart, targeted market share growth. I would also like to point out that we successfully switched to a new loan origination system in the second half of 2015, which facilitates a faster and simpler loan process for our clients and teammates, but also allowed us to more efficiently meet the new TRID requirements, which became effective October 1. This was a significant and important undertaking and we have already been able to use our success as a competitive advantage to attract new talent in several of our markets. Overall, the mortgage business continues to benefit from improving asset quality and good expense discipline, both of which have allowed this business to become a more steady contributor to the bottom line performance of this company.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Bill to share some concluding perspectives on our performance in 2015 and our outlook for 2016.","Bill Rogers","Great. Thanks Aleem. So coming into last year, we have several key objectives; continue to improve efficiency, further optimize the balance sheet in order to enhance returns, invest in growth opportunities and increase capital return. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in 2015 as we met each of these objectives. We grew earnings per share by a solid 11%, we met our efficiency ratio goal, we increased ROA by 5 basis points and advanced the revenue growth trajectory of many businesses, all in the context of managing the headwinds associated with the prolonged low interest rate environment. We also grew tangible book value per share by 6% and returned over 60% of our earnings back to our shareholders, continuing our path of improving capital returns.","Our performance is a reflection of the diversity of our business model, where each segment made strong contributions to enhance the financial performance of our company. Within consumer and private wealth, organic production growth and higher return portfolios and continued momentum on the deposit front has allowed us to further optimize the balance sheet. Our investments in digital have allowed us to better identify and meet more client needs while also extracting efficiencies from certain areas. In wholesale, our differentiated business model allowed us to absorb the impact of the more challenging market conditions in the second half of the year and drive strong high single-digit growth in revenue and net income. In particular, I am pleased with the more integrated One Team approach we delivered to our clients and that\u2019s evidenced by a 36% increase in capital markets revenue from the commercial real estate and private wealth businesses. This increase in client and product diversity will be an important contributor to the long-term growth of wholesale banking. And within mortgage, we benefited from the abatement of legacy mortgage related costs, but also from the targeted growth initiatives we have in place to grow production in servicing. The transition to a new origination platform was time-consuming and challenging, but I believe we have the right risk and operational foundation to place to further advance our mortgage business.","So as we look into 2016, we will remain focused on the same primary strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency, all with the goal of creating further value for our clients and shareholders. While the revenue environment is expected to improve, we expect credit cards will normalize in the non-recurring benefits we had in 2015 will abate. Subsequently, we will need to deliver positive operating leverage in 2016 in order to achieve our financial objectives and make further progress towards our long-term target of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. So to conclude, I would like to take a moment to recognize and thank all of our teammates for their key roles in delivering our 2015 financial results, many of them are on the phone today. Our team is diligently focused on fulfilling our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients, communities and shareholders. As we look into 2016, we will further advance this purpose, facilitating a dialogue about money in order to help Americans move from financial stress to control and ultimately to confidence. Our team is absolutely ready to go.","Now with that, I will turn it back over to Ankur and we will begin the Q&A portion.","Ankur Vyas","Dexter, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I would like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I was wondering if you can give us some thoughts on your framework in terms of when all said and done, how you think the energy book plays out in terms of either default rates or total NPL levels, what the loss content might be and any framework on that kind of would be helpful?","Bill Rogers","Well, Matt, let me take a crack at that. I think when you think about our energy book overall, it\u2019s helpful to think about the context. So you know our energy exposure overall is only 2.2% of our total loan book, first of all. Secondly, within that E&P and oil field services are 40%, so only about 1% of our total loan portfolio is in those two sectors which should probably be the sectors most negatively impacted by lower oil prices. Within that, now you think about, we have got about 4.5% of reserves against the entire energy book. So for those two segments, reserve levels are closer to 12%. So that starts to feel pretty good. And then thirdly, of course we have got total of $1.8 billion of ALLL in total, which is available to cover all of our loans. So as I think about what might happen here in 2016, \u201817, \u201818, we will see some increase in NPLs. We will see some increase in provisioning against our energy portfolio. But in the context of the rest of the book, where our resi mortgage exposure continues to get better and better and as charge-off levels and required reserves continue to come down, I think that our 2016 charge-off levels and provision levels for energy actually are looking very manageable.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then, just on the loss content, once the loan is moved to non-performer, can you remind us, do you take a charge-off on that and then what\u2019s potentially the eventual loss content, obviously not all non-performers are the same, but it takes a while for that to be clear, I think from the outside?","Bill Rogers","It does. I mean, it will take a while to see how all of this plays out. We build \u2013 we are building up our reserves for energy clients, up client-by-client. You actually made a great point in not all non-performers have the same loss content. You saw the increase in non-performing loans that we had this quarter. I ought to let you know that the vast majority of those non-performing loans are actually performing, they are still performing today. What we are trying to do here is be prudent and get ahead of the curve on non-performing loans the same way you saw us do in Q4 \u201814 when we tried to get ahead of the curve and start to provision early for energy. We are trying to do the same thing here in non-performing loans.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","John McDonald","Yes. Hi, just following-up on credit again, the outlook for net charge-offs less than 40 basis points is a bit away from the 24 basis points you did this quarter, recognizing that\u2019s a very low charge-off rate that you are at today, are you expecting it to kind of march up steadily? And is it the driver of your outlook for higher charge-offs really just energy or you have got some other normalization going on?","Bill Rogers","No, it\u2019s mostly just energy as sort of where I think the inflection is, John. We have been seeing now for several years that our charge-off levels are unsustainably low. Well, it looks like energy might be the catalyst to actually turn that around. So, I do expect that we will see more provisioning coming in the wholesale book in 2016, but I also expect the rise in provisioning will be mitigated by the releases that I expect to get out of our consumer and mortgage books in that as a result of resi mortgage improving.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. And outside of energy that increase was more of a macro combat. I mean to your question, we don\u2019t see any particular portfolio segment, geography however you might want to categorize it that we see a particular problem and it\u2019s more of a macro kind of non-energy compound.","John McDonald","Okay. So, you still could have some net reserve release in the beginning part of the year, Aleem. It sounds like the gap is going to close between provision and charge-offs, but you could still have a little bit of a gap?","Bill Rogers","Maybe, I am not sure yet, John. But if I think about the full year, I would think that our full year provision and charge-offs ought to be pretty close.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, thanks. Two questions. Just one more on the energy reserve and one on loan growth, on the energy reserve, you indicated the 4.5% and the 12%. Can you give us a sense as to how you think about oil price when you are making that reserve? Is that done on a forward basis, on a spot basis? And can you give us some sensitivities to, if oil goes down another $5 or another $10, what happens to the reserve there?","Bill Rogers","Well, the reserve is built as of December 31, Betsy. So at the time we used the oil price on that day, which was $37. That\u2019s the way the reserve was built. If oil stays down under $30 for a while, yes, we will expect that we will continue to see additional provisioning required. But as I said earlier, I think we will be able to mitigate some of that with the benefits we get out of the mortgage book overall. Our price decks as you know are pretty sort of consistent across the industry and we will be rebuilding our new price deck for the spring re-determination period very soon.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, no sense of just what kind of order of magnitude change we should expect or like should I just take whatever the reserve is that you have done today than have another half or given an expectation for if oil stays at $30?","Bill Rogers","I don\u2019t have a great sense of that for you yet, but it will be well into eight figures, maybe even get into nine figures in total provisioning over a multiyear period, which in the context of the total PPNR for the company and releases will be coming out of mortgage, I think they are very manageable.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And just the follow-up was on loan growth and C&I had a nice inflection this quarter, maybe you can speak to the drivers there, was that just less asset sales or more of originations, context would be great?","Bill Rogers","Yes, it\u2019s interesting, because we have sort of talked about loan growth being an outcome versus something that we are managing. And if I look at production over the last few quarters, it\u2019s actually been very consistent and at a consistent high level. In the fourth quarter, in particular, we benefit a little more from some lower pay-downs, so pay-downs were a little less in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We had a slight increase in the utilization rate. I don\u2019t want to mark anything there, but there was a slight increase in the utilization rate. So, it really is just a \u2013 it\u2019s a reflection of all the things we have been doing within the case of the fourth quarter, just a little less headwind than we have had in the previous quarters.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Good morning. I just want to level set on the starting points for the expense side, I got your point about the step up the annuals, the quarterly step up and then the marketing in the first half and taking your points about driving to operating leverage. It seems like we had a great end to the year and we have that normal step-up. So \u2013 and I know we ask this question a lot, but can you just help us frame kind of the starting point and then I presume we kind of still have that ramp down throughout the year. Is that the right way to think about it?","Bill Rogers","Well, that would be a nice way to think about it, but of course, it depends on the revenue environment. If the revenue environment improves in \u201816 relative to \u201815 as we are currently anticipating, I think that will be the driver of expenses increasing \u201816 relative to \u201815. If I try to think about, Ken, an average number and of course, it\u2019s going \u2013 this is going to be volatile quarter-to-quarter. But if I try to think about an average number for the year, I would probably be thinking about something that would be closer to something like $1.35 billion on average, some quarters higher, some quarters lower and improving slightly, improving efficiency ratio as that revenue appears. If the revenue environment does not improve, then we will have to adjust expenses accordingly. And in that case, I would start thinking about a number lower than that, maybe closer to the $1.3 billion.","Ken Usdin","Yes, understood. And then just a follow-up on that is you guys have done a great job over the past couple of years rightsizing shrinking branch count, etcetera, how much flexibility would you have in that tougher environment? We don\u2019t want to anticipate happening, but like is there a lot of opportunity set still inside if that were to be the case?","Bill Rogers","Well, this is Bill. I mean, I think the opportunity still exist, because we are still on the path to sub-60. So, we have plans underway for expense management in virtually every category. So, it\u2019s not like they are not on the shelf already, our ability to execute against them would really mean. In fact, we are taking a little more risk speeding them up in terms of terms [ph]. So, we have those plans in mind.","Aleem Gillani","Ken, you may have seen the press announcement we had in the last few days about changes in our real estate footprint in Raleigh and in Richmond, we are moving to new space. We will take our total number of locations in those two cities from 11 to 5 between \u201816 and \u201817. We will reduce our square footage in those areas by 50% and we will create a better environment for our teammates. Just as a sort of a point of info, we have been \u2013 you said, we have been working on branch count and office space reduction over the last several years. We have actually taken out 2.5 million square feet over the last 4 years out of our physical footprint and we continue to be on that path. Between now and 2018, we will stay on that becoming more efficient with our use of space.","Bill Rogers","So to answer your question, I mean, we think we have got the flexibility on the expense versus revenue achieved in the efficiency ratio target long-term. It doesn\u2019t exactly work perfectly quarter-to-quarter. I mean, that\u2019s the point that I would want to make. But we can look ahead and adjust the levers accordingly.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Maybe I could just follow-up on Ken\u2019s question, if we were to have expenses coming in at $1.35 billion you are going to imply something like mid single-digit growth. And Aleem, given your comments around positive operating leverage, that implies revenue growth should be north of 5%. I was just wondering maybe can you talk us through the components of revenue growth? How should we think about NII growth? What does it mean for the net interest margin over the last couple of quarters? And on the fee side, how do we think about the split between wholesale and consumer fees? Clearly, consumer will likely be under pressure as you make some changes. Markets have come down. So, may be that will hurt the wealth business, but just trying to contextualize how to think about the different moving pieces on revenue growth?","Bill Rogers","Thanks Ryan for the question. So, if you think about NII overall, for the last several years, it\u2019s been essentially flat, maybe even coming down a small amount and that\u2019s been the effect of declining NIMs essentially being offset by production and growth. Now that NIMs are no longer declining and we are looking for NIM to be essentially stable for 2016, that underlines our organic loan production and growth on both assets and liabilities is going to start to show through. And as that shows through, I think we will see NII start to climb in \u201916, sort of as it started to do in \u201815 after the first quarter. So I think that will be where you see the growth in revenue. On the fee income side, you are right, we are not really expecting growth in consumer service charges, that\u2019s not going to be a growth area for us, but the growth that we have seen overall in wholesale will continue, I think will continue to appear. The One Team approach that we have got, our ability to meet more of our clients\u2019 needs across more products and be a bigger, more of a strategic advisor to more clients, I think continues to show up. So I think that will be helpful. And I think mortgage will also become a more sort of consistent contributor to the bottom line. So that\u2019s where revenue will appear.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then maybe if I could just follow-up on one other question, given where your reserve is on energy and the E&P and oil field services book of 12% and which I think is well above a lot of your peers, I guess how should we think about the comment that you made that we should expect continued reserve builds from here. And more specifically, if oil prices stayed at these levels, what would be realistic loss content over a 2-year period, I heard what you said to Betsy, but I am just trying to understand like why would losses in your book be at that type of level relative to peers you were talking about levels that are half of what you are commenting on?","Bill Rogers","Well, you know us, we are inherently a conservative company and we would try to think conservatively. So I don\u2019t know where peers are or what they have got in their book. We are trying to be careful and make sure that we stay ahead of this overall. I think our reserve levels are very prudent for where we are right now with oil at this stage in the cycle. But remember, we set these reserves when oil was $37. And if oil moves into the $20s, we will have to take account of that and I would think that the farther oil moves down, the loss content starts to become asymmetric for the industry.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Bill Rogers","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Well, can\u2019t wait for the Super Bowl to see your ad.","Bill Rogers","Great.","Mike Mayo","But it comes in the context of 4 years of expense declines and now expense is going higher as you just discussed. So it\u2019s the same question I asked last year and you got your target. But if we don\u2019t get rate increases, do you think you can still grow revenues faster than expenses and you gave some specific examples about those locations. But if you could say, what are the few main reasons why you think you can improve efficiency if that is the case without rate hikes?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I think Mike, as we went into last year we were a very clear about saying we were going to improve efficiency irrespective of rates. So we sort of said take that off the table. Now it looks like we are only projecting two rate hikes and one at end of the year. So I think we are still taking a pretty conservative approach to the impact of rate hikes. And we are continuing to make the statement that we are going to stay focused on improving our efficiency ratio. Now in fairness, it grinds down slower. So there is no doubt about that. I mean we got sort of a big junk and it grinds down slower. But we are not backing off, we are not wavering or anything I guess the commitment to continue to improve on the efficiency side.","Aleem Gillani","Mike, in terms of some of the things that we continued to work on expenses, to be clear, we are not saying that we are taking our foot off the gas pedal on managing expenses. And we are still looking at overall operations costs. We are looking at call centers, lending centers. We are still looking at technology infrastructure and how we can continue to improve our efficiency there. I mentioned that we introduced a new mortgage origination platform late in 2015 and I anticipate that, that will help our overall efficiency and effectiveness within the mortgage segment. I mentioned we continue to work on optimizing our real estate footprint and we will continue to do that now through \u201818 and \u201819, I expect. And look, across the whole company, we are staying disciplined on how we manage roles, responsibilities. We have a very clear pay for performance philosophy. I think that shows up for \u2013 across our teammate profile. And of course we continue to consolidate our suppliers. So we are working on managing our third party supplier profile. So none of this is meant to say that, hey we are declaring victory on expenses, what we are saying is that as we move forward the big rocks on expenses, I think we have achieved and we are going to be more balanced to going forward in terms of revenue growth and expense management.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Aleem, I want to ask you on your guidance on net interest margin being I think a little inconsistent, so I just want to make sure we connect the dots right, you came into the year in first quarter of \u201815, you had a 2.83 margin, which improved to 2.98 by the time you get to the end of the year, which would average 2.90, you are saying you are going to improve 3 basis points to 5 basis points in the first quarter. And so when you are looking at that kind of trend, your net interest margin would have to significantly be above in 2016 versus 2015 unless expense going downward from the first quarter through the end of 2016?","Aleem Gillani","That\u2019s right Marty, that\u2019s exactly what I was trying to say. I am sorry, if I was unclear. I do expect...","Marty Mosby","Just a little more flat year-to-year, which you really got a \u2013 already a lot of improvement in there and I was also wondering about you said if you had another rate hike in the middle of the year, if you wouldn\u2019t see the margin improve over the first quarter, when you are already getting some benefit from rising interest rates, there would be seems like another catalyst or margins to go up again on that next, just one more rate hike in the middle of the year?","Aleem Gillani","I do think that will help. So to be clear on my margin expectations, Marty I think the first quarter margin will go up from the fourth quarter. And I think that\u2019s sort of 3 basis points to 5 basis points or so. And then from there for the rest of the year, I am expecting it to be generally stable to the first quarter number, to the increased higher margin level, assuming we get that one rate hike in the middle of the year. The offset to that, so that\u2019s \u2013 the rate hike is going to be helpful and we are asset sensitive. And we are asset sensitive actually at every key rate duration point across the curve. So that will be helpful. The offset to that is competitive pressures are still strong. Spreads continue to be tight, if anything grinding maybe at a bit tighter, but sort of trying to stabilizing a little bit relative to the decline we saw in spreads over the last year. And we still have old mortgages and old securities that will continue to roll off the books that will have to reinvest that new lower rates. So there are mitigants to the rate rise, which I think will put a cap on margin. But I do think year-over-year, margin will be higher and Q1 to Q4 margin will be higher.","Marty Mosby","And then as a follow-up on the asset quality side, you are talking about being conservative in a sense that you got performing loans that somehow you are pushing into non-performing, I didn\u2019t really have any foreshadowing of this in the delinquencies, can you give us some feel for the migration of how $200 million ended up in non-performing this particular quarter and your thought process around that deterioration? Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Yes. Thanks for the question, Marty. We are just trying to be a little bit careful here. The majority of the loans we put into non-performing are actually still performing today. They are performing loans, but these are loans when we look at those particular clients, we think that there is a risk that they will become non-performing some time in the next couple of years if oil stays where it is. Remember how quickly this move has been on oil, right. And so it\u2019s only 15 months ago, we were at $100 a barrel. So, the move has been very, very rapid and we are just trying to make sure that we try and stay ahead of this, so that we don\u2019t end up surprising you and ourselves later.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Ankur Vyas","Dexter, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our last question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Going back to energy, sorry, the \u2013 regarding the increase in the NPAs, can you just tell us what types of credits they were or the E&P or service that went on to NPA? Also were they shared national credits and do you have the average size of the credits that moved on or the number?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, it was just a handful of credits, John. I don\u2019t know if they were shared national credits, but it was a relatively small number and they were all either upstream or services.","John Pancari","Okay. And again, the increase in the charge-offs this quarter that was related to the energy book as well?","Bill Rogers","Yes, some of it was. There was one charge-off in energy that related to one credit.","John Pancari","Okay. And then the non-energy or the non-oilfield service and non-E&P types of loans that you are including in that energy-related classification, what is that? Is that utilities and coal?","Bill Rogers","That\u2019s mostly midstream and downstream. So, when you look at midstream and downstream that makes up the remainder of what we call the energy book. And when you think about what lower oil prices do for midstream, it\u2019s sort of a nonevent and for downstream, it\u2019s actually beneficial. And so for our downstream clients, the decrease in energy prices will help them.","John Pancari","Okay, alright. And then lastly also within the energy topic, do you have your total criticized ratio within your energy portfolio? And then also how much of your energy book is investment grade versus non-investment grade?","Bill Rogers","Well, John, let me answer those backwards. The investment grade versus non-investment grade, I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me, but as you would expect, we have a relatively higher proportion than others of investment grade, so think about the context maybe of a third to a half of our book would actually be investment grade. And as you would also expect when you think about a conservative underwriter like SunTrust, the criticized portion would be relatively low and for us that\u2019s on the order of 20%.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly, the first lien versus second lien, do you have that?","Bill Rogers","The vast majority of our loans are first lien. The vast, vast majority of our loans are first lien.","John Pancari","Okay. Alright, great. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","Operator, this concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter, and then turn it over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem's comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level, and then of course we will take some Q&A.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.78 on net income to common of $411 million. That was up 7% per share relative to a year ago. Overall this quarter results were solid with good performance in certain areas including continued expense discipline, higher mortgage and capital markets related income, strong credit quality, and further deposit growth momentum. These favorable trends helped to counter act the decline in a net interest margin over the past year.","Total revenue declined compared to both prior quarter and prior year entirely due to the lower net interest income, much of which was anticipated, as the prolonged low interest rate environment continues to pressure asset yields. Partially offsetting this was an improvement in non-interest income driven by an increase in mortgage and capital markets related revenue.","Current quarter expenses were relatively stable to the adjusted level in the fourth quarter as seasonally higher personnel costs were offset by reductions in most other operating expense categories, though portion of these declines were seasonal or non-recurring in nature. More importantly, expenses were down 3% from the prior year adjusted level as a result of continued expense management efforts, lower operating costs -- lower operating losses, and the sale of RidgeWorth.","The combination of these revenue and expense trends resulted in an adjustable tangible efficiency ratio of 64.4% for the current quarter slightly below the first quarter of last year. As we noted in January, year-over-year improvements in 2015 will be less than last year as we continue to work towards our goal of being sub-63 for the full year.","Average performing loans were stable sequentially due in part to loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay down activity in the current quarter, but also due to our strategic focus on overall returns. While we remain confident in our loan production capacity and improving the economic conditions in our markets and businesses, our focus on returns will remain high, and may impact ultimate on balance sheet loan growth.","Average client deposits were up 3% compared to the prior quarter with broad-based growth across consumer, private wealth, and wholesale businesses. Our core growth initiatives are gaining momentum, driven by improved focus, better execution, and enhanced capabilities.","Asset quality continues to be an area of strength. Non-performing loans were down 3% from prior quarter, and 34% from prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points, relatively stable to the prior quarter and year.","Our capital position improved with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.8% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Also tangible book value per share continues to steadily increase up 2% sequentially and 10% compared to the prior year.","Lastly, our capital plan that we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process, received no objection by the Federal Reserve. Our common stock dividend will increase 20% subject to Board approval, and we will repurchase $875 million worth of common stock over the coming five quarters, which is 55% higher than our previous share buyback authorization. We're pleased that our strong capital position, improved earnings power, and reduced risk profile enabled this positive outcome for our shareholders.","So to recap year-over-year trends; net interest income declined, most of which was related to the anticipated step-down in the commercial loan swap income, non-interest income trends are solid, and it more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth revenues.","And lastly, expenses continued to be well-managed, and asset quality is strong, both of which played an important role in mitigating the pressure on the margin, and thus keeping us on an overall positive trajectory.","So with that as overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details.","Aleem Gillani","Thank you, Bill. Good morning everybody, and thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments on Slide 4. Earnings per share in the first quarter were $0.78, which was $0.10 lower than the fourth quarter on an adjusted basis, and $0.05 or 7% higher than the first quarter of last year. The sequential decline was driven by lower net interest income and seasonally higher compensation expenses, and was partially offset by higher mortgage-related income and lower provision expense.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, EPS growth was driven by the continued expense discipline, a lower provision expense, and higher mortgage and capital markets related revenue, which together more than offset the decline in net interest income, and the return to a more normal tax rate. In addition, certain discrete recoveries, which I will discuss later also contributed to the solid year-over-year EPS growth.","We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail, starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined $73 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily driven by the anticipated decline in commercial loan swap income and two fewer days, but also impacted by higher premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio. Net interest margin declined 13 basis points, primarily due to lower swap income, and the higher premium amortization expense, but also due to continued core margin pressure as a result of the low interest rate and competitive environment.","Relative to the guidance we provided in January, the higher premium amortization expense negatively impacted NIM more than we had anticipated, as ten-year rates declined another 30 basis points sequentially. Conversely, mortgage-related revenues benefited from the decline in rates, which I will discuss later.","Core C&I loan yields, excluding swap income declined seven basis points as new production yields continued to be lower than portfolio yields. We remain focused on ensuring that we both meet the full suite of our wholesale clients' needs, and also our own internal requirements. When we cannot achieve this we will look to either exit the lending relationship via targeted loan sales as we've done in the past couple of quarters, or simply not participate during future renewal opportunities.","On a year-over-year basis, net interest income declined $64 million, primarily driven by the same factors as the sequential drivers, but partially mitigated by 7% average earning asset growth.","Looking forward, and all else equal, we expect second quarter net interest margin to decline approximately two to four basis points from the first quarter level, driven primarily by lower C&I loan yields. We have been and will continue to carefully manage the usage and duration of our overall balance sheet in light of the continued low interest rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rates.","Moving on to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income increased $9 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by higher mortgage production and trading income, which offset seasonal declines in other non-interest income categories. Mortgage production income increased $22 million, due to higher production volume as a result of elevated refinance activity and improved gain on sale margins. On the other hand, mortgage servicing income declined to $10 million as the K expense increased, given the first quarter decline in market rates.","Investment banking income declined $12 million sequentially largely due to typical patterns of client activity between the fourth and first quarter. However, the $97 million in investment banking income this quarter is a record for a first quarter, with particular strength in investment grade debt and equity capital markets businesses. Trading income increased $15 million as a result of both higher client activity levels and the negative valuation adjustments in the prior quarter.","Service charges for the deposits and card fees were collectively down $13 million, due both to fewer days in the quarter and reduced incidence rates. Other non-interest income was higher, almost entirely due to an $18 million pre-tax gain recognized upon the sale of legacy affordable housing properties. As you'll recall, we recognized an impairment last year when we made the decision to exit these properties. Market values are now higher and those sales are now largely complete.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income increased $12 million, as higher production income and capital markets related revenue more than offset the loss of RidgeWorth income.","Moving on to expenses, adjusted non-interest expense increased $16 million relative to prior quarter. Personnel expense increased a $100 million sequentially, as a result of typical first quarter FICO and 401k costs, as well as the return to more normal levels, and incentives, and benefit accruals.","Outside processing and software costs declined $17 million as the fourth quarter had elevated expenses mostly due to normal timing patterns of rendering service, and costs associated with replacing specific software. Marketing and customer development expense also declined $16 million due to typical seasonality.","Other non-interest expense declined $35 million, due to higher legal and consulting costs in the fourth quarter; alongside, $17 million of discreet recoveries realized in the first quarter. Operating losses declined $15 million on an adjusted basis in part due to recoveries of previously recorded mortgage-related losses.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense was down 3%, driven by a combination of the sale of RidgeWorth, discreet recoveries in the current quarter, and our continued overall discipline around expense management.","As you can see on Slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 64.4% in the first quarter, 50 basis points better than last year. We delivered this improvement despite the expected $50 million step-down in commercial loan swap income, as adjusted expenses were lower by 3%. As we have noted before, improvement in 2015 will be more challenging, given our significant progress last year, in addition to lower commercial loan swap income this year. However, our performance this quarter demonstrates solid progress towards our goal.","We continue to remain focused on the efficiency ratio and our goal of being below 63% for the full year, and as such, we will continue to exhibit strong expense discipline in light of the current revenue environment.","Turning to Slide 9; our asset quality performance continues to be strong, non-performing loans declined 3% sequentially, and are down 34% compared to the prior year. The net charge-off ratio was 30 basis points in the first quarter, stable with previous quarterly levels as charge-offs continue to stay low. However, recoveries were lower than the run rate experienced in 2014.","With respect to our energy portfolio, we have not seen any meaningful delinquencies or defaults. During the quarter, we updated credit ratings, resulting in some migration, and we expect that to be ongoing, which is why we have proactively built reserves for this portfolio.","Our allowance for loan and lease losses and provision expense declined $44 million and $19 million respectively, compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality combined with the lower loan growth during the quarter. Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio.","Net charge-off ratios are likely to remain within the 30 to 40 basis point range in the near term, though any given quarter may be impacted by discreet items particularly driven to those low overall net charge-off rates. We now expect full year 2015 provision expense to be below full year 2014 expense, as asset quality continues to improve, which s modestly better than our previous guidance.","As you know, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which is informed by trends in our loan portfolio combined with a view on future economic conditions.","Let's turn to the balance sheet. Average performing loans were stable relative to last quarter, as a result of loan sale activity in the prior quarter and elevated pay downs in the first quarter, in addition to lower production as a result of our continued focus on returns. C&I loan growth, while somewhat slower, was positive and broad based, driven by our corporate, commercial and small business clients. Consumer direct loans were also nicely higher, given continued growth in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership.","As you'll recall, we sold $2 billion of loans in the prior quarter, which impacted sequential average growth rates. In addition, we moved approximately $400 million of loans to held-for-sale in the current quarter, which modestly impacted end of period growth.","On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $5.1 billion or 4%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios outside of the residential, guaranteed student, and indirect auto portfolios where the declines are consistent with our balance sheet optimization goals of better diversification and higher returns.","Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients' growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. We will also continue to keep the high focus on improving returns, and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.","Turning to deposit performance; average client deposits were up $3.6 billion or 3%, compared to the prior quarter, and 9% compared to the prior year, driven by broad-based growth across all of our lines of business. We're pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall focus on meeting our clients' deposits and payment needs, supplemented by investment in client-facing platforms and people across both our consumer and private wealth, and wholesale segments. Rates paid on deposits were stable sequentially and declined by three basis points compared to the prior year.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $200 million during the quarter as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the Basel III common equity tier 1 ratio estimated on a fully phased-in basis, increased to 9.8%.","Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter, and a full 10% compared to the prior year, due primarily to growth in retained earnings. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2015 CCAR process. The capital plan includes the share buyback program of up to $875 million over the coming five quarters, which will be conducted relatively evenly on a quarterly basis, in addition to a 20% increase in our quarterly common stock dividend, from $0.20 to $0.24, subject to Board approval. Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016 requirement of 90%.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","Bill Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll start on our Slide 13. In our consumer and private wealth management segment, revenues were up 2% compared to the prior year, due predominantly the higher net interest income. Average loans have been relatively flat, however, we've had solid growth in our higher return portfolios such as consumer direct and credit cards, which has offset the intentional reductions we've made in the indirect auto and guaranteed student portfolios. This shift in portfolio mix is consistent with our overall strategy to improve returns across the company.","Also contributing to the increase in net interest income was 7% year-over-year deposit growth. Our improvements in deposit growth can be attributed to a more relentless focus supplemented by additional teammate investment, particularly in our mass affluent high net worth segment, and better technology with our SummitView platform, being one of the notable examples.","Non-interest income declined 6% compared to the prior quarter, largely due to seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income was essentially flat.","While retail investment income growth diminished a bit, the quality of this income line is improving as a higher percentage is related to client assets under management versus more transaction-based revenue. Growing wealth management related income overall continues to be a strategic priority.","Expenses were up 2%, compared to the prior year, largely due to increased outside processing costs and certain discrete non-recurring charges. Staff expenses remained relatively flat, as ongoing efficiency savings offset continued investments associated with the revenue growth initiatives.","Lastly, despite solid 4% year-over-year growth and pre-provision net revenue, net income was down 3% as provision expense increased due to moderating asset quality improvements. However, overall asset quality continues to be very strong in this segment.","So to recap, this is a difficult operating environment for this business as you know, but we're generating good core momentum for the long-term. In the near term, continued expense discipline will be important to help combat the revenue pressures associated with low interest rates and consumer service charges.","Turning to whole sale, whole sale banking continues to be a key growth engine for the company. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 18% year-over-year, driven by solid revenue growth and further asset quality improvement.","Adjusted revenue grew 8% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up 9%, driven by broad-based loan and deposit growth, though this was partially offset by a decline in loan spreads. Loan growth was 2% sequentially and 15% year-over-year, driven by growth across most of our client segments. However, given the competitive environments and continued low rate environment, C&I production yields continued to be pressured, and as such, we reduced growth or sold loans in the areas that are not meeting our long-term return hurdles.","Deposits were up 4% sequentially and 12% year-over-year, and the success here can be attributed to enhancements and our treasury and payment product offerings, along with the success of our liquidity specialist hires, both allowing us to uncover and meet more of our wholesale clients deposit meets.","Adjusted non-interest income was up 6% over the prior year, driven by higher investment banking and trading revenue reflecting the investments that we've made in talent and capabilities to increase our market share. Authentications and leverage finance volumes were down year-over-year, investment grade debt and equity capital markets at record quarters, and overall, as Aleem mentioned, this was our best first quarter for investment banking income. This overall performance is a testament to the enhanced diversity of our platform both by product and industry, and as a result of the continuous investments we've made in the business.","Going forward, we're focused on leveraging investments in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey to better meet the capital markets and advisory needs of our commercial banking CRE and private wealth clients. Adjusted non-interest expense was higher year-over-year largely due to the investments in CIB; however, this business continues to have an efficiency ratio which is very accretive to the overall company.","Overall, we continue to believe that our wholesale banking business is highly differentiated, and our value proposition continues to be very well received by clients. Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we're working hard to mitigate that impact by being more selective about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continue to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities.","Looking forward, our clients remain confident, our investment banking backlog and loan and deposit pipelines are healthy, and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for the segment.","Now moving to the mortgage segment, where we had another good quarter. Adjusted net income was stable to the prior quarter, but up 42 million over the prior year. Our expense base continues to decline while our risk profile is improving, both of which are key components of our strategy in this business.","In addition, a strong refinance environment boosted production income in the first quarter. Getting into the details, revenues were up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher mortgage production income as a result of a 64% increase in production volume and higher gain on sale margins. Compared to the prior quarter, revenues were basically flat. The higher production income was offset by higher decay in the servicing portfolio, and lower spreads on the loan portfolio, a reflection of natural hedge within the business.","While mortgage production volume was up 8% sequentially, application volume was up 48%, which should support elevated levels of production income into the near term. The current refinance environment will abate when rates begin to rise, however, we expect purchase volume and our operating market will continue to strength, given overall economic conditions. Our expectation is supported by purchase volume and applications being up 16% and 30% respectively year-over-year.","Adjusted expenses were down 5% sequentially and year-over-year despite higher revenue, primarily due to declines in operating losses and another cyclical cause. Additionally, asset quality continues to improve with delinquencies, non-performers, and net charge-offs continuing on a declining trend.","So to summarize the quarter for the overall company, we had a solid momentum across each of our businesses, which help mitigate the impact of the persistently low interest rate environment on our net interest margin. Our focus on returns will remain a priority, and the capacity we build throughout the company should help us to continue and deliver profitable growth.","In addition, we're mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and improve our efficiency ratio. This expense discipline will also be important to help fund continued growth investments, many of which are already yielding positive results, so that we can continue to deliver long-term value for our clients and our shareholders.","Now with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Bill. Arlene, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning, guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","You've now had the third solid quarter of expense control under $1.3 billion, and clearly there was that $17 million recovery, and you also mentioned the operating losses were much lower. I was wondering as you look out now, have you gotten us down to a sub 1.3 quarterly expense run rate, and if not, what are the upward pressures that we would see from here?","Bill Rogers","Yes, Ken, this is Bill. As you pointed out, we've been operating clearly at the low end of a range we established, which was sort of a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. And I think we will continue in that lower end of our range, and I think a $1.3 billion subject to some variation is honing in on more of the right number, given where we are in this environment.","Ken, you know how focused we are on the efficiency ratio, and if you do the math when you look at the decline in revenues and so what the revenue environment looks like for us to hit our efficiency ratio targets, we'll have to keep a tight lid on expenses, and therefore the bottom end of that range looks more likely relative to the size of the full range we had previously given.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And Aleem my follow-up just on a comment you\u2019d made last quarter, you had been talking previously about running also in the 1.2 billion-ish on NII. This quarter it looks like you started a little bit below that, maybe partly because of day count, but kind of a same follow-up just where we kind of also stuck at this sub 1.2 level, just given where we are in the rate environment for now?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think yes, the day count was an issue this quarter, Ken, and also the premium amortization this quarter on the securities portfolio was an issue just given the big lurch down in rates that we got this quarter, 30 basis points on the ten-year.","So I think if you take those two things out, and I think about what NII looks like over the course of the remainder of the year, you know what we've been actually very successful in holding NII stable despite declining margins for many quarters until we got to this quarter, we got to step-down this quarter because of the decline in swap income, but from here I would think that we are -- if this isn't the trough in NII, then this is very close to the trough.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from John McDonald from Bernstein. Sir, your line is open.","John McDonald","Yes, hi, good morning. I was wondering on the mortgage side, the production revenues as you noted were quite strong on both volume and margins. I was wondering if you could offer any color on the timing of the volume pick-up, was that steady throughout the quarter, was it sporadic based on where rates were? And then on the gain on sale margins, any numerical context you could offer for how strong your gain on sale margins have been, and what's been driving that? And do think you can hold these gain on sale margins here?","Aleem Gillani","Hi, John. Yes, I think that we saw that decline in rates early in the quarter, and that helped us on mortgage revenue overall, and production volumes were generally steady throughout the quarter. Margins picked up a little bit early in the quarter and sort of, I think, held relatively steady also fairly throughout the quarter.","So if rates are where they are, then I would expect this to continue for a while, but also the refi benefit I think continues to decline a little, just given how many of our clients have already refied. And over time, the benefit we expect to see from an improving economy is actually our clients moving more and more toward a purchase market, and we are looking forward to seeing that happen.","John McDonald","Okay.","Bill Rogers","Yes, I'm more excited about the purchase opportunity going forward. I mean the refi thing, with service in [decay] [ph] it sort of tends to even itself out a little bit. So I mean the real long-term sustainable growth comes from purchase. And what we're seeing maybe it\u2019s unique to our markets, but we're seeing really good activity on the purchase side.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks. And a follow-up just to Ken's question, Aleem, in terms of the premium amortization, do you get that all back one-for-one if the ten-year climbs back and your outlook for the second quarter, the two to four basis points of margin, does that assume any recapture of the premium amortization you lost this quarter?","Aleem Gillani","If rates climb, we'll get some of it back. We probably won't get it all back on a one-for-one basis, John, but we're not anticipating a major rate hike in the next quarter or two.","John McDonald","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Rob Placet","Hi, good morning. This is Rob Placet from Matt's team. First question just on investment banking, revenues continued to be strong there. I was just curios if you could provide an outlook on a full year basis, what we should expect there?","Bill Rogers","Well, we don't tend to provide a full year outlook as it relates to that particular line, but that being said, given what we see right now in pipelines, given what we see in activity, what we\u2019re feeling from our clients, we continue to feel really good about that business. It's got quarter-to-quarter type fluctuations. But if you do sort of a straight line for us over multi-quarter, you're seeing a continued improvement, and given the investments we've made there, the receptivity from our clients I don't see a reason that wouldn't continue.","Rob Placet","Okay, great. And then just similar question on deposit service charges; they were a bit weaker than I think we were expecting, so I was just curious if you can provide an outlook on that line time?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. They were a little bit lower, primarily again, we had two fewer days this quarter, as well as we're seeing changes in client behavior. Our clients are consolidating accounts and they're looking to try to find ways of avoiding fees. And we're working with them to do that. We're educating our clients on what they can do. And we think that over the long run that's going to help our overall client relationships and help build the franchise.","So if I look at deposit service charges over the remaining part of the year, they will be driven a little by client behavior, but I think we're looking for ways to try and work with our clients. And this is not going to be an overall growth area for the company, but we are looking to try and find ways to work with our clients and help them manage their exposure, and we think that will help our relationships in the long-term.","Bill Rogers","They're obviously inversely related to deposit growth. We've seen really good deposit growth in not only new account acquisition, but just increase in balances and individual accounts.","Rob Placet","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is open.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Ryan Nash","All right. Can you tell me little bit about the loan growth you saw this quarter, where the slowdown came from, particularly on the commercial side which is where I think you have one of your slowest quarters in a while, just how big were the elevated pay downs in the quarter?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I'll take that Ryan. C&I was up about 2% this quarter overall. In most of our core verticals, we continue to see some pretty good growth. Some exceptions to that, particularly in areas where we've been focused on returns, equipment leasing would be one of those. Some of that's involved with the loan sale of some muni assets that we just didn't see being as strategic long-term as we wanted.","CRE was flat this quarter. That was mainly from pay downs, and that sort of is a two-edge sword. I mean the one edge is it reduces the growth a little bit, but the other edge is it's a nice confirmation of our business. So we got pay downs from construction activity, and investor demand being very good. So the things that we're financing are very financeable in the secondary market. So that's positive.","I think going forward on the C&I side, I mean we continue to be positive. I think the pay downs were probably a little higher this quarter than certainly than we've seen in the past. Production engines will continue to be positive, might not be at the same level as last year, but it continues to grow.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Aleem, you noted two to four basis points of NIM pressure in the second quarter; just given the focus on relationship pricing, clearly seen, are you still under pressure? Do you think that two to four is going to be a good run rate option, any changes to the swap portfolio to the remainder of the year? Or could we actually see the pressure start to ease, like I said just given the focus on getting better pricing across your customer base?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think that's a question about sort of economy and markets. And if the economic growth picks up, and I think that amount of decline will decline. But if we stay as we are, all else equal, I would think that kind of a margin decline two or three basis points a quarter is about sort of a kind of grind down that we would continue to see, given run-offs and new production over the remainder of the year.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najaria","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Erica.","Erika Najarian","My first question is actually a follow-up to Ryan's question, so throughout your prepared remarks you mentioned several times that you continue to want to keep your return hurdle tied, you think about balance sheet growth, and you also noted that C&I loan growth may not be as strong as last year, at the same time wholesale banking continues to be strong and your particular market are also quite strong. As we think about loan growth for the balance of the year, compared to last year, and we mix all of those together, could you still have accelerating loan growth despite some of what you've pointed out?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Erica, yes, I think we can have good loan growth in our markets. You know the markets we are in, where we've got great opportunity. We've certainly put a lot of investment in great talent that we've been fortunate enough to bring in over the last couple of years. I think that's going to help us on the loan growth side. But to your question about returns, I think along with loan growth and net interest income of course is fee income. And I think our strategy around being able to grow non-interest income from bad client base to whom we provide a value proposition that they like, I think we've been able to demonstrate that we've been able to deliver that, and it gives a testament to the talent we brought in. And our investment banking results this quarter I think demonstrate that strategy is working well for us.","Bill Rogers","And I think there is no putting breaks on the production engines. We'll continue to fire on all cylinders in making sure that we are seeing the kind of opportunities we want to see. One of the big trade-offs in the overall balances are in the consumer private loan side, and I really like the trade. Our consumer direct business was up about 9% and our indirect was down about 8%, and I like that trade. It's more client-related business, it's higher margin business and continued sort of equal credit quality. So I think that kind of trade on the balance sheet particularly as it relates to consumer side is something that we'll continue to be focused on.","Erika Najarian","Understood. And just for my second question, taking a step back; M&A is a bigger topic with bank investors today than even a quarter ago, given your level of excess capital and the environment being challenging for all banks, do you see yourself as a potential acquirer over the next 12 to 18 months? And how has that mindset perhaps changed versus, let's say, a year ago?","Bill Rogers","Well, I think the continued investment right now is in our business. The bank that we like the most is SunTrust. We've got third biggest retail operation in our markets, the fourth largest mortgage company. We've got great momentum in our investment banking operations. So we are going to continue to invest in those things, funded by some of the expense savings and opportunities that we are creating.","I presume without the green light if we wanted to do something on the M&A side, where we think about things that are potentially accretive to a really strong franchise, yes, but those are not a lot of them. So, 12 and 18 months is a long time. Our focus right now continues to be highly and mostly focused on SunTrust.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","Just couple of quick follow-ups; one was on the loan sales this that you did this quarter, did you slice them [ph]?","Bill Rogers","I'm sorry, Betsy. I didn't hear the\u2026","Betsy Graseck","Did you slice how much the loan sales were? I'm just wondering what the growth was ex the loan sales.","Bill Rogers","All right. We sold $2 billion towards the end of Q4. And in Q1, we moved another $400 million into held-for-sale.","Betsy Graseck","And then, I'm just also wondering is, are you through that process? Is there more to come? How you're making decision which ones to sell, relative value on the risk adjusted margins, just to bring [ph], but how far along in the process you're?","Aleem Gillani","You're exactly right. We're looking for relative value. We're looking for lower ROA or ROE loans. We're also looking for loans that as Bill said earlier are more in the indirect space, loans where we don't have a client relationship with that client. We refined loans that fit those categories. We'd rather put our capital to work for clients where we do have a relationship, and where we get returns to hit our hurdle rates.","Betsy Graseck","And so just that basic question is that are you pretty much donor, or this is ongoing which you expect a type of level of loan sales that happen on a quarterly basis?","Aleem Gillani","We're doing an ongoing research, Betsy. And if we find portfolios of loans that fit our sale category, then we'll be continuing to look for exit on those loans and put our money to work where we think it actually makes more sense. If you go back over the last couple of years, I think you'll see sort of us on a pretty steady basis, moving lower ROA assets out of our balance sheet, not to somebody else's.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, and the follow-up is just on the impact of some of the regulatory rules around; leverage lending, and I know you have a very strong business there. Maybe you could speak to how you see that shaking out, especially as energy has pulled back a bit in terms of need for funding?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I think you're certainly seeing some shake out of the market. That's not the biggest driver of our income going forward. It has been a driver. I think we've participated in a very thoughtful way that's very consistent with our strategy of being highly diversified, and both inter and intra parts of our portfolio. I think overall it's positive. Overall I think we're seeing a little bit of a pull back to what we've seen a couple of quarters ago, and I think overall for business in general, that's a positive, and it will be a positive for us.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","I just wanted to get a little more color on what all the detail that you gave around loan growth and the pay down etcetera, and what that means for overall growth in coming quarters? I know there's been some questions about it on the call already, but is it fair to assume that you're going to be in a growth rate in the mid single-digit as you have been in prior quarters, or are the pay downs and some of your selectivity and what you're putting on the balance sheet, could that weigh on it near term or we could be looking at low single-digits?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think, John, the important part is we're going to grow in the areas that we want to continue to grow at. And they have been growing. If we look at areas like core commercial and our corporate banking business, and as I said virtually all of our verticals, we were seeing real growth. We would expect that to continue. That's been offset a little bit this quarter, maybe uniquely by higher pay downs in the CRE sides, which we discussed, which again sort of on balance I view as positive in terms of the confirmation of our business model, and then also with the decision that we made in the fourth quarter relative to particular loan sales.","So trust me, as I said earlier, we're not putting brakes on loan growth. I mean we'll continue to be very positive about the businesses we're in. We're very positive about the markets we're in, and continue to see opportunities in that area. And much of what we're doing is meeting our hurdle requirements, and a lot of it's meeting our hurdle requirements because of the investments we've made on the fee-based side. The fact that we have come a long way from a spread-only business, we're able to generate a lot more income of the commitments that we make on the asset side.","So we continue to feel good about the capacity to generate loan growth in this company, and I think the first quarter is just a little bit above an aberration in the sense of pay downs and then fourth quarter loan sales that are all culminating in one particular quarter.","Aleem Gillani","John, if you go back last year, you'd see that we were putting on about $2.5 billion of organic loan growth every quarter. And if you wanted to continue to generate that, given the strength of our production engines, I'm sure we could easily do that. The issue is at what returns. And given our focus on overall returns, I don't think that we will choose to grow loans at the same rate that we were last quarter; certainly not the rate of Q1 '15, but probably somewhere in the middle between where we were this quarter and where we were last year.","John Pancari","I'm sorry, Aleem, you just said, versus fourth quarter last year?","Aleem Gillani","Well, all of last year, we were putting on an average of about $2.5 billion of loan growth per quarter.","John Pancari","Yes, okay. All right. And then my follow-ups in the expense side; thanks for the detail around the overall $1.3 billion level. In getting there, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the different components, specifically operating losses, obviously came in lower than expected. The outside processing and software costs also lower, and then I know credit and collection was lower and that was part of your other classification. So for those types of items, all fair to assume they stay low and they're the main drivers of your confidence around this $1.3 billion?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, there was a little benefit in operating losses this quarter. That was sort of little bit of a one-off, but overall we're focused on every one of those lines, we continue to work with our teammates across the company around improving overall efficiency ratio, finding dollars of expenses that we can cut in those contexts. We've talked in the past about all of our various strategies, all of the things that we're focused on to continue to manage expenses and grow efficiency. And we talk less about those now, but that doesn't mean that had gone away. We continue to focus on that, and I expect that we'll continue to do that over the remainder of the year, John.","Bill Rogers","Yes, John you mentioned a few line items which are somewhat cyclical by nature. And I think continuing the trends that we're on, we should overall, maybe not quarter-to-quarter, but overall see those continue to go down as the quality of our portfolio improves. But then as Aleem pointed out, there is everything else. This is the core way we run our business. I mean lots of focus on operations costs, looking at lending centers, call centers, technology infrastructure, end-to-end focus, and virtually all of our businesses, corporate real estate consolidation, use the third-party, the vendor management, the list goes on. We're highly focused on more than two or three lines that relates improving that expense line. But we also noted, the focus is on the efficiency ratio because we're all fantastic, so we're sort of in the \"Save a dollar, invest a dollar,\" kind of mood right now, because we see lots of opportunities to continue to invest in our company for long-terms growth. And we're going to be careful about hitting that right balance of not cutting in to the sort of the core revenue capacity opportunity in our company; again, which I think are significant long-term.","John Pancari","Yes, got it. Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Sir, your line is open. ","Jason Harbes","Hi, good morning. Actually it's Jason Harbes from Matt's team.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Jason Harbes","Good morning guys. So yes, first question is just on the swaps. Looks like you upgraded the guidance by about 10% for the full year. Just curious what's driving that and what your appetite would be to purchase additional swaps within the context of rates potentially rising later this year.","Aleem Gillani","Well, I'm not sure rates will rise later this year. But yes, as you noted we did add a little bit more into that portfolio. But remember how many we had rolled off in the first quarter, and given the way that our portfolio looks structurally, and if we did nothing at all, 60% of our overall loans would be floating rates. We continue to want to add swaps to move some of that portfolio to what looks like fixed rates. And as a result of the swaps that we have on the book now, we're more like 50-50. We've got what I think today is a nice balanced that prepares us to be asset sensitive for some point in the future.","I'm not so sure that point in the future is going to be soon, i.e., in the next few months, but I think is you look at 2016 and '17, our investors are going to want us to be asset sensitive, and I think swap structure and overall structural rate book allows us to be nicely asset sensitive at that point.","Bill Rogers","And I think Aleem mentioned that we mentioned in January, coming into this year, we geared our planning process. I'm not thinking about a rate increase. So when we talk about efficiency ratio, we talk about the things that we have control of, we're assuming we're going to be in a low rate environment. Now, if that changes, we obviously get the benefit of that, and we're obviously positioned for that long-term, but I would not dependant on a rate increase, for example, to hit our sub\u201363 efficiency ratio.","Jason Harbes","Okay, that's very helpful. And then to switch over for my follow-up on the credit card business, looks like you're making nice progress there. Can you comment specifically on what you're seeing there and maybe share any insights into the appetite of your customers to revolve balances?","Bill Rogers","Yes. It is part of that; a direct portfolio that were seeing grow on our consumer side, and we're actually very pleased with what we seeing on the credit card side. Not only way we're putting more cards, and everybody's wallet was actually being on that track now pretty consistently for about 12 to 18 months. But as you point out, we're actually now starting to see utilization. So some of the things that we're doing to activate that with different campaigns and process that we're running to making sure that we've got reward programs and et cetera that are highly competitive, and we're just seeing clients starting to shift that is their overall usage to a more fulsome relationship that they have with SunTrust versus maybe a single relationship they have with somebody else with the cards in their wallets. So I'm hopeful that trend will continue, and I like the momentum we've established.","Jason Harbes","Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Sir, your line is open.","GerardCassidy","Thank you. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","GerardCassidy","Can you share with us on your ability to purchase up to $875 million, now, of your common shares between the second quarter 2015 and 2016? Is that going to be a straight line even amount per quarter, or will it be variable? And plus, if some opportunity came up to buy stock more aggressively, if it's not in your CCAR plan, can you still do it, or do you have to apply to the regulators to say that you want to do it?","Bill Rogers","Well, Gerard, I'll answer your second question first. Overall, program is regulated quite rigorously. So if we wanted to make dramatic changes, I'm sure we would be having a conversation.","And coming to your first question, I expect that to be relatively even over the five-quarter period, and the first quarter of this year, we repurchased a $115 million of stock. And I'm pleased with the increase over the next few quarters that was not objected too, and I'm glad that we'll be able to bring that stock in.","GerardCassidy","Coming back to your Tier 1 common ratio, which is very strong at 9.8%, first, what are you comfortable at running at? And second, I know this is putting the cart before the horse, but for next year's CCAR program, if you feel you have excess capital, what is the possibility or probability that you'd ask for -- to buy back more than your current earnings, which American Express, for example, did this year?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I like what we were able to do this year, Gerard; we took our overall payout ratio from the 50% range up to the 70% range. So that was nice to be able to do. And given the context of continued loan growth, we would need to retain some level of capital in order to be able to support the loan growth that we are going to get this year.","As I look forward to where we think we can be at some point in the future, I do think like you, that 9.8% overall, and remember this is on a fully phased-in basis. That's probably more than we'll need, and I would hope that over the course of the medium term, that the regulators would allow the industry to be able to shrink capital level overall. If I think about where we could end up in that type of environment, I think that we would likely end up as some kind of ratio below nine; something that starts with an eight probably seems like it would be certainly adequate for the need that we have as a company to support our client needs, and be able to withstand the rigorous CCAR stress test.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. I appreciate the answers, Aleem. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","Aleem, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. A couple of questions on fee income; firstly on mortgage, I'm getting a sense that you're gaining share there, and if so, how are you doing it?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I think maybe the -- if we sort of think about it on a global basis or national basis, I think our marks up is just better. We are seeing, we are covering our markets, particularly on the purchase side. So on a national type basis, I would presume that we'd be gaining share because I think our economy is gaining share in our markets relative to the total economy. So I think the answer to that is probably yes. And we continue to add LOMs [ph] to our platform. I mean we like what we're doing, we're optimistic about the future. We like the way our business is operating. So we will continue to make those types of investments, but just overall I think our markets are just better. And we will continue to invest in technology in the platform. And as we continue to do that, we make it easier and easier for our clients to do business with us, and for our teammates to support those clients. So that past investments I think is paying off in terms of client delight with our products.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then in the release, you touched on a slowdown in syndicated finance activity, and you mentioned leverage lending being a little bit lighter. What do you think is behind that? Is it demand? Is it regulators getting tougher, is it something else?","Aleem Gillani","I think a little bit of that is just seasonality, Q1 versus Q4. It's a little bit of a standard thing that clients move ahead in Q4, perhaps late in the year to close our transactions. So I think a little bit of that is seasonality, but I think we were able to more than offset that decline in that space with growth in other aspects of our investment banking business that allowed us to generate the results that we got this quarter.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great. Thank you very much.","Ankur Vyas","Okay, thanks everyone. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

You may begin.","Ankur Vyas","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed within the Investor Relations section of our website, www.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our Executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, www.suntrust.com.","Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Ankur. So usual, I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for details on the consolidated results. I'll then wrap up my comments by reviewing our performance at the business segment level.","Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $0.72 on net income to common on 387 million. Earnings per share were negatively impacted by certain non-core items this quarter, primarily the resolution of the HAMP investigation, which was partially offset by the sale of RidgeWorth, our asset management subsidiary. We'll discuss both of these items in further detail later in the presentation. And where appropriate, we'll discuss our financial results on an adjusted basis to make sure the underlying core story is more clear.","The net impact of these items was a negative $0.09. And excluding them, earnings per share were $0.81 or net income to common of $436 million. This represented 19% growth in EPS compared to the second quarter of 2013 and was also 11% higher than the previous quarter. Our results this quarter reflected solid performance across a number of key areas, including continued broad-based loan growth, good deposit growth, increased non-interest income and strong asset quality performance.","Adjusted revenue increased 3% over the prior quarter and was relatively unchanged from prior year. Looking at the component parts, net interest income was relatively flat as the benefit of loan growth was offset by a decline in loan yields. Adjusted non-interest income increased $66 million relative to the prior quarter with solid growth across a number of fee income categories, most notably in investment banking. Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest income was relatively unchanged as higher investment banking and retail investment income negated the decline in mortgage related income.","Adjusted expenses were slightly higher than the first quarter as the seasonal decline in personnel expenses was offset by modest increases in certain cost categories and higher operating losses. Compared to the prior year, adjusted expenses were down 4% due to a decline in cyclical cost and our continued focus on overall disciplined expense management.","Maybe more importantly, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio declined 130 basis points sequentially and 230 basis points compared to the prior year. The sequential process reflected the solid revenue momentum we generated this quarter, which is we've said before will become an increasingly important component of achieving our efficiency ratio goals. Our performance this quarter brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 64.2%. And while this keeps us on track to achieve our better than 64% goal for the full year, it certainly does not reduce our focus on executing the revenue and expense initiatives throughout the company.","Average performing loans increased 2% sequentially, driven by growth in our C&I, commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. In particular, I'm pleased with the breadth of our loan growth as it's across many industry verticals, lines of businesses and geographies. This is the result of our concerted efforts to better diversify our business mix. Average client deposits were also up 2% compared to the prior quarter with a favorable mixed shift towards lower-cost deposits continuing.","Our credit quality performance continues to be on a positive trend. Non-performing loans declined 3% from the prior quarter and 21% from last year, while the net charge-off ratio remained steady at 35 basis points. We also completed some modest balance sheet management actions this quarter in order to reduce risk, improve the liquidity and increase long-term returns. Aleem will cover the details of these actions later in the presentation. Finally, our capital position remains solid with tier 1 common estimated to be 9.7% on both the Basil I and Basil III basis.","Our recap, we achieved core operating momentum across each of our businesses, while maintaining strong fundamentals in the form of our asset quality and capital position. Completing the sale of RidgeWorth and resolving key legacy mortgage matters allows us to more firmly focus our efforts on expanding and deepening our client relationships and improving the profitability of our company.","I'll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more details.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Before we delve into our normal review of operating performance, I'll quickly review the significant items that impacted this quarter's results.","First, we completed the sale of RidgeWorth, which resulted in a $105 million pre-tax gains, which is modestly higher than the amount we advised when we announced the transaction. Second, we reached a definitive agreement with the government to resolve claims related to SunTrust Mortgage's administration of HAMP, which resulted in a $204 million pre-tax charge. And lastly, we recorded a $25 million net benefit related to the progression of certain previously disclosed legacy mortgage matters.","Excluding the impact of these three items, which in aggregate were negative $0.09 per share, earnings per share were $0.81, which as Bill said was 19% higher than the prior year and 11% higher than Q1 of this year. The year-over-year increase was driven by growth in investment banking income, higher mortgage servicing income given lower refinance activity, and improved asset quality, which benefited both the provision expense and our adjusted cyclical costs. These positive trends more than offset an $81 million decline in mortgage production income.","The sequential quarter earnings increase was driven by broad-based growth across most non-interest income categories and a decline in the provision expense due to improved asset quality, which more than offset a return to a more normal effective tax rate this quarter.","We'll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income was generally stable relative to the prior quarter as solid loan growth was balanced by loan yield compression. Net interest margin declined 8 basis points, primarily due to a 7 basis point decline in loan yields. The decline in loan yields was most notable in our C&I book, though we also felt this in our non-guaranteed residential mortgage and indirect auto portfolios. The drivers of our loan yield compression are a mix shift as wholesale banking is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the portfolio and continued competition in our markets and businesses.","While loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower, this is an isolated view that does not capture non-interest income and deposit revenue. Our focus is on meeting the full suite of our clients' needs and maintaining a disciplined view of entire relationship returns.","Securities yields declined 10 basis points sequentially due to a combination of lower reinvestment yields and higher premium amortization in the quarter as MBS cash flows increased. Compared to the second quarter of 2013, net interest income was also relatively flat as the aforementioned combination of loan growth and loan yield compression neutralized each other. Net interest margin declined 14 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower loan yields, though modestly offset by lower deposit costs and higher securities yields.","Looking forward, we would expect full year 2014 net interest margin to decline compared to 2013, albeit at a slightly lower pace than the decline from 2012 to 2013, which was 16 basis points. This is primarily due to continued compression in loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income. You will recall that as our commercial loan swaps mature over the next few years, we become more asset sensitive, which is a conscious design of our balance sheet management strategy over the medium term.","Moving to Slide 6, adjusted non-interest income increased $66 million from the prior quarter, driven by broad-based growth across most fee income categories. Investment banking was the notable driver of growth, up $31 million sequentially, with strong client-driven momentum across most products and businesses. Mortgage production income increased $9 million sequentially or 21% as closed loan production increased 31% and gain on sale margins declined slightly.","Mortgage servicing income declined $9 million sequentially due to higher decay of the MSR asset, a result of increased prepayment speeds during the quarter. Retail investment services continued its positive trends, resulting from our ongoing focus on meeting more clients' wealth and investment needs. Trust and investment management income declined $14 million sequentially, driven entirely by the loss of RidgeWorth's revenue stream during June. For the five months ended May 31st, RidgeWorth contributed approximately $20 million to SunTrust's pre-tax income.","Service charges for deposits increased $5 million sequentially, primarily driven by normal seasonal patterns between the first and second quarters. Card fees were also up $6 million or 8% as our clients are increasingly seeing the value proposition of the SunTrust card offering.","Other non-interest income excluding the sale of RidgeWorth increased $27 million sequentially, primarily driven by a $19 million gain from the sale of government guaranteed mortgage loans, the details of which I will cover on Slide 10. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income was flat, as growth in mortgage servicing, investment banking and retail investment services counteracted the lower mortgage production income.","Let's now move on to expenses on Slide 7. Adjusted non-interest expense increased $17 million relative to the prior quarter and declined $49 million relative to the prior year. Personnel expense declined $37 million sequentially, primarily driven by the anticipated seasonal decrease in 401(k) and FICA related costs. This decline was offset by $11 million in higher outside processing and software costs and $5 million in marketing expenses, both of which are typically lower in the first quarter. In addition, other non-interest expense, excluding the $36 million legacy affordable housing impairment in the first quarter, increased $24 million driven by higher legal and consulting fees alongside of certain discrete asset write-downs.","Lastly, adjusted cyclical costs increased $21 million sequentially, primarily driven by an increase in operating losses, which as we have stated in the past can be variable. Excluding operating losses, we would not expect significant variability in cyclical costs going forward. Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest expense declined $49 million, which was primarily driven by lower cyclical costs and our continued focus on expense management, partially offset by higher personnel expenses which is primarily the result of targeted hiring and revenue producing positions.","As you can see on Slide 8 and as Bill mentioned, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved 63.6% from 64.9% in the prior quarter as the revenue growth we delivered in the quarter was greater than the modest increase in adjusted expenses. This brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 64.2%. We will need to continue to execute on our revenue and expense plans to achieve our less than 64% target for the full year 2014. Our long-term efficiency ratio target continues to be below 60%.","Turning to credit quality on Slide 9, asset quality metrics remained favorable this quarter, though sequential quarter improvements continued to moderate. Non-performing loans declined 3% sequentially and 21% year-over-year, driven primarily by continued improvements in the residential loan portfolio. The net charge-off ratio remained at 35 basis points. We sold $149 million of accruing TDRs this quarter that further enhance our asset quality position.","The financial impact of the TDR sale included $10 million in net charge-offs, a $16 million reduction in the allowance and therefore a $6 million reduction to the lower mass provision. While the TDR sale will not materially change our reported asset quality metrics, it will have a modest positive benefit on certain rating agencies and regulatory calculations. Improvements in asset quality and the TDR sale were the drivers of a $37 million sequential decline in the allowance, a 3 basis point reduction in the allowance ratio and a $29 million decline in the provision for credit losses.","Going forward, we would expect continued, but modest improvements in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We would also expect net charge-offs in the residential portfolio to drift modestly lower in the near term. However, commercial and consumer net charge-offs are already at or below normal levels and will at some point revert to the mean. Over the near term, we would expect the allowance to remain generally stable as any asset quality improvements may be counterbalanced by loan growth. And as a result, the loan loss provision should roughly approximate net charge-offs. However, as you know, the ultimate level of reserves will be determined based on our rigorous review processes.","Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10, average performing loans increased $2.3 billion or 2%. Growth was driven by the C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios and partially offset by a slight decline in the residential portfolio. C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by the commercial auto dealer group alongside increases across most CIB industry verticals. CRE loans were up 8% sequentially due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and a portfolio acquisition. Consumer loans were also up modestly, given growth in our consumer direct, indirect auto and credit card portfolios.","Average residential loans declined approximately $600 million, driven by legacy asset run-off and the impact of targeted balance sheet management actions. We sold $325 million of government-guaranteed mortgages this quarter, which resulted in the aforementioned $19 million gain reported in other income. We also sold $149 million of accruing TDRs, which I previously discussed. In addition, we transferred $2.1 billion of government-guaranteed mortgages to loans held for sale in anticipation of selling those loans during the third quarter.","We currently plan on reinvesting the proceeds of the government-guaranteed mortgage loan sales into high-quality liquid securities that are compliant with the forthcoming LCR requirements. We expect the resulting balance sheet profile to be revenue-neutral and LCR-positive. Pro forma for these actions we expect to be substantially compliant with the proposed LCR rules issued last year.","Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $9.8 billion or 8%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. We continue to do our part to support our clients and to help grow [ph] the income.","Turning now to deposit performance, average client deposits were up 2% compared to the prior quarter and 3% compared to the second quarter of 2013 as solid growth in low-cost deposits was partially offset by timed deposit run-off, in particular maturities of our higher-cost CDs. This continued favorable shift in deposit mix helped move interest-bearing deposit costs down by 2 basis points and 6 basis points respectively compared to the prior quarter and prior year.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Tier 1 common equity expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings, while the estimated Basil III common equity tier 1 ratio stayed stable at 9.7%. Tangible book value per share increased 3% from the prior quarter and a full 10% compared to the prior year due to the growth in retained earnings and higher AOCI.","During the period, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20 per our previously approved capital plan. In addition, we repurchased $83 million in common stock, which was modestly lower than originally planned, given guidance the industry received from the Federal Reserve in the second quarter. This guidance limits a bank holding company's ability to make capital distributions to the extent, but its capital issuances including employee share-based compensation are less than the amount indicated in its submitted capital plan.","Given this new guidance and our forecast for employee-related share-based compensation, our gross four quarter buyback program will be approximately $50 million lower than the $450 million maximum in our original capital plan. The net share dilution impact from this change is immaterial.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the business segment performance.","Bill Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. The core operating momentum generated in each of our business segments helped drive the overall solid quarter corporate results we've discussed this morning. And our consumer banking and private wealth management business net income was up 7% compared to the prior quarter and prior year. The momentum in this business is improving in both non-interest income and from lending activity.","I'm pleased with the growth in retail investment income as it's evidence of the partnership between our Premier Banker's branch managers and financial advisors all centered around better serving the savings and investment needs of our branch-based clients. Card fees are also up due to higher purchase volume related to clients' increased utilization of our credit card product. Our focus in these areas is particularly important, given the pressures on more traditional consumer banking related fee income sources.","Consumer loan production was strong this quarter, up 18% year-over-year, driven mainly by growth in our credit card and LightStream businesses. This growth however continues to be muted by run-off in our home equity portfolio. Provision for credit losses declined both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by continued improvement in the asset quality of our home equity portfolio.","Expenses were up 6% in this segment compared to the prior year, driven primarily by targeted investments in revenue-generation positions, particularly in the wealth and investment side of the business in addition to some smaller discrete charges incurred in the current quarter, all of which are focused on improving the long-term efficiency ratio.","We continue to make progress in this segment. Our investments in technology and people combined with early efficiency initiatives and continued credit improvement are tracking positively against the impact of low rate environment.","Now let's take a closer look at our wholesale business. Our wholesale business posted a very strong quarter with net income up 7% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. In particular, we delivered a record performance in investment banking fees, which was the primary driver of the notable non-interest income growth during the quarter. Our performance here is reflective of consistent investments we've made in CIB over the past few years. The recent success can be attributed to expanding product capabilities as M&A and equity related revenues in particular were more accretive to our overall capital markets product performance. We're also doing a better job of serving our corporate and commercial banking clients' capital markets needs, which is evidence of our improving client reach.","Net interest income increased 6% year-over-year due to good loan growth and deposit growth. The continuing declines in loan yields counterbalanced some of this growth. Wholesale loan growth momentum continued as average loans grew 4% sequentially and 15% year-over-year. Loan growth was broad based led by CRE, commercial auto dealer, corporate banking expansion activities and CIB's asset securitization and energy practice groups. Deposit growth was also solid with increases across each line of business.","Our pipeline has also increased this quarter, which is normally a good predictor of wholesale loan growth prospects that are for the remainder of the year. Competition however remains tough, which may lead to ongoing pricing pressure. Our focus will remain on serving our clients, financing the growth needs, while ensuring we earn an appropriate overall relationship return. We continue to invest in our wholesale business to broaden our client base and better serve their needs. We've opened offices outside our traditional regional markets and are pleased with our progress thus far in our ability to attract talent and business. More broadly, we're optimistic about the growth and profitability outlook of this segment.","Now moving on to mortgage, as we previously disclosed, we resolved certain key legacy mortgage matters this quarter. First, we announced definitive agreements with the government to resolve FHA related origination matters alongside the national mortgage servicing settlement. Secondly, as discussed earlier, we entered into a settlement agreement regarding our administration of the HAMP modification program. These agreements resulted in significant cost, but settling them was the right course of action for our shareholders, team mates, communities and clients.","Excluding the impact of legacy mortgage matters this quarter, mortgage banking net income increased 17% sequentially. Getting this business to a level of sustained profitability is an important goal, and this quarter's performance is another step in that direction.","Taking a closer look at revenue, non-interest income increased sequentially as higher production income and the gain on sale of guaranteed mortgage loans more than offset the decline in servicing income. Total closed loan volume increased 31% sequentially, driven by increased purchase originations associated with the spring and summer selling season. Adjusted expenses were stable sequentially, a solid accomplishment that reflects the continued focus on our cost saving efforts which neutralized the higher cost typically associated with improved production.","Provision declines continued given the ongoing improvement in the credit quality of the residential mortgage portfolio. The mortgage market continues to improve, albeit at a lower rate than we and the industry had initially expected at the beginning of the year. The market continues to be supportive by good overall affordability, though inventory level's building activity in the amount of first time home buying continued to dampen broader mortgage origination volumes.","With the resolution of additional legacy mortgage matters this quarter, we can further sharpen our focus on meeting more of our client needs and generating sustained profitability in the mortgage segment.","So in summary, this quarter's consolidated performance reflected solid momentum across each of our businesses, particularly on the revenue side. Our markets are exhibiting favorable macroeconomic trends and housing continues to improve. Our clients from consumers to small business to corporate feel increasingly positive about their prospects and we continue to invest in our team mates and businesses to ensure we can light the way to their financial wellbeing.","Ankur, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks. Wendy, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question today is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Just if I can start on the efficiency ratio, as we think about the back half of the year and into 2015, I guess first for the second half, I know you guys were looking at $1.5 billion worth of expenses. While it doesn't sound like you're going to be giving us formal cost targets there, is there any of that in the current run rate and should we expect to see another step-down in costs from that program? And then second, I know you're probably not ready to give us 2015 guidance at this point, but can you just talk about what you think some of the key levers are going to be for you to make efficiency improvement in 2015 just given the $235 million-or-so fall-off from swap income?","Bill Rogers","Most importantly, what we're continuing to focus on is our below-64% efficiency ratio for this year. And I think we made some good progress this quarter. As we highlighted, we're going to start reaching inflection points where we want revenue to be a larger component of that efficiency ratio. Achievement in this quarter was while maybe not the inflection point, maybe good evidence of the starting of an inflection point.","As it relates to the ops costs that we've talked, sort of $1.5 billion that we're underway, I mean we have roughly 100 different specific projects against all of those opportunities. And they're in the type of areas you'd expect ATM, consolidation of how we process, call centers, lending centers, vendor relationships, check image and branches. The list sort of goes on and on as they're set up to up to 100 different things.","The reason that we've been careful about assigning a number to that I think is probably evidence in this quarter, because we're going to make sure that we continue to also make the investments long term and our ability to achieve the revenue that we need. So I feel good about where we are on the ops cost. How much of that will actually manifest itself in '14 will really be dependent on sort of how we look at our additional investments on the revenue side.","Aleem Gillani","So let me come back to the expense point just for a moment. Part of your question was will we see another step-down. And I think the answer to there is generally no. We saw the big step-down already and that was from 2012 to 2013. And you saw what we did then was take a full 13% out of our expense base between sort of '11 and '12 rate now into the '13 and '14 rate. So the big step-down in costs I think has already happened.","In the near term, as I look at our overall expense base, we're managing it within that sort of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion level quarterly and that of course is revenue dependent. If revenue stays where it is or falls, you'd see that number come off a little. If revenue moves up considerably, you'd see that expense number probably move up to where the top end of that range. And I think you saw a little bit of that this quarter when revenue is this quarter up about $60 million and expense is up about $20 million. So that kind of a ratio, that's a trade we'd take any day to continue to grow our improvement in efficiency and continue to get the efficiency ratio down. As you heard Bill say, that's what we're really focused on, becoming a more effective, more efficient company and a little bit less orientation toward the exact expense number.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","And if I can ask one follow-up, more longer-term, when we think about your asset sensitivity, I know we've spent a lot of time talking about the impact of the swap roll-off over time. However, when I look at Slide 9, you've done a lot to improve the deposit base and you highlighted that in the prepared remarks. And we've heard peers talking about a pretty wide range in terms of potential outflows. So just can you remind us in your plus-3.2%, what you're assuming for both outflows and deposit betas? I think on my math, you were at about a 60% beta last cycle. However, given some of the improvements that you've made in the base, I would expect that to be lower this time. So any color you can provide there would be helpful.","Aleem Gillani","Yeah, of course, it's really difficult to say, because it depends very much on exactly how the rate cycle changes, how rates move, whether it's more long rates or more short rates or whether they go in parallel, what the economy looks like at that time. Having said all of that, when we think about it and we think about the last time around and what could happen this time, it seems to me that we're going to see deposit betas mostly for the industry in that sort of 40% to 70%. To your 60% number I think is dead on. But I would also say that given the enormous amount of liquidity there is in the system that deposits rates probably lag somewhat as overall rates go up, that there's probably no need for deposit rates to move up quickly as overall rates move up. And so I think this time could be a little bit different as we think about what betas look like, just because there is so much more liquidity overall in the system this time.","Bill Rogers","And, Ryan, I think you're accurate to point out all the change in the construct of our deposit base as well. I mean on deposits now are less than 15% of our total deposit base. So there has been a lot of change. And as you can imagine, deposit betas is a rich discussion that we have maybe daily in the company.","Operator","The next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","Steve Moss - Evercore","This is Steve Moss for John. Regarding loan growth here, you guys sounded a bit more optimistic in terms of the overall balance sheet trends. Should we look for a pickup here with regard to loan growth? And then the second part, I did notice that the commercial real estate loan growth did slow. Wondering if you could give some color on those dynamics?","Bill Rogers","I mean this was a very good loan growth quarter. We indicated that we're optimistic about pipeline and things that we see. But I want to be careful about sort of taking this quarter and extrapolating it long term, because it was a very, very particularly good quarter. As it relates to CRE, it's going to just be bumpy on the way up. It's up 42% sort of year-over-year. So any one individual quarter, based on something we might do off a smaller base, is going to be a little bumpy. So I still feel very good about CRE. I feel very good about the track we're on, quality of the assets that we're adding and the long-term opportunity. I haven't changed my view on that a bit related to this quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","My first question is just about net interest income. It looks like, Aleem, to your point about the core compression, you're kind of running in place on a core NII basis if I take out the hedge benefit. And noting your slide with the updated data, can you talk us through whether or not it's reasonable to expect core net interest income to grow from here? And with the loan growth, can you see any acceleration in core growth or will the core NIM compression keep you kind of just running flat for now?","Aleem Gillani","I think you almost gave up the answer right in your question. Obviously NII is overall very loan growth dependent. As we look at loan growth and as we look at a continued grind downward in NIM, we are expecting and we hope to be able to deliver NII that does continue to grow year-over-year. The full year this year, we're expecting and we hope we will be able to sell more than last year. But as you said in your question, it is loan growth dependent. Our frontline team mates have been able to deliver a very steady nice loan growth to us so far this year. And if we can continue that, we are looking to see NII continue to move up and offset that decline in margins.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Is it fair to say that that's a trend that you could expect next year, because I know it's early to give explicit guidance on next year? But the swap roll-off looking to be about $240 million or so next year, do you think you can also produce NII dollars growth on a reported basis as you get into '15 as well?","Aleem Gillani","Well, that's what we're going to be working hard to do. Obviously, again very economy dependent. But if the economy does continue to grow the way we expect and we're able to meet more client needs across more of our footprint in all of our segments, then that's what we're going to be targeting.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Just my follow-up on that will just be then on the NIM on the core, you mentioned all-in NIM being down a little bit less than this year. But do you see the core NIM stabilizing any time soon from that loan yield compression or is there just until rates go up a kind of continued drip in the NIM?","Bill Rogers","Ken, that's a really good question. I think there is a continued drip in the NIM for now. But if you assume that rates don't fall anymore from where they are today, I do think NIMs will start to stabilize in 2015. They will grind down between now and then. But assuming overall rates don't fall anymore between now and then, I think we will see stabilization next year.","Aleem Gillani","We always tend to delink NII and non-interest income, and I think they need to be better linked. I mean you can see the focus that we've had on building out our fee capability, probably CIB and investment banking or the most notable examples of that, but they're linked. So we see good growth in C&I loan growth. It's under a lot of margin pressure. But you can also say we're driving a lot more fee income off that loan base. Our average fee is up about 30% year-over-year. So our effectiveness and sort of moving from that right side to that left side and being more impactful for what we can do for clients, those two things are linked. I think it's important to maybe think about them together.","Operator","The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","Your capital is obviously very strong. And when you came through the CCAR, I think your capital was reduced by less than 200 basis points during that process. What's your guys' view on what's a comfortable tier 1 common ratio that you want to get to once we finally get through these CCARs and everybody knows what to expect in a year or two?","Bill Rogers","I think over time we're getting more and more clarity on this as the regulatory view and the industry view converges. I'll tell you I don't think we have perfect clarity today, but I'm feeling better about where we are today relative to where we were a couple of years ago. If I think about where I think we'll end up, you've got to start with the regulatory numbers, you have to start with 7. Add on a sort of potential SIFI buffer, whatever you think that will be. And then we'll have our own internal board that buffer on top of that, of course because we never want to go through the SIFI buffer. So you put all those together and it's a number that starts with an 8 and that's a little bit more clarity than I'd say we had a couple of years ago.","I don't think I can tell you today whether it's a low-8 or a high-8, but I think it starts with an 8. And then it depends on how the stress test change over time. I think we're getting more and more visibility into the CCAR process, the nature of those tests and the effect that those tests are going to have on the industry overall and on us. But having said all that, it's 9-somewhere today. So over the medium term, whatever the medium term is, I would be looking for a stability in the short term and a decline in the medium term toward some number that starts with an 8-somewhere.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets","You guys mentioned on the call about the margin coming down a bit due to a greater presence of the wholesale portfolio getting larger. What's causing the C&I loans in your average yield table where the yield in the C&I loans was down a fair amount? Is it just competition or what's causing the yield compression in the C&I loan portion of the loan book?","Bill Rogers","Well, overall, there're two points that you referenced, Gerard. One is that our overall portfolio mix is changing. You'll recall that going into the financial crisis, we were very much oriented toward residential mortgage, but perhaps overly concentrated in that product line. And over the last several years, we've been working hard to optimize the mix within our balance sheet, become more diversified.","One of the effects of becoming more diversified and reducing the sort of future risking as in volatility of our earnings is that as wholesale grows as a component of our overall mix, wholesale yields are a little bit lower than retail and consumer yields. But that's one of the things that's bringing margin down a little bit. The other thing is just the sheer amount of competition in the C&I space overall. And as overall margins decline in that space, that's affecting us too.","One thing you might want to look at that might help you is if you look for example that BBB bond spreads and look at how they've changed over time, you'll see that quarter-over-quarter, BBB bond spreads dropped 18 basis points Q1 to Q2. That's kind of the space in which a lot of regional banks play in when it comes to meeting corporate client needs. So that's one of the things that's affecting us.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","Can I go back and talk about the RPL to TDR sales? You said in the prepared remarks that you sold about $149 million. Did you take a loss on that? I can't find it in the documents. Did you take a loss or a gain on that sale?","Aleem Gillani","Maybe here is the way to think about that, Paul. We took a charge of $10 million on that sale. However we already had $16 million in reserves that were specifically identified to that portfolio. So the net effect of everything was actually a $6 million reduction in our provision expense for this quarter.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","You have about close to $2.6 billion of this stuff sitting on your balance sheet still, because right now we're hearing that the pricing for RPLs is very competitive. Is there plans to sell some more of that down?","Aleem Gillani","Well, we've got a pretty good experience this quarter. The net effect of that sale was $6 million reduction in our provision expense and an improvement in some of our credit agency and regulatory metrics. So pricing is good. We're set well. We've got a good experience. We don't have immediate plans to sell any more right now. But what we learned the last quarter I think was helpful as we think about our overall balance sheet profile as we look into next year.","Paul Miller - FBR Capital Markets","I know there's different prices for stuff that's been current for 24 months versus current for 12 months and stuff like that. I was just interested in what type of stuff you sold?","Bill Rogers","I'm sure Ankur and team would be happy to talk with you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Could you elaborate more on Robinson Humphrey? You said you had record investment banking fees. It looks like the revenues grew twice the pace of the five big banks. Just give some color on maybe the mix. You mentioned equities and mergers if you can mention the net income, ROE. It seems like it's over half of wholesale. So more disclosure would certainly be appreciated. And then lastly, you mentioned your capital ratio should start with an 8, whereas the largest investment banking players have capital ratios that start with at least a 9. So are you looking to maybe price more competitively?","Aleem Gillani","The 9 might work well for the large investment banks, sort of the Wall Street banks. That's really not us. We're a main street bank and the business that we do in our corporate investment banking set of businesses is really very much aimed at meeting client needs. So given the size of our business and given how vanilla it is relative to some of the more complex businesses that you might be used to covering, the overall capital ratio for us in the context of mix against the rest of our portfolio, the consumer business, the private wealth business, the mortgage businesswe think makes much more sense for us to be in the 8 level rather than the 9 level.","Bill Rogers","And then, Mike, I'll also talk about the fees side of the business. And as you know, this is an area that we've been investing in starting with the acquisition of the institutional business of Robinson Humphrey, but making sort of continued and steady investments in virtually all parts of that business. The bulk of that, let's call it, 60% to 70% would be in the syndication high-yield bond origination, investment-grade bond origination, tax exempt bond origination, so to think about as the traditional debt part of the business and that's just continued to track up sort of consistently every quarter rationalized for every quarter.","And then what we talk about is just more kick in on the M&A part of the business, more kick in on the equity part of the business. So instead of an eight-cylinder engine hitting on six cylinders hard, all eight cylinders are now starting to pump pretty aggressively. Relative to the others, I mean you sort of think about one of the big differences is think about the trading component. So our trading business is very issuer-driven and it was down about 6%. Others were down obviously multiples of that in the larger course. So that might explain a little bit of the difference.","And again, ours is just reflective of continued investment, continued slogging it out, adding good talent, high receptivity from our clients. I think they have been very receptive to a middle market investment banking business with capital.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And I assume this is what you mean when you say grow revenues per every dollar of expense to improve your efficiency ratio. I think I missed your guidance for 2015 or maybe you didn't give it. So 2015 efficiency ratio, it was 63.6% in the second quarter. Where do you think that will be in 2015?","Aleem Gillani","Mike, we haven't actually given guidance yet for 2015. We'll do so as we get closer around the end of the year.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Is it safe to assume that it would be below 64% since that's your target for 2014 or will the run-off of swap revenues push that back higher?","Aleem Gillani","Mike, we want to get better every year. We intend to become a more efficient company every year with a long-term target of below 60%. So directionally, it's safe to assume it will be down.","Operator","Our final question today is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.","Jason Harbes - Well Fargo","Actually it's Jason Harbes from Matt's team. So just want to follow-up on loan growth. I mean it looks like your loan growth was best-in-class this quarter, but you sounded a little bit less optimistic looking into the second half. Just kind of wondering is that a function of the transfer of the guaranteed mortgages or are you seeing any signs of softening across any of your markets?","Bill Rogers","Let me be clear. I didn't mean to be less optimistic. I just want to be careful about annualizing the quarter too many times. Based on what we see with pipelines, what we see from our clients, utilization rates are being slightly up. Our availability being up as well as growth being up, I don't have the reason to be other than optimistic about where we are from a loan growth standpoint.","Aleem Gillani","Jason, I appreciate you pointing out the $2 billion sale. Obviously that will affect our total loans. But as I said earlier, that $2 billion moves into securities and you expect the lower effect on the revenue to be immaterial.","Jason Harbes - Well Fargo","I guess my follow-up would be are you seeing any more or greater strength in the Florida market versus some of your other markets, any other noteworthy differences? I think in the past, Bill, you've talked about the Florida market being higher beta and the economy down there does seem to be outperforming. So just curious if you can give us any update there.","Bill Rogers","I'd say universally, we feel better about what's going on in the Florida market. Housing is certainly stronger virtually across every market and some markets very, very good. Our commercial activity in Florida is also good. Some of our top performing commercial units are in Florida. Our consumer business, like I've said before, never really had the fall-off, but it continues to be sort of consistent with the rest of the company. All the data we see on Florida and the time I spent there is positive. Tourism industry is sort of going gang busters. Net in migration back in to the state at a pretty high clip. Very good business environment, you've seen some corporate headquarters move to Florida. So I think we're actually seeing the other side of that beta right now.","Ankur Vyas","All right.

In typical fashion, I will begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter and then turn it over to Aleem for details on the results. I'll then spend some time reviewing our performance at the business segment level.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.73 on net income to common of $393 million. This represents a 16% increase from the first quarter of last year. We had solid performance in several areas including strong loan growth, effective expense management, and further improved asset quality.","Revenue was seasonally lower relative to prior quarter and down versus the prior year due to the marked decline in mortgage refinance activity that began last summer.","Looking at the component parts, net interest income and margin were down slightly relative to the fourth quarter and non-interest income was seasonally lower.","A more telling story I think emerges when you look at the year-over-year results. We generated solid growth across most of our non-interest income categories, notably in investment banking and wealth management, where we've made incremental investments to help drive growth. The exception is the decline in refinance activity which impacted our mortgage production income.","Expenses were relatively stable to the fourth quarter with reductions in most categories offsetting the seasonal increase in personnel expense. This was the combined result of our concerted effort toward driving efficiency improvements as well as further contraction in our cyclical costs.","Average performing loans increased 2% sequentially driven by targeted growth within our C&I, commercial real estate and consumer portfolios. Average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter with the favorable mix shift continuing.","Credit quality continues to improve; non-performing loans were down 5% from the prior quarter and 37% from last year; the net charge-off ratio declined five basis points from the prior quarter to 35 basis points. Lastly, our capital position remains solid with Tier-1 common estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel I basis and 9.7% for Basel III.","As you're aware, the capital plan we submitted as part of this year's CCAR process was not objected to by the Federal Reserve. This included increasing the return of capital to our shareholders in the form of a higher quarterly stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20 per share and the repurchase of up to $450 million worth of our stock during the upcoming four quarters. We're obviously pleased that our capital position and improved earnings enabled these actions.","We generated solid momentum in our businesses, but some of it is masked by broader industry headwinds including the persistently low rate environment and a rapid decline in home refinance activity.","However, our markets are exhibiting favorable macroeconomic trends and housing continues to improve. Furthermore, we're continuing to make targeted investments in our businesses to drive growth as we move beyond the challenging revenue environment.","So, let me turn it over to Aleem.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share this quarter were $0.73, which was 16% higher than EPS in the prior year and $0.04 lower compared to the prior quarter.","The sequential quarter decrease was driven by lower revenue primarily due to the lower day count negatively impact net interest income and the normal non-interest income seasonality given lower transaction volumes in certain fee categories in the first quarter.","The year-over-year 16% increase was driven by reductions in provision and credit-related expenses, which were partially offset by a significant drop in mortgage production income. In addition, the lower effective tax rate this quarter, which was favorably impacted by certain discrete items, also contributed to the year-over-year EPS increase.","Let's review the underlying trends in more detail starting on slide five. Both net interest income and the net interest margin declined slightly compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin was down one basis point due to continued loan yield compression. And net interest income declined $8 million primarily as a consequence of having two fewer days in the first quarter.","Compared to the first quarter of 2013, net interest income and net interest margin were both negatively impacted by declining loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income, partially offset by higher securities yields and lower deposit costs. In addition, net interest income benefited from the 7% average performing loan growth experienced over the past year.","Looking forward, we would expect the net interest margin to decline further throughout 2014, primarily due to compression in loan yields and lower commercial loan swap income. We continue to expect full year 2014 net interest margin to decline compared to 2013 albeit at a modestly slower pace than the 2013 versus 2012 decline.","You will recall that as our commercial loan swaps mature, we become more asset sensitive, which is a conscious design of our balance sheet management strategy over the medium term.","Moving on to slide six, adjusted non-interest income was lower by $18 million, primarily driven by normal seasonal fee income trends between the fourth and first quarter. Service charges for deposits declined $10 million sequentially, primarily due to seasonality and fewer business days in the first quarter, as well as lower incidence rates.","Investment banking income had a strong quarter though revenues were down modestly from the high level of deal activity that occurred in the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2013, investment banking revenues were up $20 million due to growth across a number of product areas. Trading income was down $8 million sequentially, though entirely driven by a $13 million increase in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt.","Excluding the impact of fair value items, core trading income was essentially flat. Mortgage servicing income increased $16 million relative to the prior quarter, due to lower decay in the MSR asset, which was the result of lower refinance activity and positive net hedge performance.","Mortgage production income increased $12 million sequentially due to a lower mortgage repurchase provision and higher fair value gains, which were partially offset by lower origination fees. Gain on sale was generally stable as slightly higher margins offset slightly lower LOC volume.","Retail investment services continued its positive trend, resulting from our ongoing focus on meeting more clients' wealth and investment needs. However, other non-interest income declined $17 million sequentially as a result of gains realized on certain asset sales in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Compared to the first quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income fell $86 million, primarily due to lower mortgage production income which resulted from both lower gain on sale margins and lower production volume.","Excluding mortgage production income we had solid year-over-year growth in noninterest income due to increases in investment banking, wealth management and mortgage servicing.","Let's move to expenses on slide seven. Reported non-interest expense was generally stable compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Personnel expense increased $77 million sequentially, primarily driven by the anticipated seasonal increase in benefits expense and FICA-related costs.","Cyclical costs improved, both sequentially and compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower expenses associated with legacy mortgage and legal matters, and continued improvements in the overall asset quality of our loan portfolio.","We would not anticipate further improvements in cyclical costs for first quarter levels, particularly given the current low levels of OREO and credit services cost. Other expense categories generally experienced modest reductions when compared to the prior quarter.","We incurred a $36 million charge this quarter related to the impairment of certain legacy affordable housing assets. This charge has no impact to our core affordable housing and community development business, which continues to grow and invest within the communities we serve.","In addition, this quarter, we adopted new accounting guidance, ASU 2014-01 that resulted in the amortization of certain affordable housing investments moving from the non-interest expense line to the tax line. This adoption has no impact to bottom line net income or earnings per share, and prior periods have been restated accordingly.","As you can see on slide eight, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved slightly relative to the fourth quarter as the reduction in adjusted expenses more than offset the modest revenue decline.","We continue to target an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of less than 64% for 2014, and this quarter's performance is supportive of that goal. Our long term efficiency ratio target continues to be below 60%.","Turning to credit quality on slide nine. Asset quality continued to improve this quarter with the net charge-off ratio declining from 40 basis points to 35 basis points. Non-performing loans were also lower, improving by 5% sequentially and 37% year-over-year. Both the declines in net charge-offs and non-performing loans were driven by improvements in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolio.","The improvement in asset quality also drove slight declines in the allowance and the allowance for loan and lease loss ratio. The loan loss provision was generally stable, as improvements in asset quality were offset by loan growth in the quarter.","Going forward, we would expect continued, but modest improvements in non-performing loans, primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We also would expect net charge-offs in the residential portfolio to drift modestly lower in the near-term. However, commercial and consumer net charge-offs are already at or below normal levels.","In addition, as we have experienced in the past two quarters, positive loan growth may offset future asset quality improvement and does impact sequential changes in the loan-loss provision.","Turning to balance sheet trends on slide 10. Average performing loans increased by $2.9 billion or about 2%. Growth was broad-based across most portfolios, but principally driven by C&I, CRE and Consumer. C&I loan growth was driven by the commercial auto dealer growth, the corporate banking expansion initiatives we began last year and broad-based growth across most CIB industry verticals. Average CRE loans were up 11% sequentially due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and the portfolio acquisition.","Lastly, average consumer loans were also up modestly, given growth in our indirect auto, credit card and LightStream businesses, which were partially offset by a slight decline in our home equity portfolio.","Relative to the prior year, average performing loans increased $8.2 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. We're doing our part to support our clients and grow the economy.","Overall, loan growth was solid this quarter as we continue to execute across targeted growth initiatives and the economic indicators in our markets continue to improve.","Turning to deposit performance. Average client deposits were up 1% compared to the prior quarter and the first quarter of 2013, as growth in low-cost deposits was partially offset by a lower amount of high cost time deposits. This continued favorable shift in deposit mix helped move interest-bearing deposit costs down by one and six basis points respectively, compared to the prior quarter and prior year.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Tier 1 common equity expanded by approximately $300 million as a result of growth in retained earnings. Our key capital ratios increased slightly as the growth in retained earnings more than offset our loan growth.","In addition, tangible book value per share increased 3% from the prior quarter, also due to growth in retained earnings.","As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2014 CCAR process. Capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $450 million over the coming year and increases our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.20, subject to Board approval.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. The core operating momentum generated in each of our business segments helped drive the overall solid corporate results we discussed this morning. I'll start with consumer banking and private wealth management business, where net income was up 14% over last year. Strong retail investment income growth more than offset decline from service charges.","In addition, provision for credit losses decreased meaningfully as credit quality improved, driven by home equity given the improved housing market. Further, consumer loan production was up 17% over last year, which helped offset legacy asset runoff.","We made a lot of progress in this business over the last several quarters. We've significantly increased our investment in digital to meet our client needs, and this has helped us to create a more efficient branch network and staffing model.","Going forward, you can expect continued rationalization with additional net reductions in our branch network; however, at a slower rate than what we accomplished over the past couple of years, particularly given the importance of a branch and client acquisition and account opening.","We're also making investments to grow revenue in this business. For example, we've made investments most notably in talent in our wealth management related businesses to help us meet more of our client needs, wealth and investment needs.","We've seen good early returns here with wealth management related non-interest income in this segment up 10% year-over-year. Low interest rates and consumer fee environment continue to place challenges on revenue growth; however, we feel good about the long-term overall momentum we're generating in this business.","Now, let's take our closer look at a wholesale. Our wholesale business is affected by seasonality when comparing the current quarter to the fourth, specifically, our investment banking business. The strong operating trends are evident when you look at results compared to last year.","Pre-tax income excluding the $36 million affordable housing impairment was up 10% year-over-year. Non-interest income grew 5% over the prior year, primarily driven by investment banking wherein we had strong growth in our syndications, M&A advisory and equity related businesses.","Net interest income increased 4% due to robust loan and deposit growth. Now this growth was partially offset by continuing declines in loan yields.","The pace of wholesale loan growth continued as average loans grew $2.6 billion or 5% from last quarter. Loan growth was broad-based led by further growth in CRE and our commercial dealer group along with our large corporate lending areas, most notably our energy and financial technology verticals.","Overall, our pipelines continue to be healthy giving us confidence on wholesale loan growth prospects in 2014. Competition, however, remains high, which may lead to ongoing pricing pressure for us and the industry.","We continue to make investments in the business to better meet an array of our clients' needs and augment our capabilities. A recent example is our acquisition of an advisory company to the energy business, where we will now be able to complement our existing corporate finance capabilities with their underlying assets expertise.","Looking at the remainder of 2014, we are optimistic about the prospects of our Wholesale business, as we improved share and better leverage the full platform of our product capabilities for more of our client base.","Now, let's take a look at mortgage. In October of last year, we outlined our intent to reduce core expenses by approximately $50 million a quarter or 20% by the second quarter of this year. We're pleased to report that we've achieved this objective one quarter early and doing so help drive the bottom line performance of our Mortgage business into the black.","Taking a closer look at revenue, non-interest income was up sequentially with both servicing income and production income expanding. Origination volume was down, but that was offset by a lower mortgage repurchase provision, our fair value gains and increased servicing income.","All-in, gain on sale margins were generally stable compared to prior quarter. And as I said on the expense side, we were successful on our cost-saving efforts and that along with lower cyclical cost drove a 27% sequential decline in expenses.","Provision declines continued given the ongoing improvement in the credit quality of the residential mortgage portfolio, which also helped drive improved performance in this business.","Returning the Mortgage segment to profitability was a step in the right direction, but we know we have more to do to generate sustained profitability. On a near term basis, we anticipate an increase in production volume as we enter the spring\/summer selling season, and inventory in some of our markets is tight and that could delay some of the recovery.","So, net-net, we are positive about the direction we are taking our businesses and their ability to generate profitable growth, particularly as the operating environment for the industry improves and we are able to more fully realize the returns on the targeted investments that we've been making.","So, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you to begin the Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Great. Thanks, Bill. Jane, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator instructions)","Our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Hey, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Morning, Ryan.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","When I think about the expense base, it clearly came in better than I think a lot of us would have expected. So, when we look out, how much of the $77 million of the incentive comp was seasonal, i.e. how much that to you expect to leave the run rate in 2Q?","As you think about just the trajectory of the expense base over the remainder of the year, I know you guys are doing 1.5 billion review with the back office, do you think expenses should continue to trend lower? Should we see a downward bias from here?","Aleem Gillani","Ryan, it's Aleem. Why don't I start that off with the first piece? The $77 million increase wasn't all the incentive comp, that was total comp. And the majority of that, when you look at salaries, salaries were the same quarter-over-quarter. A good portion of that actually resulted from employee benefits.","For example, our FICA taxes went up by $35 million this quarter and that's typically just a Q1 event, and rolls back after that. So I would expect a good portion of that $77 million to roll back into the bottom line starting in Q2.","However, when we think about our total performance, we actually don't think about dollar expenses alone, we think about them in the context of our overall efficiency ratio. And if we do get revenue growth, I wouldn't be surprised to see some expense increase come along with our revenue growth.","But as you know, we are focused very much on that efficiency ratio. Our adjusted number, as you saw, was 64.9% in the first quarter. For us to get to our target of under 64% this year, we are going to have to continue to fight to bring that down. So in the context of our overall efficiency, I would think about our expenses declining as a percentage of revenue for the remainder of the year.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And just in terms of getting to below the 64%, as you think about the components of that, will more of that need to come from the revenue side relative to the expense from here? I guess, related to that Bill, I know it is still early days in terms of thinking out to next year.","But clearly, there is a big falloff from the commercial loan swap income as we think into next year. Can we continue to see efficiency improvement in light of the revenue headwind that you'll have next year?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Yeah, let me sort of start with this year, maybe sort of embellish a little bit on what Aleem was saying is and focus again continuing to be on that efficiency ratio and the components of revenue expense. I think we outlined sort of in each of our business, as you probably have a little bit of a different focus.","Now, for example, in Wholesale, we're just trying to generalize, you know, about three quarters of our focus is on revenue and about a quarter is on the expense side, and mortgage would sort of be the counter opposite of that and the consumer and private wealth would sort of be more equally balanced.","So, in each of our businesses and everything that we're doing, we're trying to reach that right balance of making the investments, recognizing that revenues going to have to be a bigger part of this going forward, but also recognizing that we still have some expense opportunities. And you see that manifest itself, for example, in the Mortgage side of this quarter.","Looking out to next year, what I would say is, we're not backing off our guidance to getting to below 60% efficiency ratio. That will obviously be dictated by time, but I am very confident that we'll have an environment that we can achieve that.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Good morning.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Hi, Matt.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Just following up on the revenue question, as we think about net interest income dollars from here, should we expect them to grow? I know you mentioned the NIM will continue to be under pressure, but what about the net interest income dollars?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think we've been able to show a little bit of that over the last couple of quarters, Matt, as our net interest income dollars have been sort of generally stable despite a declining NIM overall.","So, we've been able to get some good loan growth over the last few quarters. We're seeing slightly improved confidence amongst our clients. We're able to do more client business over the last few quarters.","So if that continues and we continue to get that loan growth, then yes, I am looking to see net interest income dollars start to grow with loan growth more than offsetting the effect of declining NIM.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","And, Matt, right now as it relates to sort of a future loan growth, I mean, your crystal ball is short by nature, but our pipelines continue to be healthy, I mean they are up 10% of where they were last year. Our unfunded availability is up by more than that. So, some of the leading indicators as it relates to loan growth continue to be good.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then just separately as we think about the cyclical costs or the environmental expenses, you said they wouldn't come down from this level, but obviously the roughly $170 million annualizes well below your $325 million target? Can we stay relatively close to these levels or how should we think about the trajectory of those environmental costs?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think overall when you look at the composition of these costs, some of these costs are made up of things like their credit services and OREO. Credit services is down because mortgage production is down. That's the biggest component of that piece.","So that will follow where mortgage production goes. OREO overall is down about as low as it can be. I think it was pretty close to zero for the year last year. So, over time, you would expect that that's going to drift up a little bit, but collection services will probably drift down a little bit.","So, when I look at the composition of that number, and you are right, we had additional -- we had guided some time ago to a number that would be below $325 million annualized, we're now about half of that number on an annualized basis. I don't see it going much lower than here, Matt.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. But it sounds like ex-higher mortgage production, which should lead to higher revenue if that occurs, if we take out the credit services piece, the other two might net itself out?","Aleem Gillani","Those two components I think will net themselves out. There is the fourth component to that piece, of course, which is operating losses and operating losses are lumpy and somewhat out of our control. So, excluding those exogenous shocks, I think then your premise is correct.","Matthew O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That was helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Thanks. Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Guys, I want to just follow-up on the path of net interest income and asset sensitivity to your points about -- obviously we know about this step down next year. So, can you talk us through, first of all, as we get through next year, does the path continue to run down through the year on the slide you show the average?","And then how do we know when you are at that point where you are comfortable with the magnitude of how asset sensitive the balance sheet ends up post that runoff?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think our comfort with our level of asset sensitivity, ken, will depend a little bit on the interest rate environment or primarily on the interest rate environment at that time. We had set up a structure for asset sensitivity that allowed us to become more asset sensitive as we thought that time was going to be right for the economy to start to grow once again.","Looking at that general structure, I still think we sort of generally have that right and we are becoming more asset sensitive just about the right time when most people expect rates are going to start to go up.","So, we'll adjust that over time as we have continued to do, but as we adjust it and we'll be adjusting it based on what we think the economy looks like and the path of rates looks like at that time. Does that make sense?","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Yeah. And then to the second question, just about your goal that you would set out for next year and Bill to your point earlier about potentially reaching 60% efficiency ratio next year. Again, just to elaborate if you could just about the balance of needing to see revenue growth versus needing to see cost reduction in terms of you are seeing out that far out, what gives you the confidence? What pieces give you the confidence that you can see unfolding?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","I want to make sure that I didn't say 60% next year. So that's our long-term goal and my confidence still remains that we've got right plans in place and infrastructure and management focus and business and environment that we can get there. But the length of time and when we get there is going to be economic dependent and somewhat interest rate dependent.","As I have said before, we're highlighting the focus in each of our businesses related to sort of overall expense focus and overall revenue focus and it's just got to continue to be a balance. And hopefully, we have articulated the fact that we've got a lot of intensity and investment on the revenue side and we have got good momentum on there. But very similarly continued focus on the expense side and, again, hopefully highlighted by this quarter.","When we started this endeavor on the expense side, our quarterly expense run rate was about $1 billion -- a little over $1.5 billion, and now we are sort of hovering at a number that's a little bit below $1.4 billion. So we are getting sort of a permanent structure and I would expect that net of revenue investments that will continue to track down.","Kenneth Usdin - Jefferies","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get a little more detail in terms of your thinking about future commercial real estate growth that was as you mentioned augmented little bit by an acquisition in the quarter, but even excluding that it looked relatively strong.","Just trying to get a better sense as to where you're seeing strength and potentially what markets or what products might be areas that you think are getting a little overheated?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Yes, I mean the good news is that it's pretty broad-based. So that's a good news and we had a chance to really think through our commercial real estate strategy going forward, the focus was to have a very diversified portfolio not only from a product set, but also from a geographic set. So that was -- that's what we said out and we're seeing that.","So while we've seen some office expansion as an example, that's one of the opportunities that's been in larger cities with sort of good underlying prospects, we've seen growth in the REIT side, we've seen growth in the institutional side and we're starting to see, within our own markets, which is positive. We're starting to see some of that recovery in virtually all categories multifamily, industrial, little less office, retail, clearly, on the bottom of that food group in terms of recovery. So it's pretty broad-based.","In terms of what's soft, we look at that from a, let's call it, a heat-map perspective. So while we may be investing in multifamily in some of our markets, and other of our markets, we wouldn't be. Office sort of very similar, industrial very similar, and as I mentioned earlier, probably the one that's lagging probably more universally is retail and we'll be cautious about that coming out of the cycle.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Sure. Understood. Then Aleem, I guess, a question for you on the mortgage expenses. Obviously, you met your $50 million cost reduction target a bit early, but if I look at the numbers in terms of the Mortgage business unit, it looks like core expenses there were down about 21% quarter-over-quarter.","Sorry, costs were down 27%. Originations were down little over 20%. But on a year-over-year basis, originations were down about 65% with costs down 30%. I guess my point is or my question is, are there further opportunities for rightsizing the fixed cost in that business? Or do you think you are pretty much where you need to be?","Aleem Gillani","That's a good question, Matt, thank you. We've actually, I think, taken -- obviously the variable costs have been coming out over time with a little bit of a lag, and you've been seeing that. As you know, we've been working hard to take fixed costs out of the system also. We've taken a lot of those out, but I think we still have some additional opportunities to take out fixed costs out of the system.","Although from here at this level, obviously, there is less opportunity for us to take more out. We do have some plans. We do have some other things that we're working on, and over the course of the remainder of this year, we'll be trying to take out fixed cost little by little out of that system.","Matthew Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Murray with ISI. Your line is open.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thank you. Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Keith Murray - ISI","Just ask you a hypothetical. If -- let's say for argument sake, revenue stayed flat sequentially next quarter, could the expense run rate go below $1.3 billion?","Aleem Gillani","Well, that's a tough question. We've been thinking about our expense rate, Keith, in the context of a number that starts with a $1.3 billion, somewhere between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. As Bill said a minute ago, if you look at 2011, 2012, we are running about $1.550 billion, we are now about $1.350 billion.","So we've taken $200 million a quarter out of our run rate and we think we've taken about as much out as we can, that's not to say we can't find individual opportunities from here and we are going to be continuing to do that. I would be thinking about if revenues stay exactly where they are that our expense base would still start with a $1.3 billion. Now perhaps it would be lower in that range, but it would start with a $1.3 billion.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Remember, maybe sort of -- you gave a quarter hypothetical, I mean remember we are sort of in a seasonally low as it relates to a lot of our businesses. So, remember investment banking for the first quarter was seasonally low, so we'd expect that to be better in the second quarter.","Mortgage clearly is seasonally low, we'd expect the spring season to sort of get up and going and expect some increases there. And then low day count on the Consumer side which won't be the same thing in the quarter.","But I would say sort of broadly and the reason we are talking so much about the efficiency ratio and if we see revenues staying flat for a really, really long period of time then we are going to continue to drive down on the expense side. I mean we're just would not throwing in the towel on this long-term objective in our business model of getting to sub-60% efficiency ratio.","Keith Murray - ISI","Fair enough. And then, it looks like your fees to average loan service for others jumped a bit this quarter. Just curious what drove that and how high can that fee go?","Aleem Gillani","Fees, you mean in the mortgage side?","Keith Murray - ISI","In the mortgage business, yeah, it looked like you went to 21 bps from 14 bps.","Aleem Gillani","I wouldn't expect that to go much higher from here.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And good morning everyone.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Just had a follow-up question around the strong commercial real estate loan growth you've been generating. And I wanted to take a step back and think about what type of ROEs you are generating now really relative to the peak of 2009, 2010, also to the value of sort of pre-crisis 2007. How do you think about that? And maybe even comment on differences in funding costs, NIE and credit cost expectations?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Craig, let me start that off. Overall, when I think about our ROEs and -- well, perhaps I should start with ROAs in that business. ROAs overall I think are a little bit lower than we would like them to be now. And that's a function of all of the liquidity and all of the competition that exists for that business.","And when I talk about ROAs, I'm talking about that in the context of just the loan -- just on balance sheet business. What we're trying to do is supplement ROEs overall by doing other business with those clients and trying to make those relationships not just lending relationships, but doing some of the other business that they need and having SunTrust become one of their financial services suppliers across a broad variety of products.","So, I think we're starting out in that business as we are growing, with lower ROAs than I would like from pure lending. But we're working to supplement the overall ROEs with additional business.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","And maybe if you sort of drew a comparison to the past of that is we didn't have a capital markets capability in CRE in the past. So, I like to think about this business as basically thinking about it like an industry vertical within our corporate investment banking businesses.","And we have a lot of investment that we have made on both the debt and equity side in addition to investments we have made on the treasury management side. So, our ability to generate ROA and ROE in addition to the loan product, we just have the capability now that we just didn't have before. So, it's sort of a fundamentally different business.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And just a follow-up here. With your portfolio loan yield now in the Siri book of 2.93%, I'm just wondering what was the loan yield on the new business generated in the first quarter. And if you have any commentary around LTVs or terms, that would be helpful too.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Well, I think when we look at loan yields overall, we sort of segregate that business-by-business. So, when you are looking at the wholesale business, in the wholesale business new loans that were coming on within CIB and up at sort of the top end of our client base are coming on with a two handle. And then down into the commercial and business banking space, those loans that are coming on are coming on now with a 3 handle.","And then if you look at the LTVs to the portfolios where that's most relevant, sort of the consumer portfolio and the commercial real estate portfolio, when you think about them, on the consumer side, I mean, the credit quality continues to be really good. The LTVs are pretty consistently positive, so we haven't seen significant really any deterioration on the consumer side.","And then on the commercial real estate side, Aleem's comment was right, I mean we're frustrated by some of the pricing that's out there, but the structure stayed okay. And similarly, we haven't seen sort of massive change in LTV in that portfolio.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","All right, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks very much. So, a quick follow-up on the LTVs for CRE is up. Should we assume you're running at about like 65% to 70%?","Thomas E. Freeman","It depends on the -- its Tom Freeman, it depends on the individual products set. In the institutional area, I think it's better than that. In the individual project finance, probably in the 70% range is about right in construction loan probably a little higher than that.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And better means like lower, right?","Thomas E. Freeman","It does to me.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","I just want to make sure. Okay. And then just my other question was on the LCR, we've heard from a couple of other institutions this quarter around what they are kind of triangulating to and how long it's going to take to get there?","Just wondering if you can give us a sense to where you are today and what kind of cushion you think you need to run with and how long it takes to get there. And does it have any indication for NIM or asset sensitivity as you transition towards where you need to be?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I wish I knew exactly where we did need to be, we are waiting on those final rules. But we're moving now. We're already transitioning rather than waiting for the final rules to come out. We'll have -- we'll be above where we need to be by year end. I'd say, we're not quite today where we need to be, but by the time the rules come out and by the time they become effective December 31 this year, we'll be running at above 80%.","We're determining what kind of cushion we need to have and that probably we'll need to be running at about a 10% cushion above that number. So I wouldn't be surprised to see us and the industry have some kind of cushion, and I would be thinking about that in the context of 10% or so soon after year-end.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Where ever you are today relative to the 80% to 90% that you are expecting to be at is embedded in the NIM guidance that you gave us and the asset sensitivity?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Yes, it is.","Aleem Gillani","It's embedded in NIM guidance and in NII guidance. There is going to be a NIM cost, there will be an NII cost to do this, but we've incorporated that within the guidance we've already given.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. You may ask your question.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Good morning.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Morning.","Aleem Gillani","Morning Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Just trying to figure out which trend I should be extrapolating here, if I look at the quarter-over-quarter trend, fourth quarter to first quarter, the efficiency ratio improved from 66% to 65%, you got the mortgage savings, the efficiency improved even while absorbing the seasonal comp increase, you beat consensus, that all looks good.","If I look at the year-over-year trends, it doesn't look so good and that's where the -- it looks like the efficiency ratio got worse in aggregate, and in wholesale and consumer the comp ratio went higher, revenues to employee went lower. So which trend is more important, the quarterly trend or the year-over-year trend?","And what gives you confidence that you'll meet your efficiency target of 64% or less this year when it was higher in the first quarter than that? And maybe if you could just give us some detail, how much fixed cost savings do you have left and give us any ballpark, how much you investing for revenue growth? Any other concrete ins and outs would be helpful.","Aleem Gillani","Mike, I think that was about seven questions, but let me see if I can take a crack at that. I think you've done well in describing a complex business. We're a good-sized company, it's a complex business in a complex area and trying to extrapolate out of a single quarter or even a single year may not give you a really good indication of where the company is headed if you try and do a straight line extrapolation.","But maybe you think about it in this context, if you are thinking about the efficiency ratio, where are we headed and how can we get there. Over the last couple of years, as we've said earlier, we've been very focused on expense management.","Taking $200 million of quarter out of our expense base clearly has been sort of the right thing to do and it has moved us toward this path of improved efficiency overall. From here where we need to get to is perhaps a more balanced approach, and as we think about the remainder of the year and into next year, we'll continue to focus on expense cuts.","We do have some additional fixed cost that we're looking at now and that I think we'll be able to take out of the system over the course of the next year or two. But that alone isn't going to be enough.","We are also focused on revenue growth and revenue growth across a wide variety of businesses. We're looking at revenue growth in our consumer and private wealth business and we've got several initiatives there.","Bill has talked some about the revenue growth that we're expecting in our wholesale business and with the overall improvement in the economy and stabilization in housing prices, perhaps we're going to be able to start to see some more revenue growth from here in the purchase market in mortgage rather than relying as much as we have in the past on the refund market.","So with all of those things coming into place, we do think that for the rest of this year, we are going to continue to be able to improve our efficiency ratio and keep grinding that down to hit our target for this year.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Yeah Mike, Bill. Maybe the easiest way to say it is this quarter's efficiency ratio was ahead of where we thought we would be internally on our path to 64%, so maybe sort of given all the puts and takes that we know and that we put in into that forecast. We talked a little bit about Wholesale Banking and some of the investments that we're making and some of the revenue per FTE.","As you well know, we're continuing to invest in that business. We feel good about it. Part of that revenue to FTE, our expansion has to do with some of the expansion we're doing in our national Corporate Banking expansion with offices in Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco.","And as you know, that takes a while to build up and you've got the investment ahead of that, but similar to what I said about the efficiency ratio, it's also ahead of where we thought we'd be. So we're seeing a good progress there.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Then just one follow-up. I heard during the call saying that some of the improvement is economic dependent, interest rate dependent, macro dependent. So even though you're ahead of where you thought you'd be in Wholesale and the efficiency overall, if the economy or interest rates, the macro environment doesn't pan out as you expect now, do you still think you can get below the 64% ratio?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Yeah, I think just on the short-term basis on the 64%, I mean we're not projecting massive increase in rates, GDP jumping to 5% or whatever. We're assuming that that's the environment that we're in. That we're in a 2% to 3% GDP.","We're in a low rate environment and we don't see a material short-term change. Most of those comments I think related to the overall long-term goal of getting to 60%. I think that's where it's a bit more macro dependent, whereas this year is a bit more micro dependent.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marty Mosby with Guggenheim. You may ask your question.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Good morning. First question just in response to what we're talking about inefficiency ratio you showed on that page. I don't think the first quarter of '13 was adjusted for the positive accrual you had in incentives last year. You did take out the affordable housing in this quarter of this year, but I don't think the expense that you had a benefit from in last year was adjusted in that lower efficiency ratio?","Aleem Gillani","Marty, you are 100% correct. You are exactly right, and you see that on the efficiency ratio page, you also see that later when you look at the Wholesale Bank page and the expense base there where that number was adjusted down one-time at the first quarter of '13. You are 100% correct. Thank you.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","So, I think when you adjust that then you would see the efficiency improving year-over-year as well as sequentially?","Aleem Gillani","That's the -- just the Bill's comments that when we look at Q1 this year, we feel pretty good, we're I think slightly ahead of our plan for the year and we think we're on a really good trajectory for the remainder of this year to achieve our target.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Other thing Aleem, if you can just take couple of minutes, the swap income reduction is a big issue for everybody kind of thinking into next year. I just thought, if we could compartmentalize that a little bit better, so if you say we're going to lose $67 million going for $102 million down to $35 million, just for mathematic and just kind of thought process, what if you replaced those swaps today. How much of the $67 million could you actually replace at the current rate today, at current market?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Marty, I probably wouldn't want to replace those swaps with other swaps, because the whole plan of swaps is actually designed to make us more asset sensitive in the future, which is exactly where we'd like to be.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Right. I'm not saying you'd want to actually do that. I was just trying to compartmentalize the $67 million into two pieces. One is one that it's really related to you becoming more asset sensitive, well that's a decision that you give out, because you are making that decision.","And then the second part is, how much more asset sensitive are you becoming, giving up that $67 million or 100 basis points. So we give up this, we are getting this, that's what I'm trying to build that trade off.","Aleem Gillani","Okay, right. So, if you think -- let's think about it this way. We ended the quarter with asset sensitivity rate of about 2.3%, so if we get a 100 basis point increase in rates now, 2.3% of sort of $5 billion odd in net interest income per year will get us about $115 million a year back. And then as the swaps roll off, as we become more asset sensitive, then you to think about that in context of every billion dollars that rolls off in the swaps.","If you go back and look at our K, we've shown you what the roll off schedule looks like for swaps over the next couple of years. Every billion dollars gets us about 0.2% more asset sensitive. So, by the time we get to 2015 and 2016, all things being equal, you could see a path where we are twice as asset sensitive than as we are today.","Marty - Guggenheim","So, in that sense, you'd be giving up out $67 million to benefit by, let's say, $120 million, about twice -- almost twice as much?","Aleem Gillani","Something like that.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","Yeah, if we get to 100 basis point parallel increase.","Ankur Vyas ","We have time for one more question. Jane?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Morning, John.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.","Just on the granularity a little bit here on the expenses. The other expenses were particularly low in the quarter, even adjusting for the low income housing credit adjustment, and also, the processing itself were significantly lower than we had thought. So I just want to see if you can give us an idea of the run rate to expect in those areas.","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think we're looking at sort of general an overall run rate across the board. One of the reasons expenses might be down in one area is we've got an increase in another area. So, rather than focusing on the line by line issue, John, if you think about the total number from here on to the rest of the year, I do think that we are in generally the right band for expenses. And I would expect that if we don't get revenue increases, we'd see the overall expense base stay around this level, sort of low 1.3%.","But as Bill said a few minutes ago, we are looking to get some revenue growth between now and the end of the year. And our challenge and what we are going to be working on doing for the remainder of the year is taking that revenue growth in, but still managing the expense base tightly in order to keep the efficiency ratio still moving downward.","Bill Rogers, Jr.","And there is just a lot of good efficiency things within that other expense category. And it will fluctuate up and down, but core we are more -- we are doing things more efficiently that show up there.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. So given that and given your comments that you're tracking ahead of your 64% target at this point, no -- is there no decision at this point to potentially lower that target?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think for '14 we have set the target. And -- let's be clear, it's not an easy target. This is we are working hard to get there. We are going to continue to work hard to get there this year, but that's a target for this year. And once we achieve it, we are going to be setting ourselves a higher bar for next year and you already know what our medium term target is, which is substantially more difficult than where we are now.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. Great. And then lastly just one other thing on the swap income, I know you just gave good color about that you probably wouldn't replace the additional swaps. But any other activities either in the bond book or elsewhere outside of natural asset sensitivity that you could do to offset or to replace that foregone income?","Bill Rogers, Jr.","Well, we have been taking actions. In the first quarter we did take some actions in our on balance sheet portfolio, and we also did take some actions actually in the swap book in our off balance sheet portfolio. If you look at the total of those books now we're running at about an overall duration between those books at a little bit over three years.","And I feel actually feel pretty comfortable with that kind of a number, I wouldn't want to be extending that out much more from here, thinking about where rates are very likely to go over the next couple of years.","So our overall focus to grow income is going to be less in the on and off balance sheet securities portfolios and it's going to be much more in doing client business and growing both low and fee income with clients.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","All right. Jane, this concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining us today.

In addition to today\u2019s press release, we\u2019ve also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our Executive Management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

I\u2019m going to begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Aleem for some additional details including our results at the business segment level. I\u2019ll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter\u2019s performance fits into our long-term strategy and overall investment thesis.","To start I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. For several years we've been on a path to grow and diversify the business, improved profitability and increase our capital return to shareholders. This quarter you saw our continued progress in each of these areas. Specifically our ongoing commitment to invest in revenue growth opportunities while also tightly managing expenses resulted in solid improvements and efficiency.","Additionally, as most of you are aware, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2016 capital plan which calls for a 23% increase in total capital return relative to our 2015 plan. This is a result of our strong capital position and improved financial performance and demonstrates our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders.","Now getting into the specifics, we reported $0.94 of earnings per share this quarter which included certain discrete items that netted to a $0.05 benefit to the bottom line, but which did not meaningfully impact the current quarter's efficiency ratio. Aleem will provide some more detail on these items later, but thematically, they help better position our Company for the future, particularly as it relates to optimizing our branch delivery network.","Excluding these items and the $0.03 of discrete tax benefits from a year ago EPS increased 3% a solid performance, particularly given the $120 million year-over-year increase in loan loss provision. This performance was supported by a strong revenue growth as total revenues grew 6% sequentially, and 7% year-over-year.","The sequential improvement was driven by higher non-interest income and the year-over-year improvement was driven largely by increased net interest income reflecting the diversity of our business model. This revenue growth combined with tightly controlled expenses resulted in a 60.1% tangible efficiency ratio this quarter, a meaningful improvement compared to both prior quarter and prior year.","Net interest income was up slightly compared to the first quarter, as solid loan growth offset for five basis point decline in NIM. Non-interest income was up nearly a $120 million sequentially reflecting the strong execution in both favorable and volatile markets by our mortgage and investment banking teams.","Average loan and deposit growth this quarter was 2% and 3% respectively driven by solid economic conditions in our markets combined with the onboard investments we've made and continue to make in our businesses. As anticipated we continue to resolve problem energy credits, which drove the 14 basis point sequential increase in net charge-offs and the three basis point decline in the NPL ratio.","Outside of energy, asset quality remains very strong as evidenced by only 19 basis points of net charge-offs for the rest of the Bank. Tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 12% from the prior year and our fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio declined slightly to 9.7% all reflective of continued improvements and probability combined with effective capital deployment. The course we have set has us performing at a higher level and will continue to propel us into the future.","So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem, to provide more details on this quarter\u2019s performance.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, particularly if you were up last night watching the convention. Let's move on to Slide 4 and taking a look at that slide you'll see that our net interest margin declined five basis points primarily due to lower earning asset yields. As the decline in long-term rates increased premium amortization expense and the low level of absolute rates lowered reinvestment rates across multiple asset classes.","In addition increased long-term debt combined with slightly higher deposit costs contributed to two basis points of the sequential decline. However, net interest income increased $6 million from the prior quarter as solid 2% average loan growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline a further three to five basis points next quarter.","This potential decline is more than we previously anticipated largely due to the significant flattening of the yield curve over the past few months. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet given the prolonged low rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk.","Moving to Slide 5, non-interest income increased $117 million sequentially driven by mortgage which benefited from lower rates other non-interest income and capital markets. Mortgage production income increased $51 million benefiting from strong increases in both purchase and refinancing activity.","In addition we simplified our product offering to include upfront origination fees, and the all-in loan yield, rather than as a separate fee. This change modestly impacts the timing of revenue recognition and increased this quarter's mortgage production income by approximately $10 million.","Other non-interest income increased $37 million primarily due to a gain associated with the sale leaseback of one of our office buildings, which further supports our strategy to reduce our real estate footprint and provides us with increased flexibility in the future.","Investment banking had a strong quarter with revenues increasing $28 million as we continue to see the combination of our long-term investments and strategy deliver solid results for our clients and shareholders. Partially offsetting this increase was a $21 million decrease in trading income, which was largely driven by higher CVA costs, due both to a change in our methodology for calculating counterparty reserves for derivatives and as a result of lower rates.","Client related transaction fees, which includes service charges, card fees, and other fees increased $25 million from the prior quarter, not only due to typical seasonal patterns, but also due to an increase in loan commitment fees in STRH, associated with M&A related bridge financing. Separately, as a reminder, once we fully implement our enhanced posting order process in Q4 of this year, we will see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter.","Let's move on to expenses. Non-interest expense increased $27 million relative to the prior quarter primarily due to discrete charges associated with ongoing efficiency initiatives. These charges were recorded in other non-interest expense and are generally associated with our ongoing branch network optimization efforts. While the savings from these efforts will not be material in the context of our total expense base, they will help continue to make us a more effective company.","In addition, FDIC premium and regulatory exam expenses increased $8 million due to higher assessment fees primarily due to a growing deposit base and a higher assessment rate, the latter of which is mostly due to the increase in non-performing energy loans in recent quarters.","As a reminder, assessment costs will increase an additional $10 million in the third quarter as a result of the FDIC\u2019s new surcharge. Partially offsetting these increases were lower employee compensation expenses, marketing expenses and net occupancy expenses, the latter of which included $6 million of discrete benefits. In comparison to the second quarter of last year, non-interest expense was up 1% largely due to these same discrete charges.","As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 60.1% in the second quarter, an improvement of 350 basis points year-over-year as revenue growth exceeded expense growth. While this quarter's performance was strong, we do not believe a 60% efficiency ratio is our new run rate for the remainder of this year.","With that said, our year-to-date progress keeps us on track to meet our objective of improving the efficiency ratio for the fifth consecutive year. The continued low interest rate environment will clearly impact our go forward trajectory. However, we remain committed to maintaining strong expense discipline and achieving our long-term goal of a sub 60% efficiency ratio.","Turning to Slide 8, asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters. With the divergence between energy and non-energy related performance. Excluding energy, our loan portfolio continues to perform very well evidenced by charge-off of only 19 basis points in the second quarter, and stable to slightly improving delinquency levels.","With respect to energy, we charged off $70 million of loans and our non-performing loans declined from $420 million to $354 million. The total criticized ratio which includes non-accrual loans and criticized accruing loans, remained relatively stable at 30%. Total ALLL for the Company was relatively flat from the prior quarter as growth in the total loan portfolio was offset by continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio.","Total provision expense increased $45 million compared to the first quarter primarily due to the energy charge-offs. From here and assuming no significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we expect NPL levels to decline as we resolve existing energy NPL\u2019s. We continue to expect the Company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 40 basis points for the full-year 2016.","We expect our allowance to be relatively stable in the near-term which should result in a provision expense that approximates net charge-offs. In addition, we expect energy charge-offs to abate as we move through the remainder of 2016 and thus we do expect the total provision expense to decline relative to the second quarter level.","Let's turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans increased 2% from the prior quarter with broad-based growth across most portfolios. Commercial loan growth was driven by C&I and commercial construction, while consumer loan growth was generally broad-based. Our consumer lending strategies continue to produce profitable growth through each of our major channels.","In addition, our overall lending pipelines and dialogue with clients continue to be solid, which we believe is reflective of a steady U.S. economy. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.1 billion or 6% driven by 5% growth in C&I and 15% growth in total consumer loans and was partially offset by declines in home equity and payoffs in commercial real estate.","Turning to Slide 10, average client deposits increased 3% compared to the prior quarter and 8% year-over-year partially due to a large temporary deposit associated with a client related M&A transaction, but largely due to the core growth across most products and businesses. Period and deposits were stable sequentially given typical seasonal patterns from Q1 to Q2.","Over the past two years client deposits are up 15%. This success as a result of our increased focus on meeting more of our clients deposit and payment needs. Our investments and technology platforms and ultimately our teammates and both the consumer and private wealth and wholesale segments.","Rates paid on deposits increased one basis point sequentially, a lagged effect of the December rate increase. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients.","Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2016 CCAR process, and our relative performance within that Bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust continuing to have amongst the lowest levels of loan losses and capital erosion in the severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR Banks.","This progress reflects the significant and cumulative actions we have taken over the past five years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of new loan production. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $960 million over the coming four quarters. In addition, we will increase our common stock dividend from $0.24 to $0.26 subject to Board approval.","In total, this represents a 23% increase and total capital return to shareholders relative to our previous plan. Alongside our increases in capital return, we've also organically added approximately $500 of common equity Tier 1 over the past year and maintain strong capital levels evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio. Tangible book value per share was up 3% sequentially and up 12% compared to the prior year driven by growth and retained earnings and higher AOCI, as a result of lower long-term interest rates.","Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements and we added approximately $1 billion to our securities portfolio in the second quarter to make further progress toward the increased 2017 requirements.","Moving to the segment overviews, we will begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on Slide 12. Net income declined $10 million sequentially and $38 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by a higher provision expense and discrete expenses recognized in the current quarter. On a year-over-year basis, net income trends were also negatively impacted by lower wealth management related income.","Net interest income was stable sequentially and was up 4% versus the prior year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, which more than offset the lower net interest margin. Our consumer direct lending businesses continue to exhibit strong movement. Specifically, average balances are up $2.7 billion or 26% year-over-year, as a result of the investments we have made. In addition to market share gains, we've been able to take in certain businesses, resulting from our strong and stable funding base.","Further, our emphasis on deepening client relationships has driven strong deposit growth, up 4% sequentially and 6% versus the prior year. Some of this growth is due to the large temporary client deposit I mentioned earlier, but the majority of that reflects our emphasis on delivering the Bank's full capabilities to all of our clients.","Both the solid loan and deposit growth trends in CPWM over the past couple of years reflect the increased momentum this business has created in acquiring new clients and deepening existing relationships. Non-interest income was up 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction related fees due to increased consumer activity and normal seasonality.","The year-over-year decline was driven by lower wealth management related revenue which has been pressured by lower assets under management and heightened market volatility. Non-interest expense increased 2% and 4% on a sequential and year-over-year basis respectively. These increases were primarily driven by discrete charges in the current quarter related to our branch network optimization efforts, which I discussed earlier in the presentation.","Optimizing our network continues to be a critical strategic priority, so that we continue to serve our clients when, where, and how they want to do business. In conjunction with branch optimization, profitably growing our consumer lending and wealth management business remains a primary focus in this segment. Executing these priorities should result in steady improvements in both efficiency and the client experience over time.","Moving to wholesale banking, increased credit costs continue to put some downward pressure on net income, but overall client activity levels and market share continue to improve. Revenues were up 1% sequentially due entirely the higher investment banking income. Within investment banking, we had a record quarter in both investment grade bonds and equity originations. The growth of both of these businesses is a strong reflection of the continued strategic investments we've made in recent years.","As an example, we've increased the number of publishing equity research analysts by 30% over the past two years. As a result, our broker rankings have improved and our equity related revenue is growing. Offsetting the increase in investment banking income was a $20 million sequential decline and trading income. The vast majority of this decline was driven by the higher CVA costs I discussed earlier, and excluding this, we would characterize core client trading activity in the second quarter as solid.","Moving to the mortgage segment, which was a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Non-interest income increased $41 million sequentially and $60 million year-over-year. Sequential increase was driven entirely by production income, which was up $51 million as a result of greater purchase and refinancing activity in addition to higher gain on sale margins.","As anticipated, servicing income declined $10 million sequentially as a result of the increased decay expense related to elevated refinancing activity. This was partially offset by additional servicing fees driven by growth in the servicing portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, servicing income increased $22 million due to improved hedge performance, and a 6% increase in the size of our service for others portfolio. These increases in non-interest income combined with strong expense management drove the $19 million sequential and $6 million year-over-year increase in the bottom line.","Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity points to continued positively momentum in mortgage production volumes in response to the low rate environment. While we do not expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate meaningful improvement relative to the third quarter of last year. At a higher level, we continue to be pleased with the increased consistency, improved execution, and targeted growth the mortgage business is delivering to our clients and shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Bill to provide some concluding perspectives.","William Rogers","Okay. Great, thanks Aleem. So to conclude, I'm going to point to Slide 15, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. So first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 7% year-over-year revenue growth.","We have delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and non-interest income and across all three major business segments. In addition, our businesses are working better to deliver the entire bank to our clients. Second, our probability continues to improve as a result of our commitment to tightly manage expenses and drive positive operating leverage. We\u2019ve improved the year-to-date efficiency ratio relative to 2015, putting us well on track to meet our commitment to improve efficiency on an annual basis for the fifth consecutive year.","Third, we've been using many of these efficiency gains to fund growth investments in the Company. There is an example; this quarter was our second best quarter ever for investment banking. We are particularly encouraged by the growth of our core advisory businesses, which take a long-time to develop and are the product of over 10 years of investment.","Today, equity and M&A related revenue account for 39% of investment banking income which was our highest percentage ever. In mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology which has resulted in solid growth and allows us to capitalize on the current market conditions. Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years, and is demonstrating strong consistent momentum.","Also our investments in consumer banking, private wealth management, and treasury and payment solutions are yielding strong results with more clients and trusting their deposits and wealth with SunTrust. And lastly, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and reduce our share count, giving our long-term shareholders a higher ownership stake each quarter.","Now, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the continued low rate environment, which will place pressure on net interest income and profitability trajectory, even though in the near-term it should be a tailwind to mortgage production and capital markets revenue, and we are well positioned there.","However, the low interest rate pressure is applicable to the entire industry, and I am confident if we continue to execute our strategy, fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being for our clients SunTrust will continue to sustain our outperformance.","Now with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ankur, and I believe we\u2019ll begin the Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Christine, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] First question is from John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning guys. Bill just mentioned the challenge at a low rate environment, Aleem can you give a little more color on the NIM outlook, you mentioned three to five basis points next quarter in a flat rate environment? Just walk us through the drivers of that and do you still think you could grow net interest income dollars from the 2Q level, what\u2019s the degree of difficulty on growing and NII from here?","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, John. Yes, if you recall at the start of the year, our view on rates overall was that we were only expecting one interest rate hike in 2016 and we expected that in the latter part of the year. Now with the impact of the vote in the UK, obviously that rate hike looks like it's going to be less probable than we had originally anticipated.","As a result, if we think about the drivers of NIM from here, we are expecting NIM to grind down a little bit in Q3 perhaps a little bit more in Q4. The main drivers of that would be new production yields across many of our portfolios are still a little bit lower than current portfolio levels.","Another driver would be that we continue to build our securities portfolio to prepare for 2017 LCR requirements. So for those two reasons, NIM may continue to decline a little bit. But if you think about the last few years on net interest income, what you've seen with us John is that we've been able to use growth and loans and deposits to offset the declines in NIM over the last several years. Even though, our NIM has dropped about 30, 35 basis points over the last few years. Net interest income for us has been until last year very flat.","In the last year with the growth in NIM, we were able to achieve net interest income really took off and we were on a very steep upward sloping trajectory. From here on with NIM starting to decline, again we do think that with the loan and deposit growth we've got, we will be able to grow net interest income again. However, I'd say that it's going to be at a relatively low pace.","John McDonald","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Matt O\u2019Connor of Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","William Rogers","Hi, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I think about half of the net charge-offs this quarter for the firm overall related to energy and you did talk about them moderating going forward, but any estimate on how much energy loss in total is left, if oil prices stay around here?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. Matt, if I take a look at what our energy charge-offs have been over the last three quarters, they've been about $90 million so far over three quarters. If I take a look at the profile that we've got in the book now, how good that looks and of course as you know the majority of our energy book is actually downstream and midstream as opposed to upstream and oilfield services.","I think we're about halfway through or perhaps more than halfway through in terms of energy charge-offs. And what comes in terms of new energy charge-offs from here might come over the course of the next three or four quarters. So that's why I expect to see declining energy charge-offs from here and therefore a decline in our provision expense from Q2.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then as a follow-up, just across the consumer portfolios I think the delinquencies were stable there, but how are the auto portfolio, the online lending subsidiary you have, how are those businesses performing?","William Rogers","Yes. Matt, I think remember our portfolio as a prime to super prime portfolio both in the auto as well as in the - particularly in the online portfolio. So the auto book is continued to perform well, 40 basis points charge-offs in early stage below 90 and those are low points, I mean they're low relative to historical numbers, but we've stressed this portfolio, we've looked at it hard, we looked at used car values and all the things that could happen to the portfolio and feel good about where we're positioned again.","We don't do sub-prime autos, so we sort to stay at a different place as it relates to that and then as it relates to the LightStream business and Greensky I mean remember again super prime business, FICO scores 750\/770 kind of you know on the high end of the range and similarly there we\u2019re seeing continued strong credit performance. Consumer\u2019s in good shape I mean particularly if the prime and the super prime level you know all throughout our portfolio, Consumer\u2019s in good shape.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Usdin","Thanks. Good morning.","William Rogers","Good morning, Ken.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Kenneth Usdin","I believe you talked about that, the second half efficiency ratio might not stay down around the 60% level, the strong performance you had this quarter. Typically, you guys tend to have lower expenses in the second half. So I'm just wondering, why can\u2019t it stay down here? And I'll throw my just follow-up in there. Is there something about your expected fees that perhaps you'll see a drip up from the current quarter performance? Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks Ken. I think you've partially answered your question. Yes, I think there are several things why the efficiency ratio may be a little bit higher in the second half than it was in this quarter. One obviously the NIM decline is going to put - is going to have some downward pressure on net interest income and we're going to be working hard to grow net interest income from here.","But we know we've got some increased expenses coming up in the second half. FDIC assessment fees will go up $10 million a quarter starting in Q3. Remember, we've got our posting order change coming in Q4, which will probably reduce our fee income by about $10 million a quarter starting in Q4. And then typically for us outside processing and software is on a normal seasonal basis is normally a little bit higher in the second half then it is in the first half as new applications come online over the course of the year and we start amortizing some of that cost.","So for those reasons I think the overall efficiency ratio you know maybe a little bit higher in the second half then in Q2. But year-over-year I think is the big key. We know and we've always targeted over the last four years, targeted improved efficiency year-over-year. We\u2019ve not actually focused on that much on an individual quarter basis.","Our intent is to continue to make this Company more effective and more efficient in the current years than it was in the past year and more effective and more efficient in the next year than it was this year. So this year we still do expect to beat our efficiency ratio from last year and then we're going to be looking to see how it can continue to improve next year.","William Rogers","Ken this is Bill. I want to be clear on a couple of things I mean obviously we don\u2019t annualize any one quarter from an efficiency ratio even if it's high or if it\u2019s low, we look at sort of that annualized run rate and as Aleem said I mean we're committed to continue to make improvements, but we did get a taste of it, and we sort of like it. So I want to be clear that our intensity is at a very, very high level related to our efficiency ratio and we're not slacken off one single bit.","Kenneth Usdin","Understood. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning, guys.","William Rogers","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","First on the loan front, just want to see if you can give a little bit of color into the C&I growth, or the C&I trends in the quarter and the period basis looks like your C&I loans were down. So not sure if that's energy or whatnot. So, if you could just talk about that a little bit, and then also your appetite to grow commercial real estate here, just want to get your thoughts there? Thanks.","William Rogers","Yes, let me - as we've said many times we're careful not to manage to loan growth. So what I look at as I look at production and then I look at loan sales and pay downs and then I look at utilization. So utilization was actually up just to give a little data point. And generally, I don\u2019t talk a lot about utilization because it goes quarter-to-quarter but this was the highest point in the last several - almost eight quarters. So it's worth noting now it's not a lot, but it's worth noting that\u2019s up.","Our production numbers for the quarter were actually really good. As a matter of fact, it was one of our higher quarters from a production standpoint, but we also got a little bit of increase in pay downs. So that sort of got the net-net part of that. The C&I portfolio year-over-year has got great room. Again, quarter-to-quarter we\u2019re sort of careful about that, but year-over-year is good solid double-digit growth in C&I loans.","As it relates to CRE, I think we've said this before, on the production side we're back. I mean that\u2019s somewhat market driven and somewhat driven by our own desires, but outstandings are going to go up a little bit and I think that will trend that way for several quarters as the velocity of construction loans sort of staying on the books a little bit longer by the way which we're happy with high quality, well underwritten. We're happy with, but the velocity of getting those off the books was going to slow a little bit. And part of that you saw in those production numbers I talked about.","John Pancari","Got it. That's helpful. And then one last thing Bill to flip over to the capital front. I heard you discussed your deployment plans, in terms of M&A just want to get your updated thoughts there I mean you are one of the few larger banks that can actually do some deals here, but I wanted to get your thoughts on your interest in whole bank M&A and even non-bank? Thanks.","William Rogers","Yes. We've been really clear that the bank we like the most is SunTrust and you can see the investments we've been making in our Company and I would include in fairness that the last several years, that\u2019s the equivalent of a lot of small bank acquisitions in terms of investment in our own Company and we like that best. So whole bank M&A really is not a primary focus for us at this particular juncture.","On the non-bank side, I mean we continue to be interested, we continue to think that there are opportunities there. Generally things that would be fee-income oriented things that would be accretive to our strategies and accretive to our KPI's fast would be the type of priorities.","Aleem Gillani","John, you\u2019ve seen this in the last couple of years, we've done a couple of small transactions, small fill-in businesses that help us grow our service level to our clients and we continue to look at those and look for those.","John Pancari","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Good morning.","William Rogers","Good morning, Erika.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Just wanted to follow-up a few of your peers had given guidance beyond 2016 given the changed outlook for interest rates. And I'm wondering if you could give us some insight on how much progress you think you can achieve on efficiency improvement beyond 2016 without any assist from rates? And I guess here is my follow-up question is the 69% efficiency ratio at CPWM a potential opportunity? Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","Erika, overall as you know we continue to try to grow or improve the efficiency of the Company overall. We are working on several ways to continue to do this. We don't really focus on sort of specific expense control programs. It\u2019s sporadic, intermittent programs don't tend we think to build a culture of continuous improvement.","And I think what we like about our teammates at SunTrust is that we do have a culture of continuous improvement to try to manage expenses and improve efficiency of the Company overall in every segment. And we continue to look at several ways to continue to do that. We are looking at operations costs, at improving our use of technology overall, we\u2019re continuing to look to optimize our real estate footprint, you saw a little bit of that this quarter with sale leaseback of one particular asset.","We are being very disciplined in how we manage rules and responsibilities, staffing, and we're looking at that across, we\u2019re looking at these things as well as supplier management, the number of vendors we have across every one of our segments including CPWM. And within consumer banking and private wealth, we\u2019re looking at several ways. We can continue to grow and improve our efficiency there including adding revenue and adding frontline facing teammates who can improve our efficiency ratio actually by growing revenue. So we've got several initiatives underway as part of an overall continuous improvement approach.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. I\u2019d say not much more guidance than we would expect the efficiency to continue to improve irrespective of the rates long-term that slope may change, but we would expect to continue to improve.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Vivek Juneja of JPMC. Line is now open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, couple of clarifications Bill and Aleem. One thing so - just looking at the absolute level of expenses for the past you\u2019ve given some guidance on it, the $10 million increase in the FDIC assessment fees and obviously up and down based on incentive driven revenues. Other than that anything else on the and obviously we take out the non-core items you highlighted this quarter, taking all that out anything else we should be mindful off as we think about that line?","William Rogers","Vivek, if you are asking about sort of core expenses and then revenues relative to what we pointed out. Now, I think what we try to do here is be very, very transparent with you as to all of the non-core items that affected us this quarter. You saw them on the - the major items on the first page of the deck as you say I talked about a couple of the minor items that we see coming up.","So I think you've got all the information that we can provide on what the core earnings power of the Company is likely to be over the course of the next little while. And I think the one point I would reiterate is from provision expense with everything that we're seeing today, I do expect that to decline as we go forward from today.","Vivek Juneja","Great. One more different topic dividend payout, Bill and if you can give us some - so how are you thinking about that, you got a dividend increase, but you are still the lowest some of your regional peers are any thoughts on that?","William Rogers","Yes. We set on the course similar to the efficiency ratio to say we want to continue to improve our return to shareholders and we've done that consistently, we've gone from the 60's to the 80's in terms of total return and we've said long-term that sort of that in the zone that we want to be and all that against the backdrop of a really good strong capital level. So I think just on a net basis, we would continue to the same story of efficiency ratio, we continue to improve our return to shareholders, that return probably improvement will be at a smaller slop, but I still think we have an opportunity to increase the return.","Aleem Gillani","And Vivek, we had a pretty clear choice in our planned submission this year as to how we could choose to improve dividends or payouts overall. We chose to do it in a balanced way with some dividend increase and some repurchase increase, but as you point out we did lean more toward repurchase and that made a lot of sense to us in the context of stock price that was only around 1.3 times tangible book.","So that kind of level it makes sense for us to increase the repurchase more than the dividend and every year as we submit our plan, we'll be looking at what those numbers look like. And we also took feedback from many of our largest shareholders as to what their preferences were. So we incorporated that within our plan and we intend to continue to do that.","Vivek Juneja","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Line is now open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Aleem, I wanted to - this is more just a calculation, but when you did your efficiency ratio I believe the way that you did if I look back in the appendix was you left in the gains in the charges. I don't know that you excluded those, if you included them which it looks like you did they had actually a positive effect on your efficiency ratio this particular quarter, so just those unusual items rolling off what actually round you from 60 up to 61. Just want to make sure that was - look at that right?","Aleem Gillani","Marty, you're right, we didn't make an adjustment for these items, they weren\u2019t really very substantial, they weren\u2019t material enough, for example for us to go out and release an 8-K on them, but we just wanted to be very transparent with everybody on. Here is our core items, here is our non-core items you can choose to make whatever calculation you want, but we try to show you everything that was core and non-core so that you got a sense of what the real underlying earnings power of SunTrust is and how it can grow. And then you can make adjustments as you see fit we try to give you the adjustments we thought make sense.","Marty Mosby","No, I was just trying to highlight that that has a 1% rounding up so not really an operational or a pressure just you know as you move forward you don't have those unusual gains still left in the numbers. The other thing I want to ask you was if you look at the asset quality, the charge-offs and the back in the fourth quarter was the non-performers going up and then now you're charging of these energy loans.","Your exposure looks on the surface to be better positioned, but it looks like you had a couple of larger loans that you were dealing with and have been dealing with through this process. Do you feel like you're getting through the process of dealing with those particular loans and that the underlying strength of the portfolio will eventually start to show through here?","Aleem Gillani","Thank you, Marty. That\u2019s a very insightful question on the bones of our portfolio and I think you nailed it. We had a couple of charge-offs in the energy book that perhaps raised our charge-off level a little bit higher this quarter. But when you peel it back you see energy charge-offs or you see our total charge-off level including energy only a 39 basis points deal within what we expect to achieve for a full-year guidance even including these couple of items.","And ex-energy as I said we've got a charge-off level in the whole rest of the book up only 19 basis points. So, the rest of our book has a credit profile that frankly looks terrific. And as we work our way through the energy issues in the short-term. I think you'll see the power of the rest of the portfolio coming through relatively quickly.","William Rogers","Yes, Marty. I think rather than continuing to say we're pristine as it relates to the energy portfolio, we were very diligent and very focused and we've assembled a tight group focused on this portfolio because we really want to come out of this quarter saying that we\u2019ve crested that we've got most of this behind us from a charge-off standpoint as Aleem said I think we're clearly more than halfway through. And then that will have the positive impact on the provision going forward. So we put a lot of shoulder to the wheel on this quarter to be able to say we're crested.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Matthew Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Aleem may be my first question is for you. You mentioned the pace of growth of the securities portfolio will continue to be upward and I notice the yield on the securities portfolio was down about 10 basis points quarter-over-quarter. How much of a headwind is that given your outlook for lower margin in third quarter and further still in the fourth quarter?","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Matt. I think the effect of the securities portfolio is sort of two effects. One is growth in the book at lower coming on yield than the portfolio overall. And then second is the effect on mortgage back amortization. So the combined effects of both of those things in this last quarter was a round up basis point or so. The increase in MBS amortization. So it\u2019s about a basis point or so it may be - as we look forward it is already incorporated in our guidance, but think of it in the context of around a basis point a quarter.","Matthew Burnell","Okay. That's helpful. And then Bill maybe a question for you. You noted your very good CCAR or stress test results and the positive trend in capital returns. I'm curious as to how you and the Board potentially think about considering a mid cycle de minimus exception request to increase your capital returns over the course of the current capital cycle?","William Rogers","Just as a point of history, we've done in every opportunity. So that maybe I ought to give you a little perspective.","Aleem Gillani","Matt, we've done that each of the last two years.","Matthew Burnell","Right. Okay thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Stephen Scouten","Thanks. Good morning. Question for you guys, I guess first maybe to follow-up on some of the NIM questions. Anything that you guys can do assuming that maybe rates stay even lower for longer than we might have previously assumed, any additional strategies that you might pursue or implement moving forward to mitigate further compression here?","Aleem Gillani","I think one of the things that we're doing and you're seeing is our portfolio mix and over time what you're seeing is that we're growing our direct consumer lending portfolio at a very rapid pace, as I said 26%. And that's helping our overall portfolio mix and portfolio yield and that is indeed helping to mitigate the effect of NIM overall.","The other thing that we're doing is we're very actively managing as I said to Matt just a minute ago, our securities book and our swaps book. And as we manage that over time that will also continue to I think help mitigate the effect of lower long-term rates on our book overall.","William Rogers","And then the portions that are dilutive to NIM, we're putting a lot of intensive pressure on relationship return and the good news is we've got the capacity and we've built the capability to be very demanding of our teams to get a lot of fee income and you're seeing that manifest itself in that fee income level. So if we're putting out capital that's dilutive to NIM, we expect to get return that's accretive to non-interest income.","Stephen Scouten","Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And then from a loan growth perspective, obviously after some intentional kind of run-off of some portfolios the last three quarters had just been I mean the growth been phenomenal. Is that at all a sustainable rate, I mean average loan growth call it 8% on average over the last three quarters? Is that in any way sustainable or should we see that come down somewhere 1.5 times kind of GDP growth rate like that?","William Rogers","As we said, I mean we really try not to manage to a loan growth numbers, so we look at production and then we look at pay downs and then we look at things that we may do to Aleem\u2019s point to continue to diversify the balance sheet and get us in a - get a positive position.","Based on the things that we see now relative to all of those pluses and minuses that come in I mean 1% to 2% kind of range is probably not out of the realm of possibility, it\u2019s probably the right sort of zone, but again we don't manage that kind of number.","I mean we really look at are we continuing to get positive production or we continuing to expand what we're doing with relationships and are they meeting all the hurdles. So we've got - for a loan to come on the book, it's got to get through a big gate in terms of overall hurdle rates.","Aleem Gillani","Steve to connect to your questions, we have the great flexibility here at SunTrust to be able to be opportunistic, we've been able to buy portfolios where we see the ability to connect those clients with the rest of our offerings and we have the ability to sell portfolios that we think are non-core or not going to be accretive to value over the long term.","So we've got - as you said decent organic growth, we've got hardworking teammates, but in addition to that we've got great flexibility to be opportunistic to find ways to add value by both buying and selling portfolios.","Stephen Scouten","Great. Thanks guys. That\u2019s really helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Nancy Bush of NAB Research. Your line is now open.","Nancy Bush","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Nancy.","Nancy Bush","If I could just ask a question about the credit cycle sort of an overall question about it, you guys have made rather positive remarks here and as have a number of your regional and larger peers. Has there been a change in the outlook for the credit cycle right now? Because it looked like in the fourth and the first quarters, the commentary was a little bit more down beat and everybody seems to be looking at sort of a new improving credit cycle at this point. Is that a correct observation?","William Rogers","I wouldn't say that we've got sort of an improving credit cycle from here, Nancy. I think we're actually in a terrific part of the cycle overall and you can see that in our numbers and 19 basis points of net charge-offs ex-energy, spectacularly good.","Aleem Gillani","We do think, over the long-term over a cycle that with the credit profile that we've got we should be expecting net charge-offs of between 40 and 70.","Nancy Bush","Right.","Aleem Gillani","That's what's built into our strategic plans and that's what we've talked about is what you should expect over the medium-term. So we're in a very, very good part of the cycle, but to your point and I think this is where you're completely correct. This part has lasted a long time. We've been well under our 40 basis point expectation for many quarters and we continue to stay there. And when I take a look at the credit profile of the new loans that are coming on our books across all three segments, those credit profiles continue to be very, very strong.","Consumer FICO\u2019s, consumer lending FICO\u2019s continue to come on at well north of 750 and in many cases we're talking about 770, 780. And as you know, we're not a sub-prime lender. So the credit profile of what we're putting on continues to be very strong like what we're seeing in wholesale banking and what's coming on there. So it is lasting longer than we had perhaps thought it would a couple of years ago.","William Rogers","Yes, that\u2019s what I was going to answer. I think it's really no change in intensity is just change in time and every quarter it continues to be good, everyone will talk about - that's a quarter more in the cycle.","Nancy Bush","Okay. And if I could just ask as an add on, the OCC has warned about CRE conditions in some markets. I know you guys are not - no longer in OCC Bank, but that's a regulatory warning. I think that sort of cuts across regulatory agencies? Are you backing out of any markets right now or downplaying any markets that you're concerned about CRE?","William Rogers","Well, I say it's not just a market specific kind of comment, but it certainly is a market and product specific comment. So absolutely there are places where we have less intensity related to a product that might be overbuilt in a certain market and we're seeing pockets of that. As I said earlier, I mean our production in CRE will go down now the things that we are doing and the things that we see I mean are positive, but it is not an overall health kind of metric. It's that proverbial heat map.","And Nancy you know as well I mean the way that we're organized now allows us to really manage that heat map so much better than the way we organized before. So we can really holdback one market and one product and emphasize another product in another market relative to the help of those clients, the support of those clients and what might be going on in any particular area.","Nancy Bush","Yes. Could you just speak to that heat map in Florida if you would?","William Rogers","Yes. It's interesting because there is a lot of the parts of Florida continue to be really good. We've not been a big player in the condo market in Miami all the way through and we continue not to be a big player. Multifamily there were so to keep an eye on that would be a good example.","The other markets in Florida from an industrial standpoint are much better. Job creation in Florida, remember Florida is one of the top job creating states in the country. The port business in Florida is good. We see a lot of the east coast - the west coast to east coast migration happening and the building that goes along with all the increased ford activity in Florida.","So there are a couple of pockets that would be a good example and then maybe talk about sort of housing in general. We keep a close eye on housing in general overall in Florida. As you might imagine, we have probably the most heightened sensitivity of that of anybody.","And we continue to be with really good developers. We continue to see pockets of opportunity. There's not a lot of crazy stuff going on. There's not a lot of land accumulation. There is not a lot of two guys in a truck. All the things that we got worried about, but relative exposure is well managed within that geography.","Nancy Bush","Thank you very much.","Aleem Gillani","Nancy, would you step back and look at our CRE book overall. It's very well diversified by geography and asset class. And as you know, we've got zero delinquencies in our CRE book today and a criticized loan exposure level of only about 2%.","Nancy Bush","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","William Rogers","Christine, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Last question is from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","William Rogers","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Coming back to your capital, you guys are obviously very well capitalized, Aleem you pointed to the success that you had during CCAR is being one of the lowest reductions in your CET1 ratio. I think you came in over 7% with the bogey being 4.5%. You also pointed out that acquisitions are really not what you're interested in doing at this time.","So the question is your CET1 ratio of 9.7%, do you consider that to be too high and if it is too high would you - the change that we expect in next year's CCAR of not having the qualitative part of the test being applicable to Banks with under $250 billion in assets? Is than an opportunity for SunTrust to really give back much more in a one-time kind of special dividend or buyback to bring those capital levels down to drive the profitability higher?","Aleem Gillani","Well Gerard, I think our view is indeed similar to the one you just espoused at 9.7%. That is more capital than we need to fundamentally run the operations of this Company and it is more capital and we need when you look at the very strong risk profile across all of our books. What you have seen with us is that we have been looking for ways and finding ways to allow that ratio to drift down a little bit, the increase in dividend, the increase in buyback.","What you should see with us over time is that that 9.7 should continue to drift down a little bit attempt here, attempt there and come down to something but over time I wouldn't say, I wouldn\u2019t expect a one-time massive repayment but that over time we'd be able to bring it to something that is value added for all of our shareholders rather than retaining as much excess as we have today.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. And would you guys could consider the CCAR capital requirements you\u2019re binding constraint on capital?","Aleem Gillani","It has been until now and as we look at what next year brings to CCAR once we get some clarity on what the rules are going to look like for Banks in our position. We'll evaluate whether that continues to be so.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then just as a follow-up on the quality of the commercial real estate book that you guys have pointed out in the underwriting part of the cycle? Can you give us some color obviously you've been through cycles? Why this is one so far been so much better in terms of lasting longer was that the severity of the downturn that\u2019s still fresh in all of our minds or why is that so good for so long?","William Rogers","I think there are a couple of reasons one is I think as an industry we\u2019ve been more demanding on structure so there's just a lot more equity in this part of the cycle, they are bigger players in this part of the cycle. I think particularly about the single family part you know it's dominated now by bigger players, lot more capital and lot more staying power.","There\u2019s been a lot of equity available, they're accepting returns that are perhaps lower so that allows them to have more equity in the deals. So I just think there is been a - we tend to have short memories and I think maybe in the case of commercial real estate our memories are little longer this cycle than it has been in the past. But it\u2019s something in fairness for all of us to be watching.","Gerard Cassidy","Sure. Bill, Aleem thank you so much.","William Rogers","Thanks.","Ankur Vyas","Okay, Christine.

We delivered 3% revenue growth, driven by net interest income as a result of both margin expansion and strong broad-based loan growth.","The loan growth we delivered this year is driven by the strategies of and the investments in our businesses, including consumer lending, CRE, and commercial banking. The success of our advice-oriented model and our increasing relevance with our corporate client base. Market conditions made fee-income growth more challenging in 2018, particularly within capital markets and mortgage.","Nonetheless, the diversity of our business model enabled us to deliver solid overall revenue growth. We achieved our sub-60 adjusted tangible efficiency ratio target, a year earlier than we anticipated. We originally set this target back in 2012 when our efficiency ratio was 72%. At the time, this was a highly aspirational target. We did not know when we would get there, but it was important to be ambitious. While this is a milestone, as we\u2019ve said before, it is not a stopping point.","And finally, we delivered 41% growth in capital returns to our earnings. Our dividend per share increased by 36% and today we have a 3.5% dividend yield. Additionally, over the last two-quarters we purchased $1.25 billion worth of shares and have $750 million of capacity in the first half of 2019. The net result of our progress across these three fronts, coupled with a favorable operating environment was a 40% increase in adjusted earnings per share.","Importantly, our progress this year is consistent with a longer-term trend. 2018 marked the seventh consecutive year of higher earnings per share, improved efficiency, and higher capital returns. This progress, which builds up on a higher base each year is just one indicator of the culture of continuous improvement and high performance we\u2019ve instilled across the company. ","Relatedly, we\u2019re adding a new medium-term efficiency target of 56% to 58%, which formalizes comments I\u2019ve made in the past that we see several hundred basis points of additional opportunity. Our pace of improvement in any given year will vary based on macro-economic environment and the investments we may pursue, but have confidence in our ability to make continuous improvements each year as we work towards this targeted range. ","As it relates to fourth quarter results, I\u2019ll let Allison get into the details, but on a high-level we ended the year with strong revenue. In fact, revenue in the fourth quarter was a high watermark for the year. This was primarily driven by continued growth and net interest income in addition to a very good quarter and commercial real estate related fee income, which more than offset the impact of market conditions and on capital markets revenue. ","Separately, credit quality continues to be a strength for us. Not only because of the favorable operating environment, but also because of our disciplined risk culture. Our consistently lower charge off ratio, which was 26 basis points in the fourth quarter and 23 basis points for the full-year combined with the strength in asset quality drove a 4-basis point decline in our ALLL ratio for the fourth quarter.","Leading and lagging indicators of credit quality continue to be very strong and we remain optimistic on our outlook for the U.S. economy. We will be diligent in monitoring for any changes and most certainly will maintain our focus on diversity and a conservative credit, risk posture, helping position our company and balance sheet for more consistent through the cycle performance.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Allison to cover some more of the specifics.","Allison Dukes","Thanks Bill and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start with net interest income on Slide 5. Our net interest income increased by $36 million or 2% sequentially, driven by strong loan growth. Our net interest margin was stable sequentially as the benefit of the September rate hike was offset by higher wholesale funding to support the loan growth in the quarter.","Looking to the first quarter, we expect the net interest margin to be generally stable relative to the fourth quarter. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment, future levels of loan growth, and funding cost. As a reminder, there are two fewer days in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, which negatively impacts net interest income by approximately $10 million per day all else equal.","Now moving to Slide 6, noninterest income increased by $36 million sequentially, driven primarily by commercial real estate-related income. Specifically, our structured real estate business had a good quarter and the other two components of this line item SunTrust Community Capital and SunTrust Agency Lending are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter.","Our strength in CRE fee-income more than offset the decline in capital markets-related income, which was impacted by market conditions. Investment banking income declined due to lower high-yield and equity origination activity as investor sentiment declined throughout the quarter. Within trading income, our corporate bond inventory for clients was mark-to-market lower.","However, we had record capital markets revenue from our non-CIB clients, which tend to be less impacted by market conditions. Mortgage-related income was stable sequentially as lower production income was offset by higher servicing income, both generally consistent with seasonal trends.","Separately, going forward and beginning with the 10-K, we will combine our mortgage production and servicing line items into a consolidated mortgage-related income line item. Other non-interest income increased sequentially as mark-to-market losses of certain FinTech equity investments were offset by mark-to-market gains on our credit default swap hedge portfolio.","Moving to expenses on Slide 7. As we disclosed last quarter, we terminated a legacy pension plan that we acquired as a part of the National Commerce Financial acquisition in 2004. This resulted in a one-time $60 million charge and helped de-risk the balance sheet. This charge had a minimal impact of book value as the settlement simply shifted unrealized losses within AOCI through the P&L and into retained earnings.","Excluding this, expenses increased by $38 million, driven by certain discrete item and normal quarterly variability. Within operating losses, we had higher legal related expenses and elevated fraud-cost. Additionally, a large tenant in one of our owned office buildings terminated their lease early, which benefited net occupancy expense in the third quarter.","Lastly, other non-interest expense increased due to the cost associated with the termination of a vendor contract, a decision we made as a part of our ongoing efficiency effort. These discrete items were partially offset by lower regulatory assessments as a result of the removal of the FDIC surcharge, which was a $19 million benefit, in addition to a separate one-time $9 million FDIC refund. Outside processing and software expense increased 3% sequentially, and 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The primary driver is increased software amortization expense for new and upgraded technology assets. ","As a reminder, our core personnel expenses, which excludes the $60 million pension charge in the fourth quarter, should increase by approximately $60 million to $75 million in the first quarter, due to the typical seasonal increase in benefits and FICA cost. Our effective tax rate was 16% in 2018 as we benefited from certain discrete tax benefits as a result of the finalization of tax reform.","Looking into 2019, we would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and 20% to 21% if you model us on an FTE basis. As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 58.6% for the quarter and 59.6% for the full-year. We achieved 150 basis points of improvement this year. The highest degree of improvement we have delivered since 2014. Even more notable when considering to 40 basis point FTE calculation headwind from 2017 to 2018 given lower tax rates. This strong progress enabled us to reach our sub-60% target one year earlier than our stated goal.","The benefits of this progress combined with less macroeconomic tailwinds will mean that 2019 improvement will be less than 2018. However, we continue to expect momentum as we work towards our medium-term target of 56% to 58%. Equally important, we remain focused on continuing to create capacity to invest in technology and talent, given the compelling opportunities we have, which we believe will create the most long-term value for our clients and our owners.","Our performance in 2018 validates our ability to do this. As an example, outside processing and software costs, which is where a portion of our technology spend resides, increased by 10%. However, our overall adjusted expense base declined by 1% as a result of our ongoing efficiency initiatives, including a significant organizational restructuring we conducted in the latter half of 2017.","Moving now to Slide 9, our net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the fourth quarter, consistent with our prior guidance. The low level of net charge-offs reflects the relative strength we are seeing across all of our portfolios. Performance we are extremely pleased with that we remain cognizant that there could be some variability and normalization going forward. Nonperforming loans declined from 47 basis points to 35 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven by the resolution of certain C&I credit. The ALLL ratio declined by 4 basis points sequentially, as a result of continued asset quality improvement.","Provision expense increased by $26 million as a result of higher loan growth in the fourth quarter. More broadly, we continue to maintain a strong overall risk discipline. In addition to the credit quality results, this is evidenced by the effectiveness of our low bar approach in CIB, our ability to fully syndicate all leverage lending transactions in the fourth quarter, our proactive hedging process in both our credit and MSR portfolios, and our relatively neutral interest rate risk positioning.","Looking into 2019, we would expect our net charge-off ratio to be between 25 basis points and 30 basis points for the full-year. We do expect the ALLL ratio to generally stabilize from here, which would result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs given loan growth.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 10. The improved lending trends we saw in the second and third quarters continued in the fourth quarter with average loans up 2.5% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. The growth was diversified across C&I, CRE, consumer lending and mortgage. Wholesale loan growth was broad-based across each of our lines of business. Within CIB, loan growth was primarily driven by M&A activity, and modestly higher revolver utilization.","Commercial banking growth was largely driven by seasonal increases in our auto dealer portfolio in addition to continued positive trends in our ageing services vertical and our expansion markets. CRE growth continued as a result of investments we have made in permanent lending and bridge lending capabilities, which is being partially offset by run-off in the construction portfolio.","Within consumer, the ongoing investments we have made in our digital and point-of-sale capabilities, which provide for superior client experience are also driving growth and enhancing our returns. Our mortgage, auto, and credit card portfolios also demonstrated solid and steady growth in the quarter. Across the wholesale and consumer, our underwriting discipline has not changed and we remain highly focused on ensuring that the quality of our new production is consistent with the quality of our existing portfolio.","On the deposit side, average balances increased sequentially, driven by seasonal growth in NOW accounts. As anticipated, we continue to see a migration from lower cost deposits to CDs, largely due to a higher-rates, and our targeted strategy, which allows us to retain our existing depositors and capture new market share.","Interest-bearing deposit costs increased 10 basis points sequentially, slightly lower than the prior quarter increase of 11 basis points. We expect deposit costs to continue to trend upwards, but the trajectory will be influenced by the rate environment in addition to the levels of loan growth we are delivering. At the same time, we remain focused on investing in products and capabilities, which enhance the client experience outside of rate paid.","Moving to Slide 11, which provides an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.2%, and the Tier 1 ratio was 10.3%. Those are down relative to the prior quarter due to strong loan growth and a higher share repurchase in the fourth quarter. ","We continue to make progress towards our 8% to 9% target CET1 ratio. In accordance with our 2018 capital plan, we have $750 million of remaining authorization for the first and second quarters of 2019. Our capital plan does contemplate a preferred issuance as we work towards optimizing our capital ratios. However, the timing of that issuance will depend on market conditions.","Now moving to the segment overviews, we\u2019ll begin with consumer on Slide 12. We made good financial progress across most metrics and consumer in 2018. We delivered strong operating leverage with revenues up 4% and expenses up 1%, resulting in 200 basis points of efficiency improvement and a 55% increase in net income, which was bolstered by lower tax rate and strong credit quality. Coming into 2018, a key area of focus and investment for us was to build on the momentum we had with our digital and point-of-sale consumer lending platform.","Specifically, within life stream, we focus on enhancing our marketing and analytics efforts adding new product offerings, including a new home improvement loan and growing our partnership and referral channels. Within point-of-sale lending, we focus on adding additional partners to diversify our portfolio. ","We had two additional partners, both focused on aspects of home improvement. While these two partnerships are small in the context of the overall company, they reflect our investments and purpose-based point-of-sale digital financing. These investments have put us at the forefront of when and where consumers make their lending decision.","LightStream and third-party partnerships combined, delivered approximately $2 billion in loan growth in 2018, improving growth and returns within the Consumer segment. The loan growth we delivered continues to be high quality. Our new production FICO\u2019s within consumer lending averaged 766 in 2018, stable relative to 2017, which is a reflection of our consistent underwriting discipline and conservative risk posture.","Importantly, we were able to fund the entirety of our loan growth and consumer with deposit growth. We were early and intentional in promoting CDs to both attract new clients and retain existing clients. This proved to be an effective strategy. We generated approximately $3 billion in CD growth within consumer and 42% of our production was new money. On the fee income side, there were headwinds, particularly within the markets line of business, which represents nearly 20% of consumers fee income and was down $80 million, compared to 2017 as a result of lower volume and compressed margins.","Some of these declines were offset by wealth management where we are seeing positive underlying trends. One of our primary areas of focus within wealth management in 2018 was hiding new advisers and expanding into new markets. New production AUM in 2018 was $4.2 billion, 70% higher than 2017, which helped offset the market pressures we felt in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Improved revenues coupled with our ongoing expense discipline drove a 200-basis point improvement in efficiency, helping consumers make significant progress towards its medium-term objective. This was driven by a number of actions in 2017 and 2018, including organizational restructuring, more automation within the middle and back office of private wealth, the merger of SunTrust Mortgage and SunTrust Bank, and increasing digital adoption, which is directly correlated with our ability to rationalize our physical footprint. ","We also made significant strides in improving the client experience, largely driven by our ongoing investments in technology. We created the first API to connect our front-end and back-end mortgage system. The results of which is a fully digital mortgage application, Smart Guide, which we introduced in March. Since its introduction, we have already achieved 64% adoption and should see further progress from here. This not only provides for superior client experience, it also streamlines our underwriting process and reduces loan cycle origination time.","For our private wealth clients, we introduced a new digital client portal, which provides clients with a bespoke, holistic view of all aspects of their financial life and includes enhanced financial planning tools. These investments combined with our talented team played a significant role in the national recognition we received in 2018, some of which is highlighted at the bottom of Slide 12.","2018 was a good year for consumer and we\u2019re pleased with the progress we made in enhancing the client experience, improving our efficiency and effectiveness, and making investments, which position us for future success as we work to anticipate and exceed evolving client expectations.","Moving to the wholesale segment, on Slide 13, we had another strong year despite challenging market conditions in the last few months of the year. Our success is evident in both topline and bottom-line results. We achieved record revenue and net income in 2018. Revenues grew by 2%, driven entirely by net interest income as a result of NIM expansion and 1% loan growth, and net income grew by 24% driven by $67 million or 3% increase in pre-provision net revenue.","Big picture, it\u2019s clear that we have a competitive advantage within this business. We win because of our focus on the middle markets, the quality of our people, the advice they deliver, and the way we work together. It was encouraging to see lending trends improve relative to 2017 when our strong production levels were being masked by elevated paydowns and lower utilization.","On the C&I side, much of our growth was driven by M&A, increased revolver utilization and the investments we\u2019ve made in expanding our ageing services vertical and the geographical reach of our commercial banking business, most recently evidenced by the announcement of our new Houston commercial office in November. On the CRE side, we saw good growth and positive remixing within the portfolio, as a result of the investments we made in new lending capabilities.","Historically, we did not have the product suite to participate in the full life cycle of an asset and we were heavily weighted towards the construction phase. In 2017, we added permanent and bridge financing capabilities, which helped us replace the run-off in the construction portfolio with high-quality funded assets. Importantly, this loan growth did not come at the expense of risk or return discipline. Our model is focused on leading with advice, not structure or price. As proof, our revenues from loan syndications were down 15%, which is the reflection of both market conditions, the impact nonbank lenders had on the space and our discipline.","We have a highly skilled and disciplined syndications team and we passed on a number of transactions where the structures did not comply with our standard. While noninterest income was down largely as a result of market conditions there are very positive underlying trends, which validate our strategic progress. First, we had record performance in M&A and equity originations. Two strategic areas of our capital markets platform, which are in earlier stages of their maturation and growth.","Second, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing great momentum and delivering capital markets products and solutions to our commercial banking, CRE, and private wealth client. Compared to 2017, capital markets revenue from these clients increased 49%, a clear reflection of our ability to work effectively across lines of business within Wholesale as one team. And third, we had a particularly good year in structured real estate as a result of our strong client relationship and deep structuring expertise.","Other than consumer, across wholesale, we remain focused on investing in technology with the goal of arming our teammates with the tools they need to maximize their effectiveness and provide clients with an improved experience, especially within treasury and payments. In 2018, we completed the transition to SunView, our new treasury and payments platform, and we\u2019re now focused on expanding SunView into a broader wholesale client portal.","Big picture, we continue to see the benefits of our advice driven model and are pleased with the progress we made in meeting more client needs, providing superior execution for our client's in varying market conditions, elevating our relationship, and making investments which position us for future success as we work to anticipate and exceed client expectations. Our investment banking and lending pipelines are solid, and we feel well-positioned to meet our client's needs both in benign and more challenging markets.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks Allison. So, to conclude, I\u2019ll go to Slide 14, which highlights how our performance this year builds upon our longer-term trends. As you can see, for each of the last seven years, we\u2019ve delivered higher earnings per share, improved efficiency, and higher capital returns. While our financial performance in 2018 were strong, I want to highlight some of the underlying trends and progress we made in 2018, which drove these results, all of which supports our investment thesis.","The first pillar of our investment thesis is investing in growth and technology. We have been and will continue to be incredibly disciplined about making consistent strategic investments to diversify our revenue mix, improve the client experience, and position us for future success. As an example, one of our key priorities has been to deliver on our capital markets capabilities to our commercial banking CRE and PWM clients.","As Allison mentioned, we saw the benefits of our successful execution here in 2018, capital markets revenue from non-CIB clients reached a record level in the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the full-year this client segment grew to represent 20% of our total capital markets revenue. Our ability to capture additional market share within this non-CIB client segment, which tends to be less impacted by market conditions helped offset some of the headwinds we faced.","Within consumer, we made significant investments in technology that puts SunTrust at the center of our client's decision-making and financial planning. We recognize that consumer preferences are evolving rapidly and investments we have made in our digital and point-of-sale lending capabilities have put SunTrust at the forefront of when and where clients make a decision.","The growth we produced in consumer lending this year was a key driver of our loan growth, our improved net interest margin, and our balance sheet diversity. More broadly, we made good progress in advancing our technology position in 2018 between ongoing improvements to our mobile and online capabilities for consumer clients, the introduction of our enterprise client portal for private wealth clients, our new SmartGUIDE digital mortgage application, and the final roll-out of SunView, we significantly improved the client experience in 2018.","In addition, we made investments in teammate-facing platform such as our digital client conversation guide to make it easier for teammates to anticipate and meet more client needs. Lastly, we made good progress in modernizing our infrastructure by moving more of our digital properties to the cloud and making further enhancements to our security capabilities.","The second pillar of our investment thesis is improving efficiency and returns. While you can see the strong progress, we made in 2018, may not be as evident as the performance-based culture we\u2019ve created. Continuous improvement is embedded in all aspects of how we run our company and will deliver further efficiency progress each year as we work towards our medium-term target of 56% to 58%.","As we do so, we\u2019re highly focused on making the right trade-offs between saving and investing to maximize a long-term potential. Relatedly focusing too much on one metric will not maximize long-term value for owners, which is why we have a broader focus on returns. In 2018, our ROA improved by 20 basis points and our adjusted ROTCE improved by 470 basis points.","Clearly, some of this improvement is reflective of the benefits of tax reform, but it\u2019s also due to our internal focus on maximizing risk-adjusted returns, and being disciplined about the client business will pursue an accept. We\u2019ll maintain the same level of discipline in 2019 and beyond.","The third and final pillar of our investment thesis is our strong capital and risk position. In 2018, we stayed true to our key tenants of diversity and discipline, the loan growth we produced with high-quality and broad-based. I discipline around areas like leverage lending prevented us from experiencing any latent distribution risk. The low bar approach of our trading business protected our downside risk in the final months of the year as did our credit risk hedging strategies.","And finally, our relatively neutral interest rate risk profile positions us well for potential change in the rate environment. On the capital side, we continued our strong performance in \u2013 our continued strong performance in CCAR afforded us the ability to increase capital returns by 41%, reduce our share count by 5%, and maintain a healthy dividend yield. Going forward, we remain focused on ensuring we have both a strong offense and defense in order to demonstrate more consistent through-the-cycle performance.","I assure you we have been and will remain incredibly vigilant by looking for early warning signs, anticipating future risk, and taking actions accordingly. I\u2019m also proud of the actions we took and behaviors we demonstrated in 2018 to exemplify our purpose and culture. We are a purpose driven company focused on lighting the way to financial well-being. This provides the foundation for our strategy and focus.","Our purpose driven culture is exemplified in our ability to work together as one team, agnostic to products and lines of business, with the ultimate goal of providing clients the solution that meets their needs not ours. At SunTrust, our diverse team is critical in meeting and exceeding client expectations, delivering top financial performance through multiple cycles, and ensuring our purpose drives success.","Not to be remiss if I didn't pause here for a minute and thank all the great SunTrust teammates whose tireless dedication to our purpose relentless focus on our clients were the key contributors to our financial success in 2018. So, team, thank you.","While market conditions may percent certain headwinds in 2019, we\u2019re focused on the factors we can control and I'm highly optimistic about our future. We have a tremendous opportunity to bring our advice-oriented purpose driven model to more wholesale and consumer clients and prospects, we\u2019ll continue to make investments to enhance our technology position, and we\u2019ll continue to deliver improvements and efficiency and we\u2019ll maintain our disciplined conservative risk posture.","So, with that, Ankur, let me turn it back over to you and the q-and-a.","Ankur Vyas","Great. Stacy, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question we\u2019ll go to John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","John McDonald","Guess it\u2019s a question for Allison. Your loan growth was really strong and accelerated this quarter, so just kind of wondering if you could discuss your expectations for loan growth to continue exceeding core deposit growth, and how you guys think about, kind of, evaluate feeling that funding gap, and choosing between wholesale borrowings, debt issuance on the one hand versus going out paying up for online deposits even starting up a national digital strategy. Just, kind of, how you think through that funding gap option and also what\u2019s your comfort zone on where you\u2019d like to be on loan-to-deposit ratio? Thanks.","Allison Dukes","Sure. Let me just start with loan growth and our outlook there. I mean you did hear us that we\u2019ve got solid pipelines, I think you can expect our loan growth to continue to be good throughout 2019 as Bill noted. Our outlook on the economy is optimistic, the markets look healthy, our consumers look healthy, businesses look healthy. As I think about our funding sources, I do expect that loan growth likely will continue to modestly outpace deposit growth throughout the year. ","As we think about funding, I mean, we\u2019re obviously balancing growth in deposits with profitability. And it\u2019s a balancing act and we\u2019re carefully looking at the marginal cost of deposit funding against the marginal cost of wholesale funding sources. From a loan-to-deposit ratio perspective, we\u2019re at 93% finishing up the year. And I think we\u2019d be comfortable in that 95% to 100% context. I wouldn't expect to see us go any north of that, but we feel good about the access we have to alternative funding sources whether that\u2019s the unsecured debt market or the FHLB.","John McDonald","Okay. Great and then just a follow-up Allison. What are the puts and takes to your NIM outlook for the fourth quarter that you gave? And if you could just let us know how you're thinking about how hopeful a rate hike is and how you behave on the NIM when there\u2019s not a rate hike that will be great? Thank you.","Allison Dukes","Sure. And I think you\u2019re asking the outlook on our first quarter NIM guidance and the puts and takes there. First, there are certainly the benefit that we will receive from the December rate hike. Second, as we noted, there are two fewer days in the quarter, so \u2013 while that does have a negative impact to NII, it\u2019s helpful to NIM. And then third, offsetting that would be our expectation that funding cost to continue to modestly increase throughout the quarter. And take that all together and we think NIM will be generally stable in the first quarter, and it really will be dependent on loan growth and just overall balance sheet trends. Also, as a reminder and as I noted in the prepared remarks, you do see a seasonal increase in NOW accounts in the fourth quarter that\u2019s really a function of public funds, public deposits coming in the fourth quarter and you\u2019d expect to see those flow out over the course of the first quarter. ","So, that\u2019s factored into the guidance as well. Thinking about quarters beyond the first quarter and what we might expect with or without a Fed rate hike, if we assume the rate environment doesn't change materially from here, as I said, I would expect loan growth to continue to modestly outpace deposit growth. With that in mind, I would expect NIM to be generally stable to may be slightly down in any given quarter. If we did get the benefit of a Fed rate hike that would be modestly helpful to NIM, but it really would be a question of the increase in betas from here. And as we approach a 50% beta or so in any given quarter that does largely offset the impact or the benefit of a Fed rate hike.","John McDonald","Great. Thank you.","Operator","We now go to the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning everybody. Congratulations on the results. First, on the efficiency ratio, this is a bit more of a clarification, and sorry if I missed it. There\u2019s a lot of multitasking this morning, but, Allison, I think you mentioned for 2019 you do expect to see continued efficiency ratio improvements, but maybe not at the pace you had in 2018, which was I think about 140 basis points on the tangible efficiency ratio, did I get that right? And I think in the past you guys have highlighted something close to maybe 50, 100 basis points per year, is that still sort of a reasonable glide path acknowledging the uncertainties in the revenue environment?","Allison Dukes","Yes. Let me kind of first reflect on what drove that really strong absolute drop in the efficiency ratio in 2018 at 150 basis points that was the most significant improvement we've made in any given year. And there were a couple of tailwinds that were helpful there, not the least of which was the rate environment, which was very helpful to revenue in 2018, and not one that we would expect to repeat itself in 2019. Also, we conducted a pretty broad organizational redesign in the second half of 2017, and we were able to fully realize the benefits of that in 2018. ","So, those are two elements that won\u2019t repeat themselves in 2019. That said, we have a host of ongoing efficiency improvements that are constantly underway, and so in any given year the pace of improvement is going to vary year-to-year and it really depends on the investment opportunities we have, and the economic environment that presents itself and we're going to make trade-off inside of a year. And I think, you would expect to see us do that, you would want us to do that, not sacrifice long term growth for short-term efficiency gains. ","All that being said, continuous improvement as Bill said, is really built into our culture. It is hardwired into everything we do now in terms of our strategic planning, our short-term and our long-term planning. It\u2019s built into our incentive compensation. Our incentive comp is tied to year-over-year efficiency ratio improvements at every level in the company. So, the pace of improvement won't be 150-basis points this year, but we\u2019re committed to continuous improvement hence the medium-term target of 56% to 58%.","Saul Martinez","Okay, got it. I guess a related, more specific follow-up, this quarter, you obviously had the 60 million to pension settlement charges, you flagged a few other discrete items, could you remind us what those were this quarter and how much they were and what the magnitude of those discrete items were in the fourth quarter?","Allison Dukes","The only discrete item in the fourth quarter that was of any real magnitude was the $60 million in CF pension termination. There were some discrete tax items, a lot of puts and takes as I mentioned. Nothing of real significance and then generally all offset each other.","Saul Martinez","Okay. So, it\u2019s really just the 60. Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Amanda Larsen","Hi. This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Can you talk about the expectation for medium-term efficiency [indiscernible] 56% to 58% range, where do you expect that improvement to come from by segment and what are those targets within the firm-wide view?","Bill Rogers","If the question was sort of what is medium-term, I think we view medium-term as 3 to 4 years. And then where it will come from is a lot of different things. I think as we\u2019ve talked about before, we have strict targets for efficiency and virtually all of our businesses and it will come from all the things we\u2019ve been working on, leveraging technology investments, robotic process automation, cloud computing, getting more benefits from the loan origination systems and mortgage, and wholesale, digital, all end-to-end, agile mindset, third-party leverage, which we achieved this year, continued migration down of our real estate footprint, maximizing all the skills that we have in our overall chassis. So, it\u2019s a lot of things, it\u2019s not one thing and it\u2019s not centered in one business. You saw in this case improvements in wholesale and consumer and we\u2019d expect them both to continue to improve.","Amanda Larsen","Okay, great. And then separately, can you please talk about pipelines and expectations for growth in capital markets on 2019 by product group and also CRE banking?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I think pipelines are strong. They continue to be strong. They were good coming into the third quarter. They are good coming into the fourth quarter. They are strong coming into the first quarter. It appears that as of today, the markets are starting to respond, and we\u2019re responding accordingly with opportunity. That expect capital markets to grow. If you look at sort of the individual segment lines, M&A continues to be strong. I think that will have good growth characteristics in 2019, obviously that\u2019s lumpy by any one quarter. I think our syndication leverage finance will continue to be a strong part of what we do. The derivative business has continued to be strong. ","Trading will bounce back. It\u2019s not a big item, but it will bounce back from where it was in the third quarter. And our equity business, I think as those markets start to fall, probably later in the quarter and later in the year, we continue to think those will be strong parts of what we did. And then as Allison and I both mentioned, just the core underpinning of our non-CIB clients and our ability to be really relevant for those clients as they think about the future and the structures of their accompanying if that\u2019s going to continue to be an increasing part of what we do in capital markets.","Allison Dukes","And I think you asked about CRE at the end there as well, and we expect CRE growth to continue to be good in 2019. As noted, we are no longer tied just to construction fundings and with the addition of our permanent financing products and the ability to really participate in the life cycle of projects we can now expect CRE balances to maintain through the year and we see good growth in our pipelines there.","Amanda Larsen","Alright. Thank you.","Operator","And we will go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","More on the efficiency, just want to recognize seven years of better efficiency, the efficiency ratio went from 72% to 60% under your time Bill, and you got your efficiency target a year earlier, so all noted.","Bill Rogers","I feel like there is a but coming.","Mike Mayo","But you only now got to your targets in the 1985 merger [indiscernible], but look, I mean you\u2019ve made a lot of progress, but three to four years for your next efficiency target just feels far off, so a two-part question. One is, you talked about the trade-off between revenues and expenses, it seems like you are shifting some. So, is the emphasis now on generating more revenues at lower marginal cost, as you said, your goal is \u2013 efficiency is a means to an end and the end is returns and growth? And second, what are the gaps at SunTrust to best-in-class?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think first of all Mike in terms of setting the medium-term target, I think given our business mix, I think this is aspirational and it\u2019s all assumed to be organic. So, this has no dilutive impact into it. This is all organic improvement in our efficiency and not rate dependent. So, we sort of said, let us take a lot of those factors out of it in terms of we think of a medium. And the trade-off really isn't so much around revenue. I mean, clearly, we\u2019re making sure that we\u2019re investing the revenue, the trade-off is more long-term making sure that we\u2019ve got the right technology and the right forethought to make sure that we\u2019re long-term thinking about what clients need.","So, we\u2019re constantly making that trade-off. So, I\u2019m probably more proud of the investments we\u2019ve made in technology than I am in the efficiency that we have achieved. So, we have been balancing those continuously. So, that medium-term target I think toggles both of those effectively. I can assure you that the culture of continuous improvement, daily grind on all the things related to efficiency are there. I don't know that I see, you asked what\u2019s the sort of a big gap or the place of SunTrust. I don't think it\u2019s one particular thing. I mean, our business model I think, given the way we\u2019re structured, you know we\u2019re not going to be a low 50s efficiency ratio company that\u2019s not our business model. So, I think it\u2019s just continuing to do the things we\u2019re doing blocking and tackling, investing long-term and taking advantage of things that we\u2019ve already invested in.","Mike Mayo","One follow-up then, again, efficiency is a means to an end, you mentioned returns and growth. Any thoughts about where you\u2019d like the returns to be, they are certainly higher now?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I mean they are higher now. I mean, if we think about as we talk about sort of the returns on the asset liability part of the balance sheet, we have an extreme discipline around what comes on our balance sheet, what we expect from our teams to deliver in overall returns in meeting client needs. You know the last seven years that discipline continues to increase and I think is very cute. If we look at sort of total ROA and total ROTCE, I mean, clearly, we\u2019re at a pretty high point just relative to where we\u2019re in the credit cycle. So, we're going to be pushing as far as we can push. We\u2019re going to be focus on the returns, but over time, pick your timeline the credit part of that will normalize.","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Bill Rogers","Thanks Mike.","Operator","We'll go to John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead.","John Pancari","Morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Want to see if you can just give us a little bit more color on the operating losses, you mentioned the legal and fraud-related cost is a pretty big increase to the quarter. So, what is actually behind the, I know on the legal side I\u2019d be able to specifically talk about it, but on the fraud-related, is there something that\u2019s impacting that and cannot continue? Thanks.","Allison Dukes","Yes, John. There\u2019s no one particular thing there. You're going to see variability quarter-to-quarter, but nothing specific to point out necessarily. I don't think, I don't expect to see operating losses in the first quarter at this kind of $40 million level. Same time, I don't know that they\u2019ll be as low as the $20 million or so what we were running in the first half of last year. So, there\u2019s going to be some variability quarter-to-quarter, and just given our business model and some of the puts and takes there something between 20 million, 40 million probably a reasonable expectation, but you should expect variability.","John Pancari","Okay. Alright. And then also on the expense side, I heard your answer Bill regarding your efficiency ratio outlook, but when you look at it versus where your peers are, it still implies that you're operating and you expect to operate at a higher efficiency ratio then a good number of your larger super regional peers, are you saying you structurally believe that that will always be the case?","Bill Rogers","Well let's go back to ours is organic. So, this is, on organic growth, given our business model, we look at every line of business and we look at where it can produce both growth, return, and efficiency. And we try to target all those in terms of the being top quartile, then add all those up relative to how our company looks. We got to try to balance all those together. And some will have different emphasis relative to that piece. So, I think the 56 to 58, as we sit here is structurally is an appropriately ambitious goal that allows us to continue to invest in continue to grow.","John Pancari","Okay. Alright. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Wanted to ask you a little bit about this loan growth and then kind of a that to the liquidity coverage ratio? As we\u2019ve had the regulatory threshold where you are still below, I think you're getting some relief from the liquidity coverage ratio and the way it was calculated, wanted to make sure that as we\u2019re pushing towards 100% loan to deposit ratio just want to have a better feel for how you manage the liquidity coverage ratio and how you think about that?","Allison Dukes","Yes. On the LCR, if we do get some relief there at the margins, it gives us a little bit of an opportunity, it\u2019s not significant and it\u2019s not going to significantly change the way we manage our balance sheet or the way we think about loan growth. It does give us, again benefit of the margin, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we still have our own internal liquidity standard and those are always going to dominate how we think about the balance sheet.","Marty Mosby","And then when you look at the commercial real estate, you\u2019ve been as a concentration, there has been product that you\u2019ve avoided or just have not had as much as many other super regional banks is creating a lot of the momentum that you have no, how do you think about as a percent of your loan portfolio where that kind of gets too and how you think about that from a credit quality concentration risk?","Bill Rogers","Yes, Marty as you noted it has been a smaller relative part of our portfolio. I don't think it\u2019s going to have abnormal growth. I mean, we\u2019re not sort of leaning into headwinds. Part of what we\u2019ve seen today in the offset of what the run of is in construction, in 2017 we put up permanent financing product in place that really just allows us to be with stabilized high-quality loan to values that are actually lower, so better. And 60% plus of that is refinancing our existing portfolio. So, these are clients we know, projects we understand, we finance, they\u2019re highly stabilized and we\u2019re doing them at lower loan-to-value.","So, in many ways we\u2019re improving the credit quality of the portfolio. And then the other is, agency bridge product and that \u2013 the acquisition of Pillar and our knowledge about what is agency eligible allows us to really work with existing multi-family that\u2019s going through some type of rehab or ownership change and we do all that to underwrite the agency eligible position.","So, it\u2019s really in a strong position. The other part of the growth is a really, I think reflected in just what\u2019s happening in our core markets. I mean, we\u2019ve got some build to suit offers for regional and national headquarters that are moving to our business. So \u2013 and then on the other side, construction is down pretty significantly. So, I don't think CRE is going to be an abnormal part of our growth prospect, it\u2019s that our strategies are working, and our overall credit experience currently and what we\u2019re putting on the books, we feel really good about.","Allison Dukes","And I\u2019d just add, our CRE strategy is relationship-based. So, participating in the full life-cycle of the projects allows us to grow full relationships with these clients, which actually helps feel capital market activity like derivatives, as well as deposit growth. So, it\u2019s not just a product, it\u2019s really a relationship driven business overall.","Marty Mosby","And those are relationships you\u2019ve already had, which was a nice leveraging point that you can really use that you just kind of left on the table in the past.","Bill Rogers","I think that\u2019s a good way to say it.","Marty Mosby","The last thing is on efficiency. I don't want to take a whole another take because comparing to 20 years ago and the goal, it just isn't going to \u2013 it doesn't work because this is a totally different environment when you talk about compliance and the things that you require to do, I want to really look at it from a sense of, I know how hard it is to generate these efficiency gains, you got there a year early. What actually worked better, was it just revenues or were there other things that you got into and those projects got to be a little bit more productive, a lot faster?","Bill Rogers","You know it\u2019s a combination of both Marty. The revenue environment both in terms of return discipline and on executional excellence probably exceeded our expectations several years ago. So, our ability to acquire, retain, and expand relationships continues to perform at a higher, higher level and it has got more discipline around it. And then on the efficiency side, I wouldn't say it was one thing. I mean, clearly early the credit environment changed and we were able to take advantage of that, but it\u2019s dozens of things. It\u2019s opportunities that we see in terms of streamlining the chassis, probably the opportunity in technology were better than we thought they were five years ago or we didn\u2019t know what they were five years ago. So, we've been able to take advantage of those.","Marty Mosby","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Allison Dukes","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","Question on credit quality. I know the numbers are small, but if we look at the losses in the other direct book, year-over-year I guess, to counter the seasonality, they ticked up a little bit. Again, the dollars were small. But is that just seasoning? And then the follow-up question would just be, how are you feeling about the online lending platforms given some of the concerns about being late cycle and just this has been kind of a hot area and somewhat untested in downturns? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yes. To the first question it\u2019s a little more seasonal. So that \u2013 you see that pop, so that's not anything in seasonality. So that's not anything. It seasoned even in seasonal, I should say it that way, may be to get them both out there. So, that\u2019s not something that we\u2019re \u2013 have a particular concern about it at this point. If we look at the online channels and the partnership channels, we now have a chance that that book has got some good turns in it. So, I think it\u2019s time tested and what we\u2019re putting on is a high quality, 70 plus in life stream, 750 plus in GreenSky.","Our loss experience has been a low, our 30-plus day experience has been low. Fraud losses have been almost nothing. So, we feel good about that portfolio. We continue to stay at the high-end of the respect from there and that\u2019s not going to change dramatically. And as I said before, it\u2019s had a chance to have a couple of turn. So, we\u2019ve had several add backs on the learning of that portfolio.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, thank you.","Bill Rogers ","Thanks.","Ankur Vyas","Stacy, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll go to Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Allison, you mentioned, I think, the LightStream originations last year were just over $2 million, what percentage do they represent of the consumer originations in 2018, excluding mortgages from that number?","Allison Dukes","Want to think about \u2013 percentage of originations in 2018, I don't...","Bill Rogers","Let\u2019s think about that.","GerardCassidy","Okay. We can get back to that. Maybe, Bill, kind of question on consolidation, if I wanted to just build the background for you on the question. Obviously, the industry has had a great run here, four years of consecutive record profitability if we adjust last year's numbers for the tax changes, credit quality has been spectacular. Funding, low cost, core deposits have been great until very recently, now we're starting to see some issues there, digital banking making massive inroads. At what point is there an environment that you would consider that because maybe things start to become less good that it makes sense to join forces with another large regional bank?","Bill Rogers","Well, you know we're not going to speculate on any of that. I would say, for SunTrust we just continue to see a lot of opportunity within our own business.","Allison Dukes","And Gerard the answer to your question on LightStream originations as a percent of consumer origination ex mortgage, it was about 25% in 2018.","GerardCassidy","Appreciate that.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now line to turn the conference over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you Cynthia. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during the call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I am going to turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I will conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis and how this strategy is enhanced by our recent organizational changes.","We reported $0.91 of our earnings per share this quarter, which after excluding $0.04 of tax-related benefits was up 4% compared to the prior year. At a high level, the financial performance we delivered this quarter is a direct result of investing in ourselves to strengthen our client franchise and create a business mix that delivers consistent results in different macroeconomic environments. This has been and will continue to be a key driver of our success.","More specifically, this quarter we had yet another record for investment banking income. Our investments in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and the broader wholesale banking platform continued to deliver results and it's clear that our teammates are becoming increasingly effective at working together to deliver the breadth of our capabilities to new and existing clients. Additionally, mortgage servicing, a business we grew deliberately over the past several years, was up $33 million sequentially, which more than offset the decline in mortgage production. Further, our recent acquisition of Pillar provided us approximately $20 million of incremental revenue complementing our traditional CRE lending business.","And lastly, our ongoing investments in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are delivering profitable growth. These growth initiatives coupled with benefits from an improved interest rate environment and our focus on optimizing the balance sheet drove a 3% sequential and a 7% year-over-year increase in revenue.","As anticipated, expenses increased sequentially, driven primarily by a seasonal uptick in employee benefits related cost. In addition, we are making further investments in technology throughout the company to improve the client experience and drive future efficiency. As a result, our tangible efficiency ratio increased from the fourth quarter to 64.6% but was slightly better than our own expectations and we fully expect to achieve the efficiency ratio target we set for ourselves this year.","Overall, asset quality remained strong, stable and well within our guidance. Energy related losses declined further, which drove the reduction in the net charge-offs and non-performing loans. We continue to maintain underwriting discipline across the company in addition to ensuring a consistent focus on portfolio diversity, both of which will result in further capital efficiency from a strong starting point of 9.5% Common Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis.","So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Aleem who is going to provide some more details on this quarter's performance.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks Bill and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. I will start on slide four and cover our net interest margin, which increased nine basis points as a result of the steeper yield curve, which positively impacted the securities portfolio and mortgage yields and the increase in contractual short-term rates. The typical first quarter day count effect also positively contributed three basis points to the sequential improvement in margin.","Net interest income increased 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year as a result of higher rate balance sheet growth and our continued focus on optimizing loan mix. Looking to the second quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase by a further one to two basis points. This is lower than the first quarter increase as the benefits from lower premium amortization expense and day counts will not repeat. We will continue to manage through a moderately asset sensitive balance sheet while being cognizant of opportunities to add duration if the yield curve steepens.","Moving on the slide five. You will see that non-interest income increased 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Investment banking had another record quarter and was up $45 million sequentially and $69 million year-over-year as our wholesale banking teammates did an outstanding job in helping clients capitalize upon strong market conditions. Growth was broad based across the entire CIB platform, though particularly strong in syndicated finance and M&A. As Bill mentioned earlier, the consistent growth of our CIB business is a reflection of both the investments we have been making for many years and the one team approach that wholesale delivering to our clients.","Mortgage related income increased by $8 million sequentially as the anticipated declines in production income were more than offset by a $33 million increase in servicing income, which benefited from lower decay expense and recent portfolio acquisitions. As you saw this quarter, our strategic growth of the servicing portfolio, which is up 16% over the last two years, has diversified our revenue mix and resulted in a more balanced mortgage business.","Lastly, I note that we have introduced a new line item in the income statement for commercial real estate related income, which is comprised of the fee income from Pillar & Cohen Financial, SunTrust Community Capital and Structured Real Estate, the latter two of which were previously recorded in other non-interest income. Pillar's integration into SunTrust is going very well and the driver of the sequential decline is simply due to the normal variability of SunTrust Community Capital where activity is typically higher in the fourth quarter.","Let's take a look at expenses on slide six. Non-interest expense increased $68 million this quarter, driven entirely by a $90 million increase in personnel expense as a result of the typical seasonal increases in FICA and 401k costs in addition to the acquisition of Pillar. We also recorded $19 million of costs related to ongoing efficiency initiatives in other non-interest expense, which is about $10 million higher than normal. These increases were partially offset by declines in most other expense categories particularly markets","Compared to the prior year, our expense base grew 11% as a result of four primary factors. Our improved business and stock price performance, investments we continue to make in talent and technology, higher FDIC premiums and higher net occupancy costs as a result of lower amortized gains from prior sale leaseback transactions. As a reminder, both FDIC premium expense and occupancy costs stepped up in the third quarter of 2016 and have been generally stable since then.","Separately, while our higher stock price did result in elevated incentive costs in the first quarter compared to a year ago, it also resulted in a tax benefit. The benefit is the amount by which the tax deductions for stock-based compensation exceeded the book deduction. As you can imagine, RSUs that invested in Q1 had a large amount of appreciation over the book expense due to the significant increase in our stock price over the last six months. Previously, this benefit would have been recorded directly to equity, but new accounting standards require these adjustments to be recorded in the provision for income taxes. All else equal, I expect this quarter's expenses to be the high watermark for the year. For the remainder of 2017, the expense base will decline as a result of lower employee benefits costs in addition to our ongoing efficiency initiatives.","Moving to slide seven where you see the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 64.6% which is up relative to the fourth quarter given normal seasonal patterns in our business and as Bill noted is actually slightly better than our internal expectations. Given this combined with our positive revenue momentum and the ongoing efficiency initiatives we have underway, we remain on track to achieve our goals of having a tangible efficiency ratio of between 61% and 62% for this year and sub-60% by 2019.","Moving on to slide eight. Our asset quality metrics improved further this quarter evidenced by the six basis point decline in net charge-offs and four basis point decline in non-performing loans and as anticipated, the ALLL ratio was relatively stable. Overall, we continue to expect the net charge-off ratio to remain within a range of 30 to 40 basis points for the full year and for provision expense to approximate net charge-offs, although there will always be some quarterly variability.","Let's take a look at the balance sheet on slide nine. Average loans increased 1% sequentially, primarily due to growth in C&I and consumer. Period end loans were flat as declines in home equity and C&I were offset by the continued growth in consumer lending. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $5.2 billion or 4% with growth across most categories. In particular, our targeted investments in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are driving solid loan growth and also improving our return profile as the weighted average yield of our consumer portfolio is obviously higher than our commercial portfolio.","Bigger picture, our clients are optimistic as evidenced by the results of SunTrust's recent Business Pulse Survey where 75% of our clients feel their own outlook is strong and many cite tax reform, infrastructure spending and reduced regulatory burden as catalysts for economic growth and their momentum. As clarity on these fronts develops, we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are extremely well positioned to meet their needs, given the investments we have made in our business combined with our presence in the higher growth Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets.","Turning to deposits on slide 10. Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across most products and businesses. Our successful deposit growth strategy is the result of our commitment to meeting more of our clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and ultimately our teammates in both the consumer and wholesale banking segments. Deposit betas remain low, which is a reflection of the relatively low interest rate environment and our strong retail deposit mix. Over time, deposit betas will normalize though we will continue to keep our consistent focus on maximizing the value proposition for our clients outside of rate pay.","Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 9.5%, up about 10 basis points from the prior quarter, even after we successfully returned some of our excess capital to our owners in the form of our normal $240 million quarterly buyback combined in Q1 with an incremental $174 million share repurchase. We submitted our 2017 capital plan earlier this month and look forward to sharing our results with you in late June. At a high level, our strong capital position, particularly in the context of our risk profile combined with additional capital stack optimization should allow us to continue to increase payouts to our owners.","Moving to the segment overviews, let's begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on slide 12 where we are seeing solid revenue momentum. This has been largely driven by net interest income, which was up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth and further balance sheet optimization. We continue to make good progress in our consumer lending businesses as the direct result of investments to improve our capabilities and enhance the client experience. Consumer loan balances excluding home equity are up 16% year-over-year, which is meaningful in both the context of the company's overall growth trajectory and our return profile. Strong deposit growth continues to be another key contributor to CPWM's revenue momentum with average balances up 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year.","Our ability to grow deposits, while reducing the size of our branch network, which is down 6% year-over-year is a testament to both the strength of our franchise and our clients' continued evolution toward a digitally centered banking experience. We are aware of the importance of having a differentiated and integrated client experience across traditional and digital channels and have consequently made significant investments in each of these areas. In fact, this quarter, we introduced a new and improved mobile banking app and enhanced our online banking platform in order to increase its connectivity to our mortgage offering. In addition, we introduced a digital conversation guide for our branch teammates to help them better track and meet client needs.","Non-interest income declined 4% sequentially as a result of seasonal declines in service charges and card fees. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income was down 2% due entirely to the posting order changes implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016.","In wealth management, we continue to make a strategic shift from more of a transaction oriented business to providing management solutions for our clients. This has had a negative impact on recent retail investment income growth trends, but provides for better long-term growth and stability for our clients and our business. Consequently, wealth management related income was stable, both sequentially and year-over-year as growth in AUM was offset by the implications of this shift.","Expenses in CPWM increased 8% compared to the prior year, largely as a result of the investments we have been making in our digital and consumer lending capabilities, higher FDIC and occupancy costs and increased costs and charges related to branch closures. At a high level, we are pleased with the momentum across CPWM. Consumer lending is producing consistently strong growth. Deposits continue to grow meaningfully. Private wealth management is demonstrating better momentum. And our investments in an improved client experience and more effective branch network will further strengthen our franchise.","As you see on slide 13, wholesale banking delivered record revenue, in part due to strong capital markets conditions but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we are having with our clients. Revenues were up 6% sequentially and 16% year-over-year primarily due to investment banking's record performance. Growth in investment banking was broad based across most product and client segments, a great indicator that our teammates across the platform are gaining further traction and expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital markets needs of all wholesale banking clients.","More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter. Another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic advisor. Syndicated finance also had a record quarter. While strong market conditions were a key driver, we also saw continued growth in our commercial and CRE client segments, which contributed to roughly a quarter of a sequential increase. Total lead left relationships are up 9% year-over-year and our average fee per transaction continues to increase. Both of these are direct reflections of our success in strengthening client relationships.","Net interest income was also a key contributor to the strong revenue growth, up 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as a result of improved loan yields and continued deposit growth. Non-interest expense was up 17% compared to the prior year as a result of higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth and our higher stock price, ongoing investments in technology and the acquisition of Pillar. Pillar's financial contribution in the first quarter was very much in line with our expectations with approximately $20 million of revenue and efficiency ratio in the 80s and an ROA that was accretive to the rest of the company. Pillar, combined with our recent introduction of a longer-term financing product continues to enhance the capabilities of our CRE business.","Overall, our value proposition in the wholesale banking business is clear. We deliver a full suite of product capabilities and industry expertise with a one team approach to middle market and mid-corporate clients. This value proposition continues to resonate with our clients and the momentum across the wholesale business remains strong.","Moving the slide 14. We benefited from our diverse revenue mix within the mortgage segment this quarter as the anticipated decline in production income was offset by higher servicing income. Production income was down sequentially and year-over-year as a result of lower refinance activity, though purchase activity remains strong with applications up 26% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. Servicing income increased $33 million sequentially, driven by lower decay expense and a larger servicing portfolio. Net income was up $4 million sequentially, driven by higher servicing income. Compared to the prior year, net income was down $21 million as a result of lower revenue and a larger reserve release last year.","To conclude, let me remind you that we previously announced our strategic decision to integrate our mortgage business with the broader consumer segment and thus mortgage financials will be incorporated into a consolidated consumer segments slide within the July earnings presentation. We will continue to report residential mortgage production income and servicing income as components of non-interest income in the consolidated financials.","So with that, let me turn it over back to Bill for some concluding remarks.","Bill Rogers","Okay. Thanks Aleem. So to conclude, I want to point to slide 15 which highlights how this quarter's performance aligned with our overall investment thesis. So first, we have made targeted investments in growing our client businesses and diversifying our revenue mix over the last several years. These investments coupled with the improving interest rate environment helped drive strong 7% year-over-year revenue growth. A little more specifically our investments in consumer lending helped offset lower growth in other areas while also enhancing returns, consumer private wealth and wholesale delivered strong 6% and 7% year-over-year deposit growth respectively as a result of our focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payments needs and our 10-year plus investments in talent and capabilities across SunTrust Robinson Humphrey continue to lead to deeper client relationships and significant revenue growth.","In addition, we have made and continue to make meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. In the first quarter specifically, we enhanced our consumer digital capabilities, added small business banking to our new wholesale loan origination platform, upgraded our treasury management mobile capabilities and began to conduct test of robotic process automation across mortgage and wholesale lending.","While these investments have the potential to create further efficiencies, they are first and foremost about delivering improved client experience with strong executional excellence. Going forward, our opportunity set is significant and we will make further investments in enhancing the client experience. As Aleem noted earlier, effective April 3, we integrated our mortgage segment with consumer banking and private wealth management to create a new consumer segment under Mark Chancy's leadership. Mark and the team already have significant momentum on which to build and we expect to create a more consistent integrated and improved experience for our clients across all consumer products and services, somewhat akin to the integrated ecosystem Mark and his leadership teams developed in our wholesale banking business.","Hugh Cummins will succeed Mark as the leader for wholesale, both most recently led the commercial and business banking line of business and previously led SunTrust Robinson Humphrey from 2008 to 2013. He has been a key contributor to the momentum that SunTrust has established in wholesale and I have no doubt that he and his team will not miss a beat in delivering the distinct value proposition they have spent over a decade in building.","Second, we have demonstrated consistent efficiency improvements and have plans to accomplish even more. Tom Freeman is now the Efficiency & Strategic Partnerships Executive allowing us to provide more executive focus on large scale efficiency opportunities in addition to evaluating further FinTech alliances and growth opportunities. Tom's focus here gives more confidence in our ability to achieve both our short-term and long-term efficiency objectives.","Lastly, our capital position remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.5%. This is even more notable when juxtaposed against our risk profile where SunTrust demonstrates amongst the lowest levels of capital erosion in severely adverse economic scenarios relative to peer banks. This strong risk-adjusted capital position gave us confidence to repurchase a total of $414 million of common shares in the first quarter in addition to submitting a capital plan that would result in further increased payouts and financial confidence to you, our owners.","So before we conclude, I would be remiss not to mention that SunTrust Park, the new home of the Atlanta Braves opened last weekend. This is the start of a 25-year partnership and we are already thrilled with the brand exposure it offers, both regionally and nationally. But this is much more than a name in a ball park. This investment allows our bank to reach more people and fulfill our purpose of lighting the way to financial wellbeing through programs that we will activate as well as SunTrust Onsite Center called The onUp Experience. There we will engage fans to learn more about gaining financial confidence with fun and interactive baseball activities while also strengthen our brand as a purpose driven client-first company.","So with that, I will now turn it back over to Ankur and we will begin the Q&A portion.","Ankur Vyas","Cynthia, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I would like to ask all participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and only one follow-up in order that we can accommodate as many of you as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ryan Nash","Hi. Good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Bill, maybe I will just start with expenses. You noted that they are going to decline from this quarter. So I just want to make sure I got the guidance right. Will they decline each subsequent quarter? And then I guess related to that, I think the presentation noted that you are going to be closing another 3% of branches this quarter. Should we expect to see similar repositioning costs in the second quarter? And is that baked into your expense guidance?","Bill Rogers","Yes. Ryan, first let me say and you know, as Aleem said, we sort of start with thinking about efficiency ratio on a year-over-year basis versus a quarter-to-quarter basis. So while we were up in the first quarter and overall, some of that element was due to expenses supporting our revenue growth and then some was episodic and idiosyncratic to FDIC posting order, stock price appreciation, Pillar, a lot of things that Aleem's already referred to as well as our core tenet to continue to invest in our strategic platform.","But as Aleem said, what we said is as it relates to this quarter, that's the high watermark for both dollars and percent for this year, I mean bar anything that we can't anticipate. And whether it's a quarter-to-quarter, we will have some fluctuations. Some of that will be dependent upon revenue. I don't anticipate a lot more on the branch side. We have sort of done the, as you noted, we have got the 3%. We took most of the cost related to that in the first quarter.","I don't anticipate an additional charge related to branch closures and the additional plan that we have. And so factoring all of that in, including the rate hikes, we are ahead of where we thought we were. So if we look at our own planning, right now although the number seems higher, we are ahead of where we thought we were and our confidence in getting to that 61% to 62% is very strong.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then maybe if I can ask one to Aleem. Aleem, maybe if you could just talk about what's built into the net interest margin in terms of further rate hikes? I think you had said last quarter, June and December. So how should we think about the margin for the remainder of 2017 if the forward curve proves to be correct?","Aleem Gillani","All right. Yes. We had originally been thinking that rate increases for 2017 would be due in December given the March increase. We think that's a little bit of a pull forward and maybe June and December now looks something like March and September. So that will help a little bit on a full-year basis. As we said for Q2, we do expect we will get another one or two basis points in NIM in addition to the 9% that we delivered in Q1. And if I try to look sort of full year overall, we then participated one more anticipated rate hike later this year. You know we are normally conservative in the way we think about rate hikes, but we are including that one in. If I think about the full year NIM, what that's going to look like, right now we are thinking that will kind of average probably something like 3.10% or so full year.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning. Aleem, just a follow-up on the NIM comments there. Could you just remind us, you mentioned deposit betas remain low, what exactly are you seeing in terms of deposit betas on the retail and commercial? And what kind of beta is baked into your rate sensitivity disclosures when you look ahead?","Aleem Gillani","What we incorporate in our modeling, when you take a look at our asset sensitivity that you see in the release what we normally incorporate in our modeling there is kind of a full through the cycle beta so that long-term investors get a good sense of what that's going to look like over the long term. And what we are thinking there pull through the cycle is about a 50 or so beta full company full cycle. Obviously, we have been able to hold the line on liability costs so far and provide our clients with a value proposition that they see from us that's not just based on rate. The differentiation between business clients and consumer clients is apparent.","Business clients, as you can imagine, with large dollars to deposit are normally more sensitive on betas that are a little bit higher. As I look forward to the rest of the year, it wouldn't surprise me if we saw overall betas for the company in that kind of 25 or so range for the remainder of this year and climbing through 18 to 19 If we get something that looks like the forward curve and if we get sort of measured pace of rate increases from the Fed. All of this is dependent on timing of rate hikes, the competitive environment, obviously and to some extent the steepness of the curve.","John McDonald","Okay. Great. And as a follow-up, just on the loan growth side. You posted some good C&I growth in a tough quarter for the industry. What are you seeing in terms of the C&I loan demand dynamics? And where does SunTrust see opportunities to grow loans this year, even if the industry trends remain sluggish?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I will take that. I think the good news is that it's highly diversified. So I can't point to one area and say this was a particular area that accounted for the high percentage of the growth. It's really related to all the investments we have made and the strategies that we have put in place and I think directly correlated to what you see on the fee based side because that's also evidence of the advice that we are giving clients. And I think that results in stronger asset growth. As you know, we don't manage to loan outstandings as a benchmark. We look at production. We look at paydowns, utilization and pipelines and there's some ups and downs related to all that, but all of that put together keeps us being fairly optimistic about where we can go.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. John, as I said in my comments, the SunTrust Business Pulse Survey that we did with our business clients came back with very positive results with many of our clients, 75% feeling really positive about their business. And just yesterday, we received the results of our CRE survey where we surveyed 200 CEOs of CRE clients and that was also very positive with many of them thinking that given the message that they are hearing from DC and then expectations that the administration will be able to deliver on some of those promises, that their growth prospects in 2017, 2018 and 2019 look very good.","Bill Rogers","All that being said, we have to reflect on, there is still a bit of a wait and see out there and I don't think that's illogical whether it's tax or healthcare regulation reform. And you saw the market react pretty quickly to some comments related to tax reform. So I think there's still a little bit of wait and see out there and we will look to the next quarters as it relates to a potential inflection point.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi Matt.","Aleem Gillani","Hi Matt.","Matt O'Connor","I was hoping to drill down on the expenses a little bit. I think you said on an absolute basis it will decline from here through the rest of the year and just wanted to get a little more color in terms of the drivers of that? And then specifically, it seems like the cost might have been a little inflated within the consumer segment this quarter, not only the branch cost that you called out, but maybe some other stuff as well. So just trying to get a little more clarity on the cost overall and then specifically on the consumer side of things.","Aleem Gillani","Well, Matt, the Q1 is typically the high watermark for us anyway. So the primary reason for that in Q1 is employee benefits cost, FICA and 401k. And the majority of the decline therefore from Q1 is actually going to be that bump up in benefits cost going away. Having said that, as you pointed out, there will be other costs that I think will be removed over the course of the year.","We have several efficiency initiatives that are underway. As Bill said, the effect of branch closure cost has primarily been taken early. They are still going to be a couple million here and there over the course of the year but nothing as significant as we saw in the first quarter.","And some of our other efficiency initiatives are in the space of third-party management vendor costs. We have got some work going on in the area of telecommunications costs. So we expect that as those initiatives come to fruition over the course of the year that a lot of those costs will disappear.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just any comment on full year expenses? I know you have given us this efficiency ratio, but as you think on an absolute basis, cost decline from here? Any sense on what they might look like on a full year basis?","Bill Rogers","For full-year basis, we are very focused on the efficiency of the company. And we are happy to be able to note five straight years of improved efficiency at SunTrust. And looking forward for the remainder of 2017, I fully expect that at the end of this year we will have a sixth straight year of efficiency improvement.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. All right. It's very clear. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is helping.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","Bill Rogers","Good morning Geoff.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. The continued growth in indirect, I am guessing, driven by auto. And kind of curious there, is there an opportunity opening up as some of the other banks pull back?","Aleem Gillani","I think if you are looking at year-over-year growth, Geoff, it's a little bit deceiving because of the base from last year. You will recall that what we have been doing with indirect over the last several years is when we see opportunities to manage our overall asset base, we have been a regular seller or securitizer of non-core or low ROA indirect auto loans. And in 3Q last year, we securitized $1 billion. So after that decline in 3Q, if you are looking at year-over-year numbers, naturally you will see growth as a result of that sale. But having said that, when we take a look at our indirect auto right now at the end of Q1, I am pleased actually that our overall weighted average FICO for indirect auto loans is slightly up and our overall LTV on indirect auto loans are slightly down. So if I look at the quality of our indirect auto book, I think right now it's actually pretty good.","Bill Rogers","Yes. And maybe just to embellish that is, we are not leaning in on indirect. There are places where we are very specifically leaning in on consumer lending and commercial and other areas. And what we are doing with indirect is making sure that supports our overall businesses. And we play in that prime to superprime area as a Aleem noted. So we see it as just a good continuation of our strategy.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then just following up on auto. I know within LightStream, you have got a pretty significant contribution from auto, most of it unsecured. Can you give us a bit more detail on the nature of the products and the size of the opportunity there?","Bill Rogers","The nature of the products in LightStream, yes. They are made up of a number of different types of loans.","Geoffrey Elliott","Unsecured auto, I guess is what I wanted to focus on.","Bill Rogers","It is. Yes. So we have got unsecured auto there. We also have secured auto and other types of products that we have got on LightStream are unsecured and secured non-auto loans and then we also have debt consolidation loans. So across the board, looking at the composition, I don't have in my head exactly how much is auto versus non-auto, but the total amount of the LightStream portfolio now, Geoff, is $3.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. The unsecured for auto is superprime part of the portfolio. Average FICO in LightStream is 770 something. It's a high prime, superprime product, particularly in that unsecured area. And overall portfolio yield north of five.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about credit which, as you mentioned, is in your ranges and you are not expecting to have to build a release much from here. But there was a credit out there that was pretty fairly public. I know you don't talk about singular credits out there, but just in the context of, did you see any lumpiness still in C&I, because I am noticing just a big decline in NPA still? And there just doesn't seem to be anything filling the bucket behind. So could you first just talk about any lumpiness that we are starting to see here on the C&I side, if at all?","Bill Rogers","Well, in C&I, obviously that book is lumpy by nature and so there is going to be some lumpiness as individual credits deteriorate over the course of the year. As you said, Ken, we don't reference clients by name, but you know us. We are pretty conservative and if we see credit deterioration in a name, we are going to react. So you can expect that if there is an action that we needed to have been taken in the first quarter, we would have taken it.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Well put. And then second, my follow-up just on, also on the consumer side, you have always pointed out that there is this nice lag between the residential delinquency and charge-offs on those debt side of the book. And so can you just talk a little bit about how much more extra benefit you might still have ahead on the resi side? And then just anything to note on the consumer side, just given some of the newer growth and seasoning there? Thanks guys.","Aleem Gillani","Yes. I think most of the benefit in resi, Ken, has come through. Over the last several years, the quality of both our home equity and mortgage books has been pristine and we have enjoyed the advantage of that type of really high quality origination. But most of the decline in reserves that had been built in previous years has been taken. If your question is leading to where we expect the allowance to go overall, I would think that the allowance ratio for the company would be generally pretty stable within a few basis points of where we are now. And you have seen that stability from us in the last few quarters. I would expect that to continue for the remainder of the year.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks Aleem.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning George.","Gerard Cassidy","I think it was back in 2014, you guys started a program for the capital markets part of your company to go after customers that were not CIB customers. Could you tell us, in this quarter what percentage of the business is coming from non-CIB? And how is that trending since you implemented that plan?","Aleem Gillani","I will tell you that we provide capital market services to all of our wholesale clients, including those in our commercial banking area and those in our CRE area. So we look at our clients kind of holistically and we approach them as one team with all of the products that they are going to need, whether those are loans or capital market services. If you look at our results this quarter in the context of over an industry loan growth that's not growing, you see that our capital markets business did particularly well and that's because we were able to provide both corporate and commercial clients with the capital market services they need. We don't really break down in detail externally how much of that comes from CRE and commercial clients, but if you want to think about at a high level, 15% to 20% of capital markets revenues come from commercial and CRE as well as private wealth clients in the context of the total.","Bill Rogers","Yes. I would say that overall strategy is a key part of our growth dynamic going forward. Quarter-to-quarter, it's going to fluctuate. So this quarter, a little down in commercial, but it was up in CRE, as an example. So just quarter-to-quarter it might fluctuate and year-over-year it's up substantially and at the numbers that Aleem was talking about.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. And then a bigger picture question. We all know the industry has changed dramatically in the last 20 years, more capital, higher efficiency ratios for yourselves as well as everybody else, which obviously means lower profitability and the ROE number of course is still below 10%, ROTC obviously is over 11% this quarter. The ROA though, it's interesting you guys are around 93 basis points. Where do you think that goes to the ROA now with the new, obviously you have got the LCR ratio which hurts the profitability, what's a normal ROA once we get into a normal interest rate environment maybe over the next two or three years for you guys?","Bill Rogers","Well, if you think back, George, you started your question with kind of where we are long term normalize before the crisis and long-term normalize before the crisis for SunTrust, it was uncommon for us at all to show ROA that were in the 110. And as I look forward from here, that kind of a number would be the kind of number that we would be targeting for the company given the business mix and our ability to deliver services to our client base today.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rose with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Michael Rose","Hi. Good morning. Maybe we could just start on CCAR and payout ratio. You guys have been around 30% dividend payout ratio. Is there any comfort at this point to move that higher? And then should we think about capital return approaching 100% move forward? Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning Michael. Thank you for the question. Yes. I think as we look at the guidance that the regulators have provided to the industry, one of the items of that they have noted for main street banks like us, is that the focus in CCAR this year will move to move a more quantitative approach and some of the constraints that had been placed on the industry have been moved toward those banks that require more tailored regulation and away from banks that have a more vanilla business model like us. So given the removal of some of those constraints, we would hope to be able to, on an overall basis, respond to the needs of our owners and change overall payouts and payout mix towards something that we think is more in the context of our long run payout ratios and mix and what they are asking for.","Michael Rose","Great. That's great color. And then just switching to credit. A lot of talk this quarter on strip centers. Can you just remind us of your exposure? And may be if you are still comfortable running into that asset class or if you have pulled back? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yes. Maybe I will take that and just do it in sort of the overall category of retail and staying thematically on inter and intra diversity which has sort of been a core component of our focus for the last five years. So it started sort of a big number, got a little over $5 billion, 3.5% of total loans that sort of fit into that category. Commercial real estate would be about $900 million of that and the mall component of that would be very, very small. REITs would be about $700 million of that. Again, the mall component of that smaller and the preponderance of all that investment grade. And then the all other sort of in about $3.6 billion is really diversified both by geography and by product type. So it's everything, grocery, gas station, drug stores, home and furniture. But again very, very broad based.","Michael Rose","Great, Thanks for taking my questions.","Bill Rogers","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning John.","John Pancari","On the expense side, the operating losses, I know that it was higher in the quarter. Could you just clarify again what drove that? And then separately on the efficiency ratio, I know you gave guidance for FY 2017 and you gave the longer-term guidance of below 60% by 2019. How do you think about 2018? If you could give us a little bit of color about how the efficiency ratio could look for the year for 2018? Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","All right. Well, I will talk about our operating losses first. Yes, it\u2019s a few million dollars higher this quarter. That actually relates to legal accrual that we took this quarter on a specific instance. So that's the context of the few million dollars. Efficiency ratio, John, what we try to do is we try to improve it every year. So in 2017, our intent is to get the somewhere between 61% and 62%. For 2019, our intent is to get below 60%. There are several people who just draw a straight line between those two. That's not our guidance but that's what several people do. And in the context of, we try to improve every year. We will try to improve in 2018 from 2017.","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then separately on the loan growth front, can just give us a little bit more detail on the decline on the end-of-period basis that you saw in overall commercial? And is that just some of the reluctance in the wait and see attitude that\u2019s showing up there? And how soon could we see a nice pick up there on C&I? And then did you actually quantify your utilization rate and what the actual pipeline did for the quarter?","Aleem Gillani","Let me try to hit some of those. I think, yes, the answer is, it's a little bit of a latency, but it's also a little bit of the capital markets. So those are related. So there was opportunity for clients to take advantage of capital markets and it was a good environment, good rate environment, good appetite and the good news is we benefit on that side of the equation, from that standpoint. As it relates to the utilization, it's just slightly up. So I think slightly is a really important thing. Utilization over the last five years has been pretty flat. So any quarter can be slightly up or slightly down. I think it's tricky to get too much of a read into that. Pipelines, if we look at sort of the early stage pipelines, they are really good. There's a lot of conversations. There's proactive desire to want to do some things. People have got from drawing board. If we look at later stage pipelines, they fall under that latency category. They are slightly down. So if we put all that into balance, I think it's consistent with everything we said.","Ankur Vyas","Cynthia, we can go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. And that will be from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning Erika.","Aleem Gillani","Hi Erika.","Erika Najarian","I just wondered, one question, just wanted to zoom out on the landscape for a bit. There seems to be bipartisan support to amend the official SIFI buffer to $250 billion and I wonder if with SunTrust's $204 billion assets, if that does get passed through Congress, does that change how you are thinking about inorganic growth versus organic growth opportunities?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I like to think about this is an efficient frontier and you sort of find out where you are on the efficient frontier. Today, we think we are in a great place on the efficient frontier. We are big enough to absorb all the costs that we need to do from a regulatory standpoint and also make the investments we need to make in our business. What we have talked about as sort of tailored regulation in contrast, so while there is some dialog around official levels, there is also a lot of dialog around risk based establishment of capital levels that wouldn't be dependent upon necessarily an asset level. So the net of all that, we will be in the athletic position to move to wherever the ball goes. And if $250 billion is a hard line, then we will look at our strategy as we are several years away from that. So we have got time and capacity to build to do the things that we need to do and we will adjust and define our strategies based on where they land. But right now, I think we are really in the perfect place. We have got a risk-based model that's a lower risk-based model and that we are at an asset size that allows us to really compete highly effectively and under any sort of threshold, I think we will be sort of under the thresholds versus over the thresholds.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","Cynthia, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And that will come from the line of Stephen Scouten with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Stephen Scouten","Hi guys. Thanks a lot. So I just wanted to follow up on some questions about credit. Any other areas that you are seeing any early signs of concern? I know we have seen some healthcare credits maybe show some weakness this quarter, especially on the syndicated side of things. Any changes that you guys are making to concentrations in certain areas?","Bill Rogers","Steve, we are actually very pleased with what we are seeing in the credit landscape right now. If we look across all of our businesses, our exposure to the clients that we would like to have, is just about perfect in the context of client mix, loan mix. And looking across, we are not seeing areas of weakness across anyone of the businesses in which we focus that would worry us to any material level at all. Now having said that, I might have just jinxed us. So I am knocking on the table right now. But right now, talking with our risk folks and our frontline folks, they are feeling really good about what they are hearing from clients and what they are seeing in the industry.","Aleem Gillani","But it also just undermines when times are good is when you plan the most and staying really committed to the diversity of our business model is critical. So if we do see one pocket whether it's one credit or one geography or one issue, we want to be in a position that, that doesn't impact our long-term objectives and opportunities.","Stephen Scouten","Okay. That's fantastic. And then just one follow-up on the loan growth. Do you guys still think you can grow kind of at the pace of one to two times GDP in the longer term? And maybe do we need a specific catalyst here in the near term to see something that more approximate that in the next couple quarters?","Aleem Gillani","Well, our ability to grow, I think at north of GDP is well proven. We have got the infrastructure. We have got the product base. We have got the teammate talent. We have got the client mix to be able to continue to do that. And I would fully expect that we will continue to be able to do that. Now of course that's not in any given quarter, there's going to be quarterly volatility. But as I look out sort of year-over-year or through the cycle, yes, I fully expect that we are going to be able to grow north of GDP even north of GDP in our footprint and our footprint has shown good ability to grow north of national GDP.","Stephen Scouten","Fantastic.

Welcome to the SunTrust First Quarter 2019 Earnings Results. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Linda. Good morning. And welcome to SunTrust first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially.","In addition, in connection with the proposed merger with BB&T, BB&T has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of BB&T\u2019s capital stock to be issued in connection with the merger, which contains a joint proxy statement and prospectus that will be sent to the shareholders of BB&T and SunTrust seeking their approval of the proposed transaction.","Please refer to the cautionary statements on page two of our presentation regarding forward-looking information, including some of the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially.

The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Ankur, and good morning. I am going to begin with an overview of the first quarter, which we highlight on slide four and we will then turn it over to Allison for some additional details. I will come back and conclude with some updates on the merger with BB&T and how our integration planning efforts are progressing.","Core earnings per share were $1.33 this quarter, which excludes $0.09 per share and merger related costs. Overall, we had a good quarter and our 3% year-over-year growth in earnings, excluding those costs, highlights the growth potential we have on a standalone basis. In addition, our future earnings potential will be amplified when we merged with BB&T.","With that said, let me highlight some of the specifics for SunTrust earnings in the first quarter. Loan growth remained strong, evidenced by a 3% sequential growth we delivered, which was generally broad-based across most businesses.","Investments we have made in our vice-driven model for corporate commercial and CRE clients, in addition to our ongoing investments in digital consumer lending continued to drive good loan growth and direct auto also had one of its strongest quarters, reflecting the pullback from certain competitors and strong consumer confidence.","It\u2019s clear that our clients remained optimistic about the economy and are committed to making ongoing investments, both personally and in their businesses. While loan growth outpaced deposit growth, our net interest margin remained stable this quarter as the benefit of the December rate hike helped to absorb some of the increased funding costs.","Non-interest income declined sequentially, driven primarily by seasonal trends in CRE fee income. Capital markets income did rebound somewhat this quarter, driven by trading, but we experienced some softness in equity and M&A consistent with industry trends.","While the overall investment banking environment remained somewhat choppy and uneven, our advice driven model, full set of product capabilities and industry expertise and focus on the middle market positions us well for long-term success.","Our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved by 130 basis points year-over-year, providing us good momentum headed into the merger and realizing our long-term potential with BB&T. And finally, credit quality remains a strength with charge-offs and NPLs both stable relative to the fourth quarter.","Importantly, our consistently low credit losses are reflection of our underwriting discipline in addition to an economy that\u2019s on solid footing. All-in-all, this quarter was a good start to the year for SunTrust and I remained optimistic about the investments we have made to drive a sustainable competitive advantage in our differentiated businesses and the strength of our balance sheet.","While it does appear that the rate environment will be less of a contributor to our earnings growth going forward, this is largely mitigated by our diversified business model, the ongoing investments we have made and continue to make in growth and technology, and our commitment to continuous improvement and efficiency, each of these factors give me confidence that 2019 will be a good year for SunTrust on a standalone basis and propel us into the next great chapter in our company\u2019s history.","Before I turn it over to Allison, I do want to mention that last Friday we filed an 8-K outlining the commitment of our SunTrust aimed to the new company. Allison has made a very personal decision to pursue opportunities in Atlanta during the next phase of her career. We considered all the options together and I am fully supportive of her decision.","Her leadership as CFO until closing will be critical and crucial to making this merger a great success. The time will come later to thank Allison and acknowledge that many extraordinary contributions she has made at SunTrust.","Importantly, together as a new team, we ask Mike McGuire to serve on the executive management team as Head of National Consumer Finance and Payments for the merged company. Mike\u2019s top talent in SunTrust and has significant experience in the financial, technology and payment space He\u2019s very well positioned to serve in this key role, leading the high growth opportunity for the new company.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Allison.","Allison Dukes","Thanks, Bill. I fully believe that this merger is the right transaction for our company and my broad family and personal commitments in Atlanta, I realized that the best decision for me is to remain in Atlanta. This is not an easy decision and I want to thank Bill for his tremendous support, friendship and leadership.","In the meantime, we have got a lot of work to do together as we prepare the company for closing an integration. So with that, let\u2019s start with net interest income on slide five. Our net interest income was stable sequentially as the strong loan growth we delivered was offset by two fewer days in the quarter. All else equal, this negatively impacts net interest income by approximately $20 million. Our net interest margin was also stable sequentially as the benefit of the December rate hike was offset by higher wholesale funding to support the loan growth in the quarter.","Looking to the second quarter, we expect the net interest margin to decline by 2 basis points to 3 basis points relative to the first quarter, given our expectation that funding costs will continue to increase despite the fact that we do not expect an increase in short-term rates.","Moving to slide six, noninterest income decreased by $34 million sequentially, driven primarily by seasonal decline in commercial real estate related income. Investment banking income was down sequentially, as a result of less M&A and syndicated finance activity in the quarter.","The government shutdown also negatively impacted our equity capital markets business. This was partially offset by a $36 million increase in trading income. A negative valuation marks on the corporate bond inventory we experienced in the fourth quarter were generally reversed in the first quarter and we also benefited from an increase in client activity levels.","Some of the increase in trading income was offset by a loss in our credit default swap hedge portfolio, which is another income, given tightening credit spreads. Mortgage related income also increased sequentially as a result of higher servicing income, primarily driven by better hedge performance and lower decay.","Moving to expenses on slide seven, we recognized $45 million of merger related costs in the first quarter, primarily related to third-party advisory and legal fees. Relatively, we have created a new line item in the income statement for these costs. Going forward, we expect additional merger related costs on a standalone basis of approximately $10 million each quarter.","Excluding merger costs and the $60 million pension charge in the fourth quarter, adjusted expenses increased by $22 million, as a result of the typical seasonal increase in personnel costs, partially offset by lower contract labor and programming costs, which is generally a function of timing and is therefore somewhat temporary.","Other non-interest expense also increased sequentially, driven primarily by higher branch closure-related costs. These increases were partially offset by declines across most other expense categories given seasonal trends and ongoing expense discipline.","Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 15%, which is slightly lower than our normal effective tax rate, given the typical first quarter benefits related to stock-based compensation. At the remainder of the year, we would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% and 20% if you model us on an FTE basis.","As you can see on slide eight, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 60.8% for the quarter, which represents 130 basis points of year-over-year improvement. On a standalone basis, we remained on track to achieve our previously disclosed medium-term target of 56% to 58%.","We are focused on rationalizing expenses via four primary areas, staffing, leveraging technology, third parties, and real estate, all while investing in revenue growth opportunities and client-friendly technology. Our continued progress in each of these areas gives us good momentum headed into our merger with BB&T.","More importantly, given the synergies we will achieve by merging with BB&T, we will have significantly greater capacity to invest in innovation, technology, and talent. This is one of the key benefits of this transaction, not just that we have the opportunity to achieve best-in-class efficiency, which is of course a great outcome for our shareholders, but more so to have incremental capacity for investment.","Moving now to slide nine, our net charge-off ratio was 26 basis points in the first quarter, consistent with the prior quarter and with our guidance. The low level of net charge-off reflects relative strength we are seeing across all of our portfolios.","Performance we are extremely pleased with, though we remained cognizant that there could be some variability and normalization going forward. Our non-performing loan ratio 34 basis points, which is down slightly relative to the prior quarter also remained well below historical averages.","The ALLL ratio was stable sequentially, which drove a $66 million increase in provision expense as prior quarters had declines in the ALLL ratio. Strong loan growth also contributed to our provision expense this quarter.","Looking into the remainder of 2019, we would expect our net charge-off ratio to be between 25 basis points and 30 basis points. We do expect the ALLL ratio to remain relatively stable from here, which would result in a provision expense that exceeded net charge-offs given loan growth.","Moving to the balance sheet on slide 10, we continue to deliver good loan growth, evidenced by the 3% sequential growth in average balances. Importantly, the growth was diversified across most portfolios, including C&I, CRE, indirect auto, consumer direct and mortgage.","Wholesale growth was broad based across each of our lines of business. Within CIB, loan growth was driven by higher revolver utilization, CapEx and M&A activity and growth in our asset finance business.","Commercial banking growth was broad based with strength across most client segments, including auto dealer, aging services, our expansion markets and core commercial clients. CRE growth continued as a result of investments we have made in permanent lending and bridge lending capabilities, which is being partially offset by run-off in the construction portfolio.","Within consumer, the ongoing investments we have made in our digital and point of sale lending capabilities, which provide for a superior client experience are also driving good growth, and enhancing our returns. Our auto and mortgage portfolios also demonstrated healthy growth in the quarter.","Across both Wholesale and Consumer, our underwriting discipline has not changed and we remain highly focused on ensuring that the quality of our new production is consistent with the quality of our existing portfolio.","Separately, we sold $465 million accruing residential TDR portfolio in the middle of April, which was reflected in loans held for sale on March 31st. This resulted in a transfer of $31 million of the associated allowance to a reduction of carrying value and loans held for sale.","This transaction had no impact on the provision for loan losses in the first quarter. The sale will result in a modest gain in the second quarter, which we plan to use to reposition a portion of the securities portfolio and net P&L impact will be relatively immaterial to our earnings going forward.","On the deposit side, average balances decreased sequentially, driven by seasonal declines in public funds, which benefited fourth quarter balances. Consistent with prior quarters, we continue to see a migration from the lower cost deposits to CDs, largely due to higher rates and our targeted strategies, which allow us to retain our existing depositors and capture new market share.","Interest-bearing deposit costs increased by 9 basis points sequentially, slightly lower than the prior two quarter increases of 10 basis points and 11 basis points, respectively. Given the expectation of fairly stable short-term rates, we expect deposit cost to continue to still trend upwards, but not as much as previous quarters.","The trajectory will also be influenced by the competitive environment, in addition to the levels of loan growth we are delivering. At the same time, we remain focused on investing in products and capabilities, which enhance the client experience outside of rate base.","Moving to slide 11, which provides an update on our capital position, our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.1%, and the Tier 1 ratio was 10.2%, slightly lower relative to the previous quarter, given strong loan growth, partially offset by solid growth in retained earnings.","Going forward, we would expect capital ratios to trend upward, given the suspension of share repurchases in anticipation of our merger with BB&T. This will result in a share count that is relatively stable until the proposed merger with BB&T closes. Relatively, we will not be pursuing the preferred issuance, which was included in our original 2018 capital plan.","Moving to the segment overviews, we will begin with the Consumer segment on slide 12. The positive lending momentum we had in Consumer continued in the first quarter. The investments we have made in light stream and our point-of-sale lending partnerships continued to be consistent contributors to our loan growth.","Over the past year, we focused on enhancing our analytics, improving automation, adding product offerings and growing our partnerships and referrals, all of which are key contributors to the 38% year-over-year growth we delivered in LightStream.","Separately, we experienced good growth in indirect auto this quarter, where we were able to capture additional market share given competitor exits, with improving returns. Consistent with prior quarters, some of this collective growth has been offset by the continued declines in home equity.","On the deposit side, we continued to benefit from our targeted CD offers and have refined our broader deposit product offerings to maximize the value proposition for our clients. We have had good success here, evidenced by the 3% year-over-year growth in deposits, which provides attractive funding for our loan growth. Our strong balance sheet growth combined with margin expansion drove an 8% increase in net interest income relative to the prior year.","Consumer fee income was pressured in the first quarter as a result of seasonality and changing consumer behaviors, which continues to drive the decline in service charges. Wealth management income was also negatively impacted by market conditions in the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted AUMs. Compared to the prior year, non-interest income was relatively stable as mortgage related income has begun to stabilize.","In addition to the solid revenue growth in Consumer, the actions we have taken to improve efficiency are driving improvements in overall profitability. Our efficiency ratio in Consumer improved by 230 basis points year-over-year, relatively, our branch count is down by 7% in the past year, which is largely enabled by our increasing digital adoption rates, and as a part of our broader strategy to leverage technology to enhance our efficiency, while also improving the client experience.","In the first quarter, we improved client\u2019s ability to service their mortgage via our mobile app. We made it easier for clients to open new accounts and products digitally and we continue to migrate components of our digital experience to the cloud, resulting in reduced operational costs and added reliability.","Our success here is also reflected in the national recognition we are receiving for these digital capabilities. LightStream recently received two recognitions for best personal loan for good credit and another for best personal loans for home improvement. Our adoption rate for SmartGUIDE, our digital mortgage application is now at 82%, which exceeds expectations considering we have launched this capability only a year ago.","Broadly speaking, our Consumer segment continued to improve its overall earnings power, evidenced by the 5% growth in revenues, which when combined with a moderate 2% growth in expenses drove a strong 13% growth in pre-provision net revenue.","Looking ahead, we expect further progress from Consumer as we become more efficient, continue to invest in our digital offerings and provide for a more integrated experience for our clients across all consumer products and solutions.","We are also excited about the opportunities that we will have to make incremental investments in technology and innovation, given the strong synergies our Consumer segment has with BB&T\u2019s retail community bank.","Moving to Wholesale on slide 13, where our consistent strategy continues to drive good results. On the lending side, we saw a solid loan growth across CIB, Commercial and CRE. More broadly, the growth in our Wholesale lending portfolio is a reflection of our clients\u2019 increased optimism on the economy, which has resulted in higher utilization rates and strong production level.","This growth also reflects the investments we have made to meet a broader set of client needs, particularly within CRE and aging services, in addition to our advice driven model. Importantly, this loan growth did not come at the expense of risk or return discipline. Our model is focused on leading with advice not structure or price. This is also reflected in our low net charge-off ratio, which were 10 basis points in the first quarter.","As mentioned previously, CRE fee income was down sequentially due to seasonal trends. We also saw a decline in investment banking income, consistent with industry trends. Market conditions can and do drive some quarterly variability in this business, which was certainly true this quarter in syndicated finance, M&A and equity. Some of this was offset by trading income or negative marks on our corporate bond inventory in the fourth quarter were generally reversed in the first quarter.","While sequential revenue trends in this specific quarter weren\u2019t favorable, we delivered strong 7% year-over-year revenue growth with broad-based growth across most products and client segments. More importantly, it\u2019s clear that we have a competitive advantage within this business.","We went because of our focus on the middle market, the quality of our people, the advice they deliver and the way we work together. We feel very good about the consistent growth that our advice driven model has delivered and our ability to deliver future growth as we continue to capture incremental market share.","Similar to Consumer, across Wholesale we remain focused on investing in technology with the goal of equipping our teammates with the tools they need to maximize their effectiveness and provide clients with an improved experience, especially within treasury and payments.","We are now leveraging nCino, our own origination platform for onboarding treasury and payments product, making it easier for teammates to onboard new clients whether for loan or deposit products. We have also moved our nCino platform onto new soft platform, which will significantly improve our ability to add future capabilities via APIs.","And finally, we are piloting SunView client portal, which will consolidate several separate treasury management platforms into one. Bigger picture, our Wholesale business delivered 7% growth in revenue, which when combined with 3% growth in expenses drove strong 11% growth in pre-provision net revenue, results, we are very pleased with. Looking ahead, we remained optimistic about the growth opportunities we have in Wholesale, as we bring our advice driven model to clients in new and existing markets.","We continue to focus on meeting more client needs, providing superior execution for our clients in varying market conditions, elevating our relationship and making investments, which position us for future success as we work to anticipate and exceed client expectations. We are also excited about the opportunity we will have to deliver our full suite of capital market solutions to an expanded client base as we merged with BB&T.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Great. Thanks, Allison. Now, overall, we had a good quarter and it was further validation of the success we continue to have in investing in growth opportunities, diversifying our business mix and loan portfolio, and improving our efficiency. While, overall, fee income trends were mixed, we feel good about the underlying momentum all across the company.","Provision expense did serve somewhat of a headwind to our bottom line results this quarter, but it\u2019s not a reflection of the overall asset quality trends. The increase is more of a reflection of the reserve releases we benefited from in prior quarters in addition of the strong loan growth we delivered this quarter.","The overall momentum we have continues to validate my view that SunTrust on a standalone basis is approaching the proposed merger with BB&T from a position of strength. Individually, we are two very strong companies together we are creating well premier financial institution.","With that, let me provide a little bit of progress and update on the merger on slide 14. The executive management team that we announced back in February has been meeting on a weekly basis. So we are really making good progress on key decisions about organization design, about talent, our new culture and overall integration planning among a variety of other topics.","We formally kicked off our integration planning process a few weeks ago and have identified integration leads across the businesses and functions with support from some third-party consultants. Our teams are really working well together. They have identified key work streams with a defined set of milestones, all of which we must deliver by legal day one.","As you would anticipate, risk oversight underpins the entire integration process, so we have significant controls in place to ensure the process is appropriately governed. Our teams worked effectively and efficiently to follow the merger application in the S-4 registration statement back at the beginning of the March, which is on track with our targeted timing.","With regard to our new brand, we are using this as a culture building process for our teammates and associates. We just finished a brand attribute bracket-based process and both of our respective organizations identified the same four core and as an aspirational brand attributes we desire for our new company.","In my mind, this reinforced our premise of this merger equals and its one more example of how we are coming together as one company. We have also engaged inner brand, which is a leading brand agency to help to guide us. We are targeting to have a new name and brand by the end of the second quarter.","Key leaders from SunTrust and BB&T have held listening sessions with community groups across our market, which was incredibly helpful and insightful. We are both firmly committed to responding to our community needs and continuing our strong locally focused investments.","We are working very hard to lay the groundwork for a new company culture. We both have strong cultures with high levels of teammate and associate engagement and we are both purpose and mission-driven companies. Together we are going to create a new culture that takes the best of both and we will do this together as a team with involvement from all of our teammates and our associates.","We completed our first executive team building exercise at the BB&T Leadership Institute last week and obviously planned to have more of those sessions over the next coming months. The CCAR teams across both companies are working very hard and very well together to conduct joint stress tests and submit a joint capital plan to the Federal Reserve in May.","Lastly, we are working on determining the next level of leadership for the combined company, with an objective of making those announcements in the second quarter. Our objective is to promote the best of both companies, ensure diversity and equal representation from both sides. Overall, I think, Kelly and I are incredibly pleased with the progress we have made in such a short period of time.","More importantly, the more time we spend together as a new management team and the more our teams work together, we are increasingly confident in the opportunities we have ahead of us and our ability to achieve the targeted cost saves and realize our full potential. The work we have ahead of us continues at a brisk, but controlled pace and I am highly confident that our teams will help us realize our vision of creating the premier financial institution.","So, with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Linda, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Perfect. [Operator Instructions] And we will begin with the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","I had a question on C&I loan growth and also on nCino, but just to kick off with the loan growth question. I noticed in the presentation, you mentioned it was broad based, but maybe give us a sense of how much of the loan growth that you saw this quarter, you think is sustainable, how much of it is due to not getting pay downs, we have heard from others that pay downs have slowed a bit. And so what I am really trying to understand is, do you feel this is a pickup in demand from your client or is it a reduction of competition and the legs on both those trends? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Sure. I think, first of all, it is very broad based, and I think, as you indicated in your question, it\u2019s across a variety of the specialties, it\u2019s across CRE and its cross sort of core commercial. We have seen it in the areas we have invested like aging services and we have seen it in -- on the incremental side and expansion markets where we have made investment.","So, first of all, it\u2019s broad based. The second piece is, revolver utilization was up this quarter and if we really look over sort of multi-quarters, we hit sort of a high inflection point on revolvers utilization. So this is also by clients drawing online to make investments, whether it\u2019s M&A, whether it\u2019s repayment or whether it\u2019s investment in capital or technology, but clear revolver utilization.","As, it relates to paydowns, paydowns were down this quarter, production was pretty stable to where it\u2019s been. So, I think, is 8% year-over-year, which where we are right now, I mean, that\u2019s clearly high. But our core client base, the investments we have made, the places that we are, the advice driven model, I think, we will continue to be at a good pace. Although, as you noted, I do think paydowns will pick up over the year, that will be some combination of rate, refinance and market influences.","Betsy Graseck","[Inaudible]","Bill Rogers","Yeah. You cut out. Linda, Betsy in line or?","Operator","Yeah. Let\u2019s go to the next line. And Betsy, you will just need to queue back up for a question. Next we will go to the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks. Lines cutting out a little bit here, but can you guys hear me?","Bill Rogers","Yeah.","Allison Dukes","We can.","John McDonald","Okay. Great. So maybe just a question for Allison, could you give us some of the puts and takes to your estimate of the net interest margin to be down 2 basis points to 3 basis points next quarter, is that a question of the loan growth outstripping deposit growth and what are the factors there?","Allison Dukes","Sure. It\u2019s a couple of different factors. First, I do expect deposit costs will continue to creep up a little bit. As I noted, I also believe it will be at a slower pace than what we have already seen. You have seen our deposit cost growth come down over the last three quarters from 11 basis points to 10 basis points to 9 basis points, so we expect it will continue to creep up, albeit at a little more slowly.","I also expect that loan growth is going to continue to modestly exceed deposit growth and so that\u2019s obviously a positive for NII. But that does create some wholesale funding costs that factor into the NIM guidance.","There\u2019s day count in there as well and then all of that, and modestly offset by re-pricing of our securities portfolio and fixed rate loans. So take all that together and we expect something around the range of 2 basis points to 3 basis points of the decline.","John McDonald","Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask Bill about incremental learnings about the MOE. Bill you have talked a lot of people and got feedback since the announcement, and you mentioned, you and Kelly feel very good overall. But I was wondering maybe you could give us one positive and one challenge that you have discovered. One aspect of the deal you feel better about since announcement and then one aspect that you learned might be more challenging or take longer than you initially thought? Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Fair question, John. So if I sort of start at maybe the core of the positive, the integrity, transparency and teamwork that we have had as a team has been off the charts. I don\u2019t want to say I am surprised, but that has really been a great start to the conversations that we have had, the selections we have made. As I said, we have done that with a lot of teamwork. And this is a group that didn\u2019t know each other.","While Kelly and I have known each other for a long time, we are bringing together a bunch of people that didn\u2019t know each other and haven\u2019t worked together and the way that they are doing that with speed and focus on the outcome has really been fun to be a part of.","And I think, that has mostly to do with how brought in they are and how cognizant they are of where they are in history and the opportunity that they have in front of them to create this incredible organization, incredible opportunity. So I would say that\u2019s probably bit core top positive.","As we peel back the onion and look at both cost synergies, I think, as we continue to go through that I think, our optimism improves and we start to look at where those are and how we will achieve them, and so I think, we continue to build confidence on that front.","Similarly the opportunity on the revenue side, as we look at our businesses and we have talked about of being highly complementary and that\u2019s really jumped out as they really are complementary, meaning their products and capabilities that BB&T has that we don\u2019t have and products capabilities that we have that they don\u2019t have, and we continue to find most of those. I know, I went to more than one, but I am excited on that front.","If you say that you know, what\u2019s on the challenge side? I think, just the enormity of the task, it\u2019s big. I mean, this is big and while that I have every confidence that we have got the right team in place, you do wake up and think, these are lots of actions and lots of activities that our teams have to accomplish.","John McDonald","All right. Thank you.","Operator","All right. And next, let\u2019s try Betsy\u2019s line again. Betsy?","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Can you hear me?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Sorry, Betsy.","Allison Dukes","Yeah.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. No problem. Hey, so my follow-up was on nCino, which I believe is a key tool for you on the commercial side. And if I recall correctly, I don\u2019t think BB&T had yet put that in place, so there could be some interesting opportunities there, is that goes into the combined organization? But I just wanted to understand from you the benefits that it brings to your Commercial Banking space and was there more for you to do to benefit from nCino at this stage? I thought it was fully integrated, but then in the prepared remarks, I thought I heard something around how there was more opportunity and benefit coming from the nCino?","Bill Rogers","Maybe I will take a first crack and then Allison, you can add some of the specific benefits like that we have seen in the commercial side. Yeah, I mean, I think, nCino is part of -- if you think about it as a platform, as -- maybe it is sort of the easiest way to think about it, so getting the platform in place is stage one and we have made tremendous progress and acknowledge the implementation of the platform.","Now, it\u2019s the flexibility of that platform in adding different capabilities and different speeds and different ways that we can utilize and we work really closely with nCino. I mean, we have got a great partnership. As you know, we were early in this process, so we are -- I think we are building together and thinking about all the things that we can do from a client perspective.","BB&T has also made a lot of progress in platforms as well. So these will be the kind of things that we will look through and take the best of breed approach for different client segments and different flexibilities.","And back to the earlier comment on the question from John, that\u2019s just part of the exciting part of the process, is actually getting best of breed kind of choices that we get to make along the way. And Allison you might want to embellish on that?","Allison Dukes","The only thing I will add is, that it is a cloud-based platform and that\u2019s given us a tremendous amount of flexibility and one of the things I noted as we have moved it to a new soft platform that also gives us the capability to add future APIs.","And we are looking at, we have expanded I should say, our usage of nCino to incorporate our treasury platform, so it\u2019s not just a loan origination platform for us any further. So it\u2019s about flexibility really for our teammates and efficiency there and speed of responsiveness to clients.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So your treasury platform is your cash management offering to your clients, that\u2019s what you are talking about, not your internal treasury?","Allison Dukes","Yeah. Yes, not our corporate treasury platform.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Very interesting. And then my other question is just on the brand change, I realized that in later in 2Q, you will be coming to market with the new brand. I am just wondering how are you thinking about rolling that out to the market and I know that -- I am not asking for a specific you know, its early days on this, but I am just trying to understand how you are thinking about in informing the market of the new brand in a way that is the least disruptive and the most opportunity for you?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I mean, you are right, this is one of those areas that we have had a lot of intensity and good dialog around. As the brand specifically and rollout, we have shareholder approvals coming up, so they have to approve a new brand. So that\u2019s sort of the first stages of the naming of the entity.","We will also be operating sort of our core -- if they buy core retail business that\u2019s full lack of a better description under the SunTrust and BB&T brands and we will be doing that for let\u2019s call it 18 months to 24 months as those roll out.","Then you have asked really the right question is, then how do you roll out the umbrella brand and whose first on the sequence in terms of how you roll out that brand and how do you make sure that you are promoting that at the right pace and with the right intensity and that\u2019s the sleeves rolled up work we are doing right now.","Actually back to the [inaudible] this is one of the exciting really new opportunities for our company. As I highlighted before, we have asked our teammates and associates to be part of this and build this as a culture moment. So this is a lot more than a name that we are going to put out somewhere on the building. This is really about being exemplified what we are going to stand for as a company.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Yeah.","Operator","Next we will go to the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Just a two part question on preparations for the MOE, Bill, one is, what is the sentiment of the employees like and what are you and your team doing to minimize distraction going into the merger close? And the second part of that question is, as I think about some of the investment spend that you -- investment spend that you have completed like in nCino, and further projects that you may have, how are you determining what to continue to go through in terms of investment spend versus what you may suspend prior to the deal closing?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Okay. Good questions. The -- first of all, as it relates to our teammates and associates and I can speak specifically on the SunTrust side, but obviously on the BB&T side with associates we have. The first thing is, we are communicating a lot and we are having town halls, we have videos, we have teleconferences, we have things that we are sitting at post on our website.","So we are communicating a lot of our status of where we are, because the thing that makes people most uncomfortable as that when things are unsettled. And we want to make sure that they know where things are, they know the progress, they know when we are going to make announcements, and we can be on that front.","The second is, I mean, I get up every day, I think, Kelly, does the same way. I mean, I get up every day to re-recruit everybody works here. I mean, that\u2019s sort of my philosophy and how I think about the world.","And the opportunity to recruit, not just to SunTrust, but to recruit to NewCo is really exciting. I mean, I think, about the opportunity to talk to our teammates about joining this new company that shares their values, that cares about them that they know in the capacity to invest and things that are important to them, things that are important to their clients, the new capabilities, new training, and even more so their career opportunities.","So their own personal career opportunities are going to expand exponentially. I mean, the markets that we are in that we never in before, there are things that we do that we didn\u2019t do before. So we are taking the philosophy that we are recruiting to NewCo and I like the job. I mean, I think, I like doing that. I think, that\u2019s an incredible opportunity.","As to how to determine, as I said before, I mean, this is a best of breed optionality. So we have got integration teams that represent both sides equally. I mean, we -- so at every intersection point as it relates to whatever it may be, platform, application. We have people sitting at the table and their mission is to not choose one of the others to choose the best and if that doesn\u2019t exist, we may choose something that\u2019s an alternative to what we each have.","So this is a -- this isn\u2019t -- this is a -- and I think, our teammates recognize that this is a once-in a generational opportunity to really choose the best alternatives that are strong for clients and strong for communities and make our companies more efficient. So we -- I think, Kelly and I have been very clear that it\u2019s a best of breed process and the winner is going to be the client, the teammate and the shareholder.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a follow-up question for Allison, I noticed that other short-term borrowings on an average basis were up almost $5 billion. And as I thought about your earlier comments on loan growth outstripping deposit growth. Is it fair to assume that perhaps before the merger close, you will just -- you are filling the gap with short-term borrowings rather than increase your deposit rates that significantly, because this seems like something that once the balance sheets are put together could be optimized?","Allison Dukes","Well, okay, thinking about deposit growth, that\u2019s really client relationships and we are not going to change our focus on building client relationships and augmenting our existing deposit base and growing relationships overall. So I would say our focus on growing deposits and the momentum we have there, we will be sustaining that into closing.","As we bring our balance sheets together, we actually have an outstanding funding base between SunTrust and BB&T in terms of both our deposit base, our client base and our access to wholesale funding. So I don\u2019t think -- I don\u2019t anticipate that we would have any shift in how we actually fund the balance sheet, we are really focused on growing client business.","Erika Najarian","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","All right. And next we will go to the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. Deposit re-pricing question, is there a pricing still happening within the same product, so money market re-pricing up, checking re-pricing up as you look forward, or is it more about continued mix shift into higher rate products and does it vary by market in terms of just re-pricing overall?","Allison Dukes","It really -- I would say from a product standpoint, our strategy is still consistent with where it has been for the last year or so. We are still going to really focused on using CDs as a targeted strategy does continue to re-price of course over time as well. But we are not looking at a change in our product mix, even as we anticipate the Fed being on pause over the course of the year.","From a geographic standpoint, we are always in any rate cycle evaluating the differences from a geographic standpoint. The competition is different in every market and we really think about pricing differently in every market and that sensitivity is there in any rate cycle.","Bill Rogers","That\u2019s right. Matt, the other thing is, we are -- it\u2019s not a pure defense in play either, so we are using CD pricing in offering, there\u2019s an offensive play in the client acquisition vehicle as well.","Allison Dukes","Yeah. Our CD strategy has yielded, I think, about 40% of our CD growth is new money, so it\u2019s a targeted acquisition strategy as well.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And Bill, a separate topic here, but just as you think about the combined, the capital or the capital of the combined company, Charlie said earlier today, the Board has decided to hold 10% CET1, at least initially. I know, you have obviously optimized capital at SunTrust down to 9.1% and I know you have been asked before, but it would seem like over time there will be opportunity to bring down that 10% and I don\u2019t know if you have more confidence as the integration was completed successfully, but just thoughts on there is a little bit of a bid ask in terms of where you want capital, or they want capital in the combined company, you would think wouldn\u2019t need to have as much excess maybe as BB&T standalone.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Well, first and foremost, let me say, we are aligned. So we are aligned on 10% capital as a really good starting point for our company. I think, as you noted, I mean, that can change over time. But, I think, as we -- particularly as we enter into this merger and we look at all the integration and the things that we have got to do over the course of the next two years, the last thing we want to have as the discussion is about capital.","We want to make sure that if it\u2019s conservative, fine, that\u2019s a good label, but we want to have a capital base that can withstand any changes anticipated or unanticipated, and then will be a factor of wherever the economic environment is when we get through that process.","So we are aligned on this. I think, this is a good strategy. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contrary to optimizing capital. I think it\u2019s consistent with optimizing capital against the situation that you are in right now, which is a big merger.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","All right. And our last question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Please go ahead.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Marinac","Bill, there are a lot of banks you talk about the opportunities that they feel from the combination of SunTrust and BB&T. I am curious to what extent you feel that you need to play defense as you integrate the merger or is it more the opposite that you just continue to forge ahead on the offense as you have been?","Bill Rogers","As I said before, I mean, we are on offense. We are recruiting to NewCo. I mean, we are recruiting to the premier financial institution in the country in terms of new capabilities and new geography, and new markets, and I mean I -- I have never had so many tools to recruit.","So to us, it\u2019s about not only recruiting our existing teammates and associates, but the calls are coming the other way, trust me, people want to join our organization and we are seeing that. So, I think, this is the merger end, but I love the tools that we have to recruit well.","Christopher Marinac","That\u2019s great. Thanks very much, guys.","Ankur Vyas","Linda, I think, it looks like we had one more joined the queue.","Operator","Yeah. We will go to the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hey. Thanks guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick things, first of all, connected to the pre-merger planning, you are having really good loan growth and I am just wondering that just -- does anything change with regards to the types of lending or the types of risk or the types of mix in over the next few quarters that you look at putting on in contemplation of the pro forma and the post merger company, sorry?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I mean, a short answer to that\u2019s no. We are building a business that\u2019s consistent with our risk profile and our risk profile is consistent with the combined risk profile. So I would fully expect us to be on the same pace and it reflects the diversity of our business mix and other things I think, make us a great merger partner.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And second one, I was just wondering if you could flush out, even with the slowdown in the government, the IB still did pretty decent. Just wondering if you can flush out a little bit more about the pipeline that did things get pushed and just your general thoughts as you look out word for the investment banking business?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. The pipeline looks good, and particularly in M&A it looks good, which I think, I sort of look for, I mean, you have a lot of market fluctuations in investment banking based on a bunch of conditions. But the core sort of advice business, which M&A is I think, reflects is strong from a pipeline perspective and I think, that\u2019s consistent with the investments we have made have been in the advice driven forefront of our relationships all across the spectrum, from our Commercial business, our non-CIB business, and Investment Banking has grown about 50% on that pipeline looks particularly strong.","So I feel good about where we are in terms of pipelines, plus leads are growing. They have been growing at 15% to 20%. So our relevance with clients and not only we are having more at-bat, the power of those at-bats are increasing. But yet they still only reflect a small part of our total portfolio. So I have any reason to be -- continued to be very optimistic and our opportunities in investment banking.","Ken Usdin","Thanks for the color, Bill.","Bill Rogers","Yeah.","Operator","All right. And next we will go to the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hey, Bill. My short question is, how do you deal with the differences in the cultures? That\u2019s the same question I asked to Kelly King and the longer version of that is. I mean, this, two out of three mergers don\u2019t pan out well, two out of three bank mergers don\u2019t pan out well, so we have to be convinced that this is one of the three that actually work well, and what are the reasons -- piece to be related to cultural risk and the road is littered with examples, whether it\u2019s Citigroup, Bank of America, the old Bank One for Chicago. So after several decades of seeing these mergers, you weren\u2019t as acquisitive as some of your peers and now you are doing one. So specifically as it relates to cultural risk, three parts. Number one, as SunTrust seems a little bit more large corporate, capital markets oriented, you might say more urban than BB&T. Number two, there is likely to be some inevitable employee concerns. And then number three, there is likely to be some inevitable CEO disagreements. So have you discussed and how do you plan deal with those likely disagreements like in other words what kind of pre-marriage counseling have you had if you are getting married and you wanted some advice so? Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Okay. You threw me off with the last part of your question, but I got it. And look Kelly and I are both conscious that the culture is imperative to making this work and it\u2019s really been a strong part of our -- both of our companies.","So I am going to sort of put in some parts. If you look at sort of the core foundation, you sort of look for things that are deeply in the ground, we have a lot of incredible similarities. I mean, we are purpose and mission companies. We get up thinking about the big why.","Kelly and I both lead in that same fashion. So I think, our teams and our companies are sort of the strong foundation of the house, that\u2019s really, really solid and I think it\u2019s a very, very, very much aligned.","As you sort of go up the chain on the cultural differences. I mean, sure, there will be some differences, but we are going to celebrate those. I mean, I view those as opportunities. I view those as opportunities to come together under a new culture, pick the best of both, do it together, do it as a team.","As I mentioned earlier, all the teamwork stuff has been really, really working well and got started off to a great start. So we will do that together. The final results will be more inclusive. It will be have grave engagement at the outset and throughout and I think I personally and I think our teams are going to be really excited about that.","I don\u2019t expect sort of urban and rural definition. So if that\u2019s your implication, I don\u2019t even accept that as of premise. I think we are great bankers and BB&T are great bankers and we are going to work together well.","Our teammates and associates, I think, on balance are really excited about where this is going. I said before, we are doing a lot of communication. We are doing a lot of re-recruiting, spending a lot of time in front of teammates and I think they are excited about this venture and the opportunities that they have in it.","As it relates to CEO disagreement, so me and Kelly are can\u2019t agree on everything. I think that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s what makes a vibrant outcome. But I am 100% sure we are going to start everything from the right framework. We are going to start it from why. We are going to started from purpose and we are going to standard for mission and as long as we start there, I am confident that the outcomes will be really, really strong and great for shareholders and teammates and associates and communities, and clients.","Mike Mayo","And just one quick follow-up, so when you define a new culture, what does that mean when you take best of breed, could you be a little more specific, give a couple of examples, like what do you want to take from SunTrust, what do you take from BB&T, can you just put a little bit more meat on the bones of this idea of a new culture? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I think we are working on those things. If you define cultures, carrying about people and putting clients first and being community diverse business models, lower risk, less volatile profiles, one team focus. I mean, those are all things that we have in common.","The choices are more around how you activate and how do you pick the best of what teams do. We are looking to put a pension plan in SunTrust that BB&T has, that\u2019s a great cultural aspect that our teammates are going to benefit from.","We are going to put our momentum on up, teammate focused financial bonus program into the BB&T system. That\u2019s a great way for both of them to benefit and it\u2019s an example of you choose from both, but your foundation is we care.","We care about you. We care about your wife\u2019s ambitions and we want you to stay and be part of this company. So those are just some examples. Mike of how we are going to go back and choose positives more in terms of how we activate against really strong cultures.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","Okay. Thanks everyone. Linda, this concludes our call. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the IR department.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does concludes your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

Any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to turn over the meeting to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Angela. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call.

We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.

The only authorized live and archived webcast are located on our website.","With that, I will turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Ankur and good morning everyone. I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter then I am going to turn over to Aleem for some additional details. Following Aleem\u2019s comments, I will review our performance at the business segment level.","We delivered strong results this quarter as we made further progress against our key strategies, which include optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and increasing our capital return to shareholders. Earnings per share, after excluding $0.11 of non-core items, were $0.89 and up a solid 10% compared to the adjusted level a year ago. Our active balance sheet management and optimization efforts improved our overall earning asset and funding mix, resulting in an 8 basis point improvement in net interest margin and $44 million sequential increase in net interest income.","Period-end loans were up 1% driven largely by growth in higher return consumer portfolios resulting in a more diversified and profitable loan mix. We remain confident in our ability to generate additional and targeted growth in segments where returns are appropriate when we can have deeper relationships. However, we will continue to closely manage areas that are not meeting our thresholds and according with our goal of improving the overall returns of the company.","Average deposits were up 2% sequentially as our core growth initiatives continue to gain momentum. Growing deposits, while also maintaining appropriate pricing discipline, remains an important part of our strategic efforts to strengthen client relationships and improve profitability. In addition, our strong deposit growth has allowed us to significantly reduce our higher cost wholesale funding over the last 6 months.","The sequential decline in non-interest income was driven by lower capital markets and mortgage production income, primarily the result of a strong second quarter, but also the result of challenging market conditions during the third quarter. Relative to the prior year, adjusted non-interest income increased 2% primarily due to our continued success in meeting more of our clients\u2019 capital markets needs. This is further evidence of our differentiated wholesale banking platform and the positive returns we are realizing on our investments in this segment. Expenses were stable relative to prior year at down 5% versus the prior quarter. While some of the sequential decline was nonrecurring and seasonal in nature, we continue to carefully manage expenses given this revenue environment.","Our performance this quarter resulted in an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 61% for the third quarter and 62.9% year-to-date. As you all know, we have been working diligently toward our goal of sub 63% for the full year and we took another step in the right direction this quarter. Improving efficiency remains a strategic priority with a long-term goal of being sub 60%. Our asset quality performance continues to be very strong with NPLs down 4% and the net charge-off ratio declining 5 basis points to 21 basis points. This performance can be attributed to the significant actions we have taken over the past several years to de-risk, diversify and improve the quality of our loan production. However, we also recognize that our provision expense is at very low levels and will eventually normalize. Our capital position improved slightly with our common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.9% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. We are able to improve our capital position, while also returning nearly 60% of our earnings to shareholders this quarter.","So to recap, we delivered solid bottom line results that further enhance shareholder value this quarter with return on assets and return on tangible common equity increasing to 1.1% and 12.8% respectively and tangible book value per share increasing 4% sequentially. Our strategies of optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities and improving efficiency continue to yield positive results, creating value for our clients and shareholders.","So with that as an overview, I am going to turn over to Aleem to provide some more details on this quarter\u2019s performance.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody and thank you for joining us this morning. Earnings per share in the third quarter, was $1 even, which compares to $0.89 in the previous quarter and $0.81 on an adjusted basis last year. We recognized $0.07 of discrete tax benefits this quarter, which were recorded as a lower provision for income taxes in addition to $0.04 of discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters, which were recorded in non-interest expense.","Excluding these non-recurring benefits, earnings per share were $0.89 and relatively stable to the second quarter as higher net interest income and lower non-interest expense were mostly offset by lower non-interest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, core earnings per share grew 10% driven by a lower loan loss provision, higher capital markets and mortgage-related income and solid loan and deposit growth. All of which helps to counteract the 9 basis point decline in the net interest margin during that time frame.","We will now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on Slide 5. Net interest income increased 4% sequentially driven by lower premium amortization expense in the securities portfolio, lower wholesale funding and higher commercial loan swap income. Each of which is a reflection of our continued efforts to actively manage and optimize our balance sheet. Net interest margin improved 8 basis points, primarily due to the same factors that drove the increase in net interest income, in addition to improved core loan yields and loan mix.","Relative to the guidance we provided in July, NIM was higher-than-anticipated as we retired higher cost wholesale funding and core loan yields were firm, albeit for just one quarter so far. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was fairly stable as the declines in earning asset yields were largely offset by growth in earning assets and also by the reduction in wholesale funding, which was in turn driven by the strong deposit growth we generated over the past year. Looking ahead, we expect fourth quarter net interest margin to be relatively stable to the third quarter. Despite the expected stability next quarter, NIM will likely grind down in 2016 as long as interest rates remain low. Overall, we continue to manage the balance sheet to where net interest income would benefit from a rise in short-term rates, while also ensuring we carefully manage our risk to lower-for-longer scenarios.","Moving on to Slide 6, non-interest income decreased $63 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the expected decline in capital markets related income given the record second quarter, coupled with increased market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking income was $115 million in the third quarter, down $30 million sequentially, but up $27 million compared to the prior year. Lower high yield and equity origination fees were the primary drivers of the sequential decline, while the strong year-over-year growth was driven by most product groups. In particular, M&A, a business we continue to grow as a result of building deeper client relationships and increased expertise.","Trading income also declined in the third quarter as wider credit spreads and elevated volatility resulted in reduced client activity and lower valuations of inventory. Mortgage production income declined $18 million, primarily due to the anticipated decline in refinance volumes. Gain on sale margins were also lower though primarily as a result of changes in channel mix. Conversely, mortgage servicing income increased to $10 million due to lower decay expense and higher levels of core servicing fees as a result of continued steady growth in the servicing portfolio. We also recorded $7 million in net securities gains and $11 million of debt extinguishment costs, which are recorded in non-interest expense to slightly reposition the balance sheet. Net, these transactions had a minor upfront negative P&L impact, but will modestly improve our forward NIM and net interest income. Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income was up 2% as growth in capital markets and mortgage-related income offset the decline in service charges and trust and investment management income.","Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense declined $64 million sequentially due to lower personnel expenses in addition to discrete recoveries recognized in the third quarter. Personnel expenses declined $31 million due to the higher levels of incentive based compensation recorded in the previous quarter given strong business performance as well as declines in benefits costs and FICO taxes, some of which is seasonal. Operating losses and other non-interest expense benefited from $20 million and $12 million, respectively of separate discrete recoveries related to the resolution of previous mortgage matters. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase in marketing expenses due to higher advertising costs. Compared to the second quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest expense declined slightly as lower operating losses and personnel costs were partially offset by higher outside processing and software expenses.","As you can see on Slide 8, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.0% in the third quarter, down 90 basis points from the last year. Year-to-date, the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is now 62.9% and puts us on track to achieve our full year goal of being sub-63%. For several years now, we have been committed to becoming a more efficient and effective company and we are highly focused on continuing to make progress toward our long-term efficiency ratio goal of sub-60%.","Let\u2019s turn to credit quality on Slide 9. The net charge-off ratio was 21 basis points, down five basis points from the prior quarter and 18 basis points from the prior year. Non-performers also declined slightly and now represent 35 basis points of loans. While overall asset quality conditions are likely to remain favorable in the near-term, future quarters will be impacted by discrete situations and sectors, given the current low levels of net charge-offs and non-performers. The allowance for loan and lease losses and the ALLL ratio declined $48 million and five basis points respectively compared to the previous quarter. These reductions were driven by the continued improvement in asset quality. Provision expense increased slightly as lower net charge-offs were offset by higher loan growth and a smaller reserve release.","With regard to our energy portfolio, we took further action this quarter to build additional reserves given the decline in commodity prices. As this portfolio represents only 2% of total loans with less than half of this portfolio in the E&P and oil field services sectors, our risk here remains very manageable. Similar to the guidance we provided in the previous quarter, we will [Technical Difficulty] fourth quarter provision expense to increase sequentially, but be lower than the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of our efforts to improve asset quality. Looking into 2016, we expect provision expense to more closely match net charge-offs as the improvements in asset quality will abate. Wholesale, net charge-offs are likely to increase from here as we do not believe the third quarter level is sustainable. Ultimately our reserves will be determined by our rigorous quarterly review process, which are informed by trends in the loan portfolio combined with a view on economic conditions.","Let\u2019s turn to balance sheet trends. Average performing loans were relatively stable due to the $1 billion auto securitization we completed in June. Period end loans were up almost 1% relative to June 30 with growth across most loan categories. C&I loans declined slightly as growth in a number of industry verticals and client segments was offset by continued elevated pay downs and further reductions in lower return portfolios. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $2.5 billion or 2%, driven by 6% growth in the C&I portfolio and $1.7 billion of growth in our consumer direct book as a result of continued momentum in our LightStream business and GreenSky partnership. The growth in C&I and consumer direct loans was partially offset by continued pay downs in the home equity portfolio and reductions in indirect consumer loans given the competitive environment in auto lending. Going forward, we continue to seek opportunities to help finance our clients\u2019 growth plans, particularly given the solid economic conditions in our markets. Production trends and pipelines remain healthy and we will continue to keep a high focus on improving returns and ensuring new business exceeds our cost of capital.","Turning to deposits on Slide 11, average client deposits were up $2.4 billion or 2% compared to the prior quarter and 10% compared to the prior year driven by growth across most lines of business. We continue to be pleased with the momentum on the deposit front. Our success here reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients\u2019 deposit and payment needs, supplemented by investments in technology platforms and client facing bankers across both the consumer private wealth and wholesale segments. In particular, our corporate liquidity product specialists within wholesale banking are doing an outstanding job of deepening client relationships with our treasury and payments product offerings. And as Bill noted earlier our strong deposit growth directly enabled us to reduce higher cost long-term debt by $4.6 billion over the past six months.","Our broader enterprise wide focus on deposits was also evident in the recent release of FDIC deposit market share data where SunTrust grew faster than the competition and increased our national market share by four basis points. Importantly, the strong growth we have delivered has not resulted in any adverse changes in rates paid or mix. Low cost deposit growth continues to be strong, while higher cost deposits continue to gradually decline. As interest rates rise, some of these trends will normalize. However, we will maintain a disciplined approach to pricing with a focus on maximizing our value proposition for clients.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately another $250 million during Q3 as a result of growth in retained earnings and the estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phased in basis increased to 9.9%. Tangible book value per share increased 4% from the prior quarter, driven by growth in retained earnings and higher unrealized gains in the securities portfolio. We repurchased $175 million of common stock and paid $0.24 dividend in the quarter per our 2015 capital plan. Our liquidity coverage ratio continued to exceed the January 1, 2016, 90% requirement.","Lastly, I would like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Fitch Ratings last week, which was a reflection of our improved earnings profile, strong asset quality performance and balanced and diversified business model. Our credit ratings across all three major rating agencies have generally improved over the past year, which is positive for our teammates, clients and investors.","With that, I will now turn things back over to Bill to cover performance at the business segment level.","Bill Rogers","Great, thanks, Aleem and I will start on Slide 13. Our Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management segment continue to demonstrate solid steady growth this quarter. Net income was up 7% over prior year driven mainly by lower provision expense. Core operating performance was also solid as pre-provision net revenue increased 2% compared to the prior year and 3% sequentially.","Net interest income continues to steadily improve in this segment that bodes our balance sheet optimization efforts aimed at improving returns and deposit growth momentum. Average loans were stable sequentially as growth in higher return portfolios, including consumer direct and credit card, offset the impact of the $1 billion auto securitization in June. Deposits were up 6% year-over-year with growth being driven by continued execution of our strategy of deepening client relationships, particularly in our mass affluent and high net worth segments.","Our premier bankers in SummitView platform are examples of where our investments in talent and technology have accelerated our growth. We also introduced new checking account packages in August, simultaneously simplifying and improving our product offering in addition to increasing our value proposition to students and families, consistent with our company\u2019s purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.","Non-interest income was down marginally compared to the prior quarter and year. Service charges remained pressured as client behavior continues to change. Wealth Management related income declined modestly this quarter given market conditions, which resulted in lower assets under management and reduced transactional activity. Irrespective of short-term market fluctuations, many more of our clients wealth and investments needs, continues to be a strategic priority for the company. Expenses in this business have been well-controlled and we have been using efficiency gains to invest in client-facing technology and talent. We continue to generate solid returns from our digital investments with steady increases in mobile penetration, digital sales and self-service deposits with the latter representing now 26% of total deposits received in the third quarter.","Bigger picture, the progress we have made of optimizing the balance sheet, meeting more client needs and investing in technology has helped offset the negative impact of the prolonged low rate environment. The economies in our Southeast and Mid-Atlantic markets continue to perform well and we are uniquely well-positioned to meet the growing needs of each of our client segments.","So, let\u2019s go to wholesale next, which has been a key growth engine for the company and had a solid quarter despite challenging market conditions. Total revenue was down 6% relative to the prior quarter, but up 12% compared to prior year. The sequential quarter decline was driven by lower capital markets related income primarily because we were coming off a record second quarter, but also due in part to market volatility in the third quarter. Investment banking had a third highest quarter ever and was up 31% compared to a year ago. M&A investment-grade bond originations and equity sales and trading all had strong quarters, each a reflection of the strategic investments we have been making to expand and diversify our capabilities. Strength in these product areas help to mitigate declines and high-yield bond and equity originations driven by elevated market volatility. Trading income was lower this quarter as choppy market conditions led to increased volatility, wider credit spreads and reduced client activity.","Net interest income was up 6% year-over-year driven by strong loan and deposit growth though this was partially offset by a decline in spreads. Average loans declined 1% sequentially and increased 6% year-over-year. We continue to generate solid growth across a number of industry verticals and lines of businesses. However, this has been offset by elevated payoffs and intentional reductions in lower return areas. While the overall lending environment remains competitive, we have seen more stability in portfolio and production yields over the past few months. Production and pipeline trends are healthy and we remain focused on generating profitable growth both for SunTrust and our clients.","Deposits were up 5% sequentially and 18% year-over-year with broad-based growth across all major lines of businesses. Our strong performance here can be attributed to enhancements in our treasury and payment product offerings, the success of our liquidity specialist in CIB and increased intensity in meeting more of our wholesale client needs on the deposit front. Provision expense grew relative to the prior quarter and prior year as we continue to proactively increase the energy portfolio reserve given the decline in oil prices in the third quarter. With that said, SunTrust exposure to the exploration and production in oilfield services sector, which are the more severely impacted by decline in oil prices continues to represent only 1% of our total loan portfolio. Overall, asset quality in Wholesale Banking and the company continues to be very strong.","Non-interest expense was up 6% over the prior year largely due to the continued strategic investments in CIB and improved business performance, but more importantly, wholesale\u2019s overall efficiency ratio improved relative to last year. We believe our Wholesale Banking business is highly differentiated as we bring large bank capabilities and a One Team approach to mid-corporate and middle-market clients. This differentiation has led to continued growth and left lead relationships both with corporate and commercial clients giving us continued optimism in the long-term growth outlook for the Wholesale Banking segment.","Moving to the market segment where bottom line performance was aided by approximately $50 million of non-recurring benefits, which Aleem discussed earlier. Excluding these benefits, mortgage still had a solid quarter as continued expense discipline and further de-risking, combined with a larger servicing portfolio and an improving purchase market mitigated the anticipated decline in refinance volumes.","Revenues were relatively stable sequentially as higher servicing income help to offset the decline in production income, a reflection of the balance between servicing and production, particularly during periods of elevated refinance swings. Our servicing portfolio is up 12% compared to a year ago due largely to portfolio acquisitions as we view performing servicing as a core competency and a solid ROE business. On a year-over-year basis, the decline in revenue was primarily driven by $41 million loan sale gain in the third quarter of 2014. Excluding this gain, revenue was generally stable as higher non-interest income was generally offset by lower net interest income due to a decline in loan spreads and the prior year loan sale.","Mortgage production income increased 29%, largely due to increased purchase activity in our markets as consumer confidence continues to steadily rise and the housing market recovers. Total applications increased 20% compared to the prior year with purchase applications up 15%, evidence of the continued rebound in the housing market in addition to lower rates. Asset quality improved this quarter if net charge-offs and nonperforming loans continue to be on the downward trajectory, resulting in further declines in the residential mortgage-related allowance. And given the quality of new production combined with stable to improving housing markets, we would expect overall asset quality in the mortgage business to continue to trend favorably, but not necessarily at the level or pace of recent quarters.","Expenses were lower both sequentially and year-over-year due primarily to discrete recoveries in the current quarter related to legacy matters. Excluding these items, expenses are still well-controlled as cost-saving efforts and reduced credit-related expenses have generally offset growth in production-related cost in investments and technology.","Big picture, after years of operating and credit-related challenges, the mortgage business has become a more steady contributor to bottom line performance of the company, has also improved its focus and execution around creating a better client experience and delivering the entire bank to our mortgage clients.","So before I conclude, I want to highlight our announcement yesterday regarding certain management changes. These changes align top talent with significant opportunities at our company and this will help sharpen our focus and enhance our growth prospects. Tom, Brad, Jerome and Dorinda are all seasoned executives and I am confident in their individual and collective capability to lead their respective units and deliver on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being.","So, to recap the third quarter, we made solid progress against key strategies, including optimizing our business mix and balance sheet, investing in growth opportunities, improving efficiency and growing our capital return. Our active management of the balance sheet has resulted in an improved net interest income and margin. At the same time, while our asset quality performance is strong, current levels of provision expense are not sustainable in the long-term. Year-over-year non-interest income trends are solid and reflective of our strategy to meet a wider array of client needs. In addition, we are mindful of the intense expense discipline required to operate in this environment and also to support continued investments in our company. Overall, I remain optimistic about our company\u2019s strategic direction and our ability to deliver further value to our clients and shareholders.","So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and let\u2019s take some Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks Bill. Angela, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so I would like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Great. Hi, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Ken Usdin","Aleem, you are establishing a nice new seasonality of being able to really show expense control in the third quarter of each year. I know some of that is related to some of the comp-related fee businesses. But I know you get this question every quarter, but can you talk to us about, is this finally formally kind of a new sub 13 bar and what pressures would you see if any to kind of take you back up off this level?","Aleem Gillani","Well, thank you for noticing Ken. No, I wouldn\u2019t say that our bar is a sub-13. I think when you think about the revenue base that we have here, core expense level of around 1.3 is about right for us as I say, at this type of revenue \u2013 this type of revenue level. But as you know, we are really just more focused on the efficiency ratio rather than on the expense number itself. And as long as we can continue to grow revenue, we are not averse to growing expenses as long as it helps revenue at a better pace and we improve our operating leverage and efficiency ratio. If we do get revenue growth in the next year or two, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see expenses move up, but continuing our trend of becoming a more efficient company. If revenue stays where it is, then think about expense levels around $1.3 billion sort of give or take.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And my follow-up just is on this overall size of the balance sheet is really now flattened out for a good couple of quarters and you have had the sales that look like maybe they finalized out and you are kind of where you are and beyond on the securities book. So do you expect much growth at some point here on the average earning asset side or is there still more churn to happen from the mix perspective?","Aleem Gillani","Well, from a mix perspective, there is still going to be I think, some change as we continue to try to grow our direct consumer business as well as focusing on higher return businesses across the other segments. So I think you will see a little bit of mix change still happening. We are continuing to try to work and optimize our balance sheet in every one of our businesses. In terms of overall balance sheet growth and loan growth, it will \u2013 we haven\u2019t had much loan growth in Q2. We are starting to see it pick up again a little bit in Q3. Looking forward, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see loan growth kind of at the pace we saw in Q3. That\u2019s not an unreasonable level given the relatively low economic growth that we are seeing across the country. I think the other place we might see some growth in earning assets, if you think about moving through \u201816, perhaps will be in the securities book as we need to move from sort of 90% LCR compliance rate to 100% compliance rate in 2017. And that might require some additions in HQLA and securities and you might see some growth in earning assets, but of course that will also help on the net interest income side as we grow assets.","Ken Usdin","Understood. Okay. Thanks Aleem.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Yes. Hi, good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning. Hi, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Hi. Just to follow-up to Ken\u2019s question. This management team has clearly done an excellent job managing down this efficiency ratio, but the market expectation for revenue growth for the industry seems to be tempering for 2016. And I am wondering relative to your long-term goal of below 60% efficiency, what the decision is in terms of let\u2019s say the Fed raises very slowly or doesn\u2019t raise at all in 2016 on sort of what \u2013 where are you going to attack the efficiency ratio the most aggressively, whether it\u2019s still numerators side and maybe taking down that $1.3 billion quarterly level or are you confident in what you are doing on the revenue side for next year and that there is some offset there?","Aleem Gillani","Erika, let me start that with sort of I think the Fed part of your question there and then maybe Bill can talk to you about the efficiency ratio approach that we have got overall. We, as you know in our case, we have sort have been in the lower for longer camp for some time and set ourselves up appropriately for that type of an approach. As we look forward into \u201816, I think also lower for longer stays, I think if there are Fed increases, they will be very deliberate and the pace of rate rise will probably be slower now than the market had been thinking six months ago. Having said that again, we are setting ourselves up so that we benefit from that type of an approach. In terms of expenses relative to revenue, we will continue to try to improve the efficiency of the company. We have been on a path now for many years. We are going to continue to be on that path. And we understand that we need to get better. So to the extent that we don\u2019t get a tailwind from rate rise, we will be looking at other ways to grow income, whether that is net interest income or non-interest income. And we will be looking for ways to manage expenses such that our efficiency ratio continues to keep us on that path of becoming more efficient.","Bill Rogers","Maybe a good way to look at it is sort of tale of two cities. If you look at our two largest business segments, if you look at our consumer private wealth segment, it\u2019s more rate dependent. So it has more rate variables to it. And you can see there that the top line growth in left, but we have continued to manage expenses and increase efficiency. Then you sort of shift to wholesale, which is less rate dependent and you see there that we have continue to grow the business at sort of good double-digit kind of revenue numbers and continue to increase efficiency. So the answer is to all the questions is yes. I think we want to be able to grow the business where we can grow it and all along being focused on the efficiency side. And if we see opportunities to invest and that increases expenses, while at the same time improving efficiency, we are going to do it. If we don\u2019t see those opportunities then we are going to grind down a little harder on the expense side. And that will literally be a line of business by a line of business kind of analysis and diagnosis.","Erika Najarian","That\u2019s clear. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hi, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Maybe I could ask one of the questions that was asked in a little bit of different way. So when I think about the outlook of NIM grinding lower a little bit, we shouldn\u2019t expect too much balance sheet growth just because of the strategy that\u2019s being pursued. So, on the revenue side, we are left with obviously growing fee income, but how do we think about the continued management of the asset liability management in terms of continuing to add more swaps. And then I guess related to that, despite the fact that it looks like you might have added some stocks, the asset sensitivity did go up a lot. So, can you just walk us through the puts and takes of what happened, I am assuming you have something to do with prepayment speeds in the mortgage business?","Bill Rogers","And maybe for you jump into the harder part of that question, I want to be clear we don\u2019t have a strategy that doesn\u2019t have growth in our balance sheet. So, what we want to do is optimize our balance sheet and business mix. So, where we see opportunities for growth in the balance sheet that are positive contributors to that strategy, we are going to absolutely take advantage of them. We haven\u2019t seen as many of those in the last couple of quarters. So, we don\u2019t have a flat balance sheet type of strategy. We have an optimized balance sheet business mix and more importantly, focus on growth and return strategy. And maybe with that said, Aleem, let me turn over to you.","Aleem Gillani","Sure. Well, thanks for the question, Ryan. Look, when I think about the swaps book, Ryan, I sort of think about it as the tail wagging the dog. And if you think about our overall loans, our natural position on loans is 60% of the loans that we generate and 60% of the loans that we produce are floating rates. And so that naturally makes us more and more asset sensitive every month as we continue to do new business. The tail part of this is all the swaps do is take about 12% to 14% of those floating rate loans and effectively turn them into fixed rate loans. So, in the context of our overall book, it\u2019s sort of the smaller part of that. And what we will do with the swaps and securities and which loans that we produce to emphasize and which loans we deemphasize really is going to be economy dependent, client needs as well as our view of the structural balance sheet and structural rates. So, the swap component ends up being a pretty sort of smallish part of that decision process.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And if I could ask a follow-up on credit, I think both of you made comments, I think, Bill you said something to the extent of an eventual normalization and Aleem, you said something about 20 basis points of charge-offs not being sustainable. And I guess as you look out if rates end up staying low, you guys have done a great job de-risking the balance sheet. How should we think about a more reasonable level of charge-offs if we stay in a similar kind of environment and what does that eventually mean for the loan loss provision?","Aleem Gillani","Well, as we think about our overall risk profile and sort of the medium-term outlook through the cycle expectation line for charge-offs is in the 40 to 70 basis point range. So, that\u2019s what we are setup for over the medium to long-term. So given that we are only half of the floor of that range right now, we will take the 21 basis points we have today is sustainable. Having said that, obviously, I don\u2019t think we are going to go from 20 to 40 in the quarter. But I do expect that as we go into 2016 and \u201817, we will probably see charge-offs start to move back up again into that range. I think one example to think about there to really bring it home is when you look at our C&I book. Today, we have got charge-offs in that book of less than 10 basis points, a single-digit basis points in a book where historically our average is more like 50 or 60. And so clearly in C&I, single-digit basis points won\u2019t be sustainable as the economy normalizes.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, John.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Just back to the loan growth real quick on the C&I side and sorry if you touched on this, but just wanted to get a little bit more color behind the decline in the C&I balances end of periods of what drove it? And what would your outlook be for C&I in coming quarters given what you are seeing in the markets in the Southeast?","Bill Rogers","Yes, that\u2019s sort of a quarter-to-quarter thing. I mean, we have had, in core areas, we have seen really good growth, healthcare, TMT, corporate banking, I mean, those numbers on an annualized basis are up 30 and plus kind of percent. So, we have got a lot of cylinders that are running at a high base. And then at others, we have just had some pay-downs. I mean, we have had sort of a significant level of pay-downs that have been maybe different than we have experienced in the past. And then as I said earlier, there is something that we just said on the margin that\u2019s just not really creating profitable value for us. So, we are just not going to play in that arena. So, I clearly think C&I will have positive growth. I mean, I think this is \u2013 it\u2019s a one quarter deal. Sort of over time, you have seen that. We have got 6% growth year-to-year based upon what I see with pipeline, based what I see in growth and unfunded commitments, based upon I see with new clients and all the things that are the health metrics of our business, I would expect C&I will continue to grow, but it will just be on a quarter-by-quarter basis based on sort of the same kind of example, we will look at each individual business within that and sort of make determinations. But I don\u2019t think we are in a flat environment in C&I growth maybe that\u2019s the best way to summarize that. We will grow over time.","John Pancari","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. The pay-downs is that \u2013 what parts of C&I are you seeing that more concentrated in?","Bill Rogers","Yes, we have seen that in a couple of different areas. We have seen in our asset securitization area as a good example where we have had significant pay-downs. Clearly, on the CRE, we have seen significant pay-downs in that and most of those are positive. They are refinancing. There are companies that have moved to investment grade. So, they are paying down their loans. Their company is on the CRE side that they are moving out of the construction phase much faster. So, the quality of what we are doing is supporting it. So, it\u2019s not pay-downs that we are viewing is sort of a negative correlation, it\u2019s sort of positive. So, it\u2019s a number of different places.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly just wanted to get color on the non-interest bearing deposit balance and again sorry, if you already touched on this, I missed a part of the call, but I know the non-interest bearing balances were down 3% linked quarter and year-over-year as well. So, just want to get some color on what drove that?","Bill Rogers","Well, I think that\u2019s just a reflection of client behavior and client needs. It looks like clients are looking for liquidity. They want daily liquidity. And as they grow balances in each of their accounts, we have had this history of client behavior over the last several years where in order to avoid fees on their accounts and manage their money better our clients are consolidating accounts and keeping more dollars in each of their accounts. And as they are doing that, they are starting to move into accounts that give them daily liquidity as well as the opportunity to earn something. So, I think that\u2019s just a reflection of client behavior.","John Pancari","Got it. Alright, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from John McDonald of Bernstein.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Wondering if you could explain what drives the premium amortization income? What led to the decline this quarter, Aleem? And did you mention how much that contributed to the NIM expansion this quarter?","Aleem Gillani","John, I didn\u2019t mention it, but premium amortization this quarter declined by about $15 million and what drove that mostly was some remixing we did within our securities portfolio at the start of Q2 and that helped a little bit in Q2 and it helped more in Q3. At this kind of level, I would expect general stability in premium amortization. As I said, it improved by $15 million from Q2. Just so you have the number in your head, the actual amortization in Q3 was $45 million and I would expect as long as sort of rates are generally here to sit within that $40 million to $50 million range in amortization.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks. And then just a bigger picture follow-up, you guys have been executing really well. Your ROA the last nine months has been about 1%. You have got an ROTCE to about 12%, just under 12%. What are your longer term goals, Bill, in terms of where you think the ROA and ROTCE should be for this company as you think out of few years?","Bill Rogers","Yes, we have been careful about not having a specific external goal, but clearly, I think over time, we are a north of 1% ROA company. That will actually be increasingly hard in the short-term. So, that\u2019s going to \u2013 the degree of difficulty actually is going to change in the short-term on that. But I think what you are seeing is that we have got the kind of company that\u2019s got the ability to be north of 1% ROA. And then on the ROTCE, similarly, I mean, I think sort of continue to sort of ratchet up as we think about where we need to be. Can you get back to those lofty numbers of 15%? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a lot of rate dependencies sort of pre-crisis dependencies on those. But I do think we have got we are going to continue to ratchet up even in this environment.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Aleem Gillani","And John if I take sort of a longer term view of your question, if I think back pre-crisis, SunTrust was sort of averaging ROA of about 1.2%. So, I see no reason why over the long-term we can\u2019t be a 1.2% plus ROA company.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Wanted to ask you two questions, one is on the capital markets activities, you gave about $50 million, a little bit more than $50 million this quarter. I am just curious if all the uncertainty and disruptions in the marketplace if you didn\u2019t see some embedded activities or possible revenues as you move forward kind of stuck up in the pipelines out there in those businesses?","Bill Rogers","Yes. There is clearly some of that, Marty. But let\u2019s keep in mind we are also year-to-year up 30%. And we had an unbelievably great second quarter. So part of the give up is we are just coming off a great second quarter. We had a lot of the things in the part of the business that are I would consider to be core like syndications held up well. M&A had another really good quarter and pipelines are still good there. The volatility numbers are in sort of high yield bonds and the equity sales and trading and that\u2019s better. Spreads have come in. I think things will get done more this quarter than they did last quarter if things stay stable. And based upon what I see in terms of our pipeline, I feel good about our pipeline. And I feel good about our pipeline again particularly in those sort of core areas. So what we saw in the decrease I saw was primarily related to specific volatility rather than any sort of chink in our strategy. And then as you highlighted it also creates opportunity and creates opportunity for a bank like ours.","Marty Mosby","Aleem, I have got a tougher question for you and the sense of\u2026","Aleem Gillani","Good, well, Marty why are saving the tough one for me.","Marty Mosby","When you look at the mortgage portfolio, you had to work hard with a lot of pain to allow for potential losses that were weighted to the big event that we had in the financial crisis and the unusual losses that we had in the portfolio. Now that we are on the backside of that and we have changed all the underwriting and now we are looking at a portfolio that\u2019s going to perform more like it did historically with very low losses expected for the foreseeable future without the risk of those big kind of spikes up, how do you think about allowing for that, because you are releasing reserves, but you had to put away a lot and should probably look at further benefits from that as you move forward?","Aleem Gillani","Well, that is a great question actually Marty. If you would look at the mortgage segment slide that we have got in the deck, you do see we are actually releasing reserves. We have got a negative provision in that book this quarter. And as you look around the rest of the industry, you see I think kind of the same thing with the mortgage books and sort of home equity books generally looking better and better every quarter that we get away from the crisis with a lot of those reserves that have been set aside for those books starting to become apparently no longer required. And as that becomes more and more apparent over time, it\u2019s possible as you say, that we will continue to require fewer reserves for that book and you could see negative provisioning against that. However, against that if I think about the C&I book and my comments earlier about C&I charge-offs being at extremely low levels, I do expect that we will see increased charge-off and reserving required in C&I over time and to some extent that ought to offset the benefits that we are getting on the mortgage side.","Marty Mosby","Appreciate it. Just over time can be defined in different ways and been in periods where you had very low losses, especially in C&I books for not quarters but years and so you may not see the timing of that if you don\u2019t have event like energy to offset it going forward?","Aleem Gillani","Let\u2019s see, Marty if that happens. We will be happy.","Marty Mosby","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Matt.","Bill Rogers","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Bill, you have been talking about preferring to invest in SunTrust given the big opportunity organically versus doing deals, but I am wondering, with the combination of the improvement you have had on your expense base, ROA on the balance sheet optimization and then sort of macro factors out there in terms of both lower rates and likely slower growth for some time, is that thought process changing to where you may be more open to M&A and if not what needs to happen to be more a little more constructive on doing deals?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I mean I think you have quoted me accurately, which I appreciated. And I still think the best opportunity is within SunTrust in terms of where I see the investment. And I still think we have significant opportunity for growth. And I also think we have efficiency opportunity. So I don\u2019t think we sort of run the string all the way out there that we are sort of looking for the next thing. All that being said, to the extent that we did get involved in anything it would be likely to be smaller fill in that would complement an existing line of the business or a product gap or something where we just saw we had a chance to enhance what we are doing rather than any large scale M&A.","Matt O'Connor","And would that apply just to key businesses or some openness in terms of geographic fill in bank deals as well?","Bill Rogers","Yes. I mean if there was something interesting, I mean obviously on the geographic side, a lot of things that we would do, would dilute our franchise. And we want to make sure that we don\u2019t do anything geographically that dilutes the opportunities we see. I mean we have got states like Florida and North Carolina and Georgia, which are three of the top then job growth states in the country right now. So we are in a lot of the right places where we want to be for the next phase. So again, it could be I am not limiting that to fee business, but again if it were it would be fill in and not large scale at this point.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","Angela, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Aleem, can you come back to the C&I portfolio, you were saying that you are seeing some firming in pricing in the last month or two, can you give us some color where you are seeing that and what you think is causing it?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. Gerard I think what we are seeing there is that as you know over a long period of time, the loans that we have been putting on have been at lower yields than the loans that we have had that have been rolling off or paying down. And I think that that long-term several year consistent trend is starting to ease, partially because our overall portfolio yields are moving down. And so we are at a place now with the loans that are coming on are not as much lower in yield terms as they loans that are rolling off. So while there are still lower, I want to be clear about that, they are not as much lower and sort of that kind of firming is helping our overall portfolio. I think also we have been pretty explicit about trying to make sure that where we are not getting the returns that we expect to get, where we are being very careful about those relationships and managing our balance sheet as a precious resource. I think our teammates are very focused on that and so if we are not getting the returns we are sort of trying not to do that kind of business.","Bill Rogers","Yes. I would say we wouldn\u2019t want to underplay or overplay that comment. It just is a \u2013 it\u2019s a reversal of a trend. So it\u2019s not as important to discuss that, that in this quarter, we saw some difference in that trend. I think as Aleem said, it\u2019s probably some combination of our own discipline and selection process at some combination of portfolio mix and probably some market issue, some widening bond spreads and sort of how do they reflect in terms of what we see in terms of production.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. And then as a follow-up, I think everybody in the call agrees with you about the outlook for credit, it\u2019s been great for you and the industry. And then question is on the C&I portfolio, Aleem you talked about I think the charge-offs now down to 10 basis points and over time you think they will go back up to a more normal number, 50 to 60. And the question is, is it so good today because of some ultraconservative underwriting standards you guys had 3 years or 4 years ago or \u2013 and then as we go into the future we head into a recession and that pushes it up, what\u2019s going to be the driver behind the normalization of credit losses?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Gerard I don\u2019t know that our \u2013 I would characterize our underwriting standards as ultraconservative. I think we play in a market along with many other competitors and that market is what it is. However, I think that as a country, as an economy overall, we have all benefited from the increased liquidity that many corporations and increased capital that many corporations have placed within their companies and their portfolios. I think one of the other benefits also that you see for SunTrust and perhaps for the industry overall is the benefit of CCAR. The CCAR has changed the way that companies think about their overall risk. They apply a stress test to all their portfolios now and think about how portfolios would behave during a stress test. One of the benefits for SunTrust specifically is how good we look in CCAR. We are a top decile performer. We have managed our portfolio very carefully and that\u2019s what\u2019s helping our particular charge-off numbers right now look as good as they do.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you for this insight.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Ankur Vyas","","Thanks, Christine. Good morning, and welcome to our third-quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during the call. The press release, presentation, and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website, investors.suntrust.com.","Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","","Thanks, Ankur. As usual, I'll begin this morning with a brief overview of the quarter, and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Aleem for details on the results. So, following Aleem\u2019s comments, I'll wrap up our prepared remarks by reviewing our performance at the business segment level.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.06 on net income to common of $563 million. However, as previously disclosed, we recognized $130 million discrete tax benefit, which we returned to shareholders through a one-time share buyback. Excluding this gain, earnings per share were $0.81 on net income to common of $433 million.","Our adjusted results were in line with the previous quarter and up 23% from last year, reflecting solid loan and deposit growth, further efficiency improvements, and continued strong asset quality performance, all of which helped mitigate the impact of the persistent low rate environment.","Our adjusted revenue was up 3% year-over-year, but declined 3% from last quarter. The sequential decline was primarily a result of our investment banking business rolling off record results in the second quarter and the loss of some investment management income due to the sale of RidgeWorth.","Net interest income was generally stable relative to both periods as solid loan growth mitigated spread compression. With regard to non-interest income, as we said before, several of our fee-oriented businesses are subject to some seasonality. With that in mind, I believe our year-to-date fee income performance tells a more accurate story of how we\u2019ve been able to leverage our investment to these businesses to drive more consistent execution and deepen client relationships.","Our non-interest income, excluding the impact from RidgeWorth and mortgage-related revenues, was up 7% year-to-date with meaningful improvement in investment banking, retail investment services and traditional private wealth. These positive trends combined with higher mortgage service and income helped offset the 60% year-to-date decline in core mortgage production related fees.","Expenses declined relative to both periods, previous quarter and the prior year, and notably, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 61.9% for the quarter. That brings our year-to-date ratio to 63.5% and keeps us on clear track to deliver on our 2014 sub-64% efficiency ratio commitment.","Our performance this quarter demonstrates our continued focus on efficiency improvement, and importantly, our steady progress towards our long-term target is evidence of our methodical transformation to a more efficiency conscious culture across the company.","So, looking at the balance sheet, period-end loan balances increased 2% sequentially led by growth in C&I, traditional CRE, and our consumer direct portfolio. However, average performing loans were flat as a result of the $2 billion guaranteed residential mortgage loan sale this quarter.","Average client deposits grew 1% relative to last quarter with favorable mix shift continuing. We\u2019ve built positive and broad-based momentum across our lending platforms and are focused on ensuring our deposit growth keeps pace.","Our credit quality performance continues to be strong, and in the quarter we were able to further improve the overall asset quality of the balance sheet through targeted non-performing asset reductions. As a result, NPLs declined 15% sequentially and net charge-offs ticked up slightly to 39 basis points.","Finally, our capital position continues to be strong and was relatively unchanged from last quarter with Tier 1 Common estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III basis.","So with that as a quick overview, I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more detail on the results.","Aleem Gillani","","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. We\u2019re glad you are able to join us at our slightly later start time this morning, and we are pleased to be able to accommodate those of you who needed to watch Thursday Night Football last night.","Earnings per share this quarter were $1.06, and included in that result is a $0.25 benefit that we recognized upon the completion of a tax authority exempt. Excluding the impact of this benefit, adjusted earnings per share were $0.81, which was in line with the previous quarter and 23% higher than the third quarter of last year. ","The year-over-year increase was driven by 3% adjusted revenue growth as a result of higher mortgage servicing income, a gain on sale of mortgage loans, which I will discuss later, and slightly higher net interest income. A 3% reduction in adjusted expenses also contributed to the year-over-year improvement as we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives and benefited from lower cyclical costs. These positive trends more than offset the $45 million year-over-year decline in trust and investment management income resulting from the sale of RidgeWorth.","Sequentially, earnings per share were flat as the decline in non-interest income and modestly higher provision expense were offset by a 5% reduction in adjusted expenses. Lastly, adjusted year-to-date earnings are up 19% compared to the previous year. A solid balance sheet and fee income growth, lower expenses, and improved asset quality have more than offset the $205 million reduction in core mortgage production income and 14 basis point net interest margin compression during that same time frame.","We\u2019ll now review the underlying trends in more detail starting on slide 5. Net interest income was generally stable relative to the prior quarter and prior year as loan growth negated loan yield compression. Net interest margin declined 8 basis points sequentially primarily due to a 7 basis point decline in loan yields. The decline in loan yields was most notable in our C&I book though we also felt this to a lesser degree in our commercial real estate and indirect auto portfolios.","The drivers of our loan yield compression are mix shift as wholesale is growing at a faster rate than the rest of the portfolio, and continued competition in our markets and businesses. While loan yields in the wholesale segment are typically lower, C&I business often brings with it additional non-interest income and deposit revenue. Our intent is to meet the full suite of our clients\u2019 needs and maintain a disciplined focus on entire relationship returns.","Securities yields declined 9 basis points sequentially, primarily due to higher prepayments as MBS cash flows increased into our investment portfolio. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was relatively flat as solid 6% earning asset growth neutralized the 16 basis points of margin compression.","Overall, the net interest margin has declined in 2014 more than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. As commercial loan growth has been stronger than expected and yields continue to compress. Looking forward, we expect fourth quarter net interest margins to decline approximately 3 to 6 basis points from the current level primarily driven by lower commercial loan swap income.","We have been and will continue to carefully manage our overall balance sheet duration and utilization in light of the continued low interest rate environment while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk in advance of what we expect will eventually be higher interest rate.","Moving on to slide 6, adjusted non-interest income declined $72 million from the prior quarter driven primarily by lower investment banking income and the loss of investment management income from RidgeWorth.","Investment banking declined due to the strong performance in the prior quarter, seasonally lower client activity this quarter, and transaction timing. Year-to-date investment banking income is up 14% with syndicated finance, M&A, and equity offerings being the primary drivers of growth.","Trust and investment management income was down $23 million sequentially, however, RidgeWorth represented $31 million of the decline. And our core private wealth business grew $8 million.","Mortgage production income was down $7 million quarter-over-quarter as gain on sale margins declined slightly. Closed loan production increased 11% while applications declined 4%, reflecting the return to more normal seasonal patterns in the mortgage business.","Retail investment services and card fees continue to be on a positive track as the result of our ongoing focus on meeting more clients\u2019 needs. In addition, service charges for deposits increased $9 million, partially driven by seasonal trends.","Other non-interest income, excluding the gain on sale of RidgeWorth, declined $13 million as a $41 million gain related to the $2 billion sale of government guaranteed mortgages was negated by a $49 million impairment of a leasing portfolio due to market-driven declines in residual values of certain assets.","Lastly, we incurred $9 million of net securities losses in the quarter due to a minor repositioning of the investment portfolio.","Compared to the third quarter of last year, adjusted non-interest income increased $40 million driven by higher mortgage servicing income.","Finally, to echo Bill\u2019s previous comment, year-to-date non-interest income, ex RidgeWorth and mortgage-related revenues, was up 7% year-over-year, which reflects the positive momentum we are creating in our CIB business, as well as retail investment services, core private wealth, and credit card.","Moving on to expenses, adjusted non-interest expense declined $71 million or 5% relative to the prior quarter. Personnel expense was down $33 million sequentially, driven by the sale of RidgeWorth, a reduction in FTEs and lower benefits costs. In addition, other non-interest expense declined by $36 million, in part due to severance and other costs in the prior quarter.","Adjusted cyclical costs declined $13 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by lower operating losses, which, as you know, can be highly variable. Going forward, we do not anticipate cyclical costs to be a meaningful driver of changes in our expense base with the exception of occasional volatility in operating losses.","Compared to the prior year, adjusted non-interest expense was down $44 million or 3%, driven by lower cyclical costs and broad-based reductions across most expense categories as a result of ongoing efficiency initiatives. These reductions were partially offset by higher personnel expenses due primarily to an incentive accrual reduction booked in the third quarter of last year.","As you can see on slide 8, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio improved to 61.9% from 63.6% in the prior quarter as the $71 million decline in adjusted expenses offset the sequential revenue decline. This brings our year-to-date adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to 63.5%, a full 150 basis points lower than the same period last year despite an approximately $200 million decline in core mortgage production income.","We are on track to meet our commitment to an efficiency ratio of better than 64% for the full-year 2014, and we continue to make progress toward our long-term target of sub-60%.","Turning to asset quality on slide 9, our credit quality performance has been strong and we took proactive steps to make even further improvements in the third quarter. Non-performing loans declined 15% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, driven primarily by targeted reductions in the residential loan portfolio. We took a small additional charge-off and moved $53 million of non-performing mortgage loans to held-for-sale status in anticipation of a sale in the fourth quarter.","Despite the substantial 15% reduction in the non-performing loan portfolio, the net charge-off ratio increased only modestly to 39 basis points, reflective of continued strong core performance within the loan portfolio. The improvements in asset quality led to a $35 million decline in the allowance and 6 basis point reduction in the allowance ratio while the provision expense increased $20 million sequentially given the modest increase in net charge-offs.","Over the near term, we expect further though moderating declines in non-performing loans primarily driven by the residential portfolio. We also expect our loan loss provision expense to be fairly stable over the next few quarters, in line with our results for the past five quarters as continued strong asset quality may offset positive loan growth. However, as you all are well aware, the ultimate level of reserves and provision expense will be determined by future economic conditions and our rigorous quarterly review processing.","Turning to balance sheet trends on slide 10, period-end loan growth was up 2% sequentially. We view the period-end comparison as a more accurate picture of our core loan growth in the quarter as it removes the impact of the $2 billion loan transferred to held-for-sale last quarter. Growth was driven by the C&I, CRE and consumer portfolios, and was partially offset by a slight decline in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios.","C&I loan growth was broad based and driven by not-for-profit and government clients alongside increases across almost all CIB industry verticals. CRE momentum continued this quarter due to growth in our institutional business, success in our REIT platform and a small portfolio acquisition.","Consumer loans were also up nicely given growth in our consumer direct, indirect and credit card portfolios. We are pleased with our progress this quarter and believe that it\u2019s consistent with our multi-year effort to optimize the balance sheet and add diversification by growing high-quality commercial and consumer loans.","During the quarter, we completed the $2 billion government guaranteed residential mortgage loan sale and recorded a corresponding $41 million pre-tax gain. The proceeds of the sale were reinvested into level-one high-quality liquid securities to help us meet the liquidity coverage ratio requirements. As of September 30, our liquidity coverage ratio already surpasses the January 1, 2016 90% requirement. Therefore, we expect any further actions we take regarding the LCR will not be material to our earnings or balance sheet profile.","On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans increased $8.3 billion or 7% driven by broad-based growth across most portfolios. This performance is reflective of our execution of certain growth initiatives alongside generally improving economic conditions in our markets.","Turning now to deposit performance, average client deposits were up approximately $2 billion or 1% compared to the prior quarter and 4% compared to the prior year as good growth and low cost deposits was partially offset by time deposit run-off. This continued favorable shift in the deposit mix helped reduce interest-bearing deposit costs by 2 and 6 basis points compared to the prior quarter and prior year, respectively.","Slide 12 provides an update on our capital position. Common Equity Tier 1 expanded by approximately $250 million as a result of growth in retained earnings while the estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio remained stable at 9.7%. Tangible book value per share increased 2% from the prior quarter and a full 11% compared to the prior year due to growth in retained earnings.","During the quarter, we purchased $215 million in common stock, which includes the $130 million one-time buyback we completed upon receiving a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. In addition, we anticipate repurchasing approximately $230 million of stock over the next two quarters.","Lastly, I\u2019d like to highlight the credit rating upgrade we received from Standard & Poor\u2019s this week, which acknowledged the actions we have taken as an organization to substantially improve our asset quality position, increase our capital ratios, and enhance our profitability profile over the last several years.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","Bill Rogers","","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. On a segment basis, we continue to make progress, balancing expense discipline with the opportunities to continue to invest for future growth. So go to slide 13, in our consumer and private wealth segment this quarter, we saw solid returns on our recent investments and continued to show good revenue momentum both in our wealth management and lending-related businesses.","Looking at the numbers, net income grew 17% sequentially, but was down 5% year-over-year as a result of higher provision and expenses. The combination of moderating asset quality improvement and incremental balance sheet growth drove the higher provision, and higher expense base reflected increased hiring related to revenue-generating positions in addition to elevated environmental operating losses.","Relative to both periods, continued revenue momentum was a key driver of our performance as revenues were up 3% sequentially and year-over-year. The growth was balanced between net interest income and fee income, the latter of which saw positive trends in trust and investment management, retail investment services and deposit fees.","Consumer loan production was up 23% year-over-year led by continued momentum in our consumer direct, credit card and indirect auto portfolios which more than offset the run-off in home equity and guaranteed student loans.","Our success in consumer direct and credit card in particular demonstrates our focus on driving growth in higher risk-adjusted return businesses. The growth in the consumer direct portfolio has been driven by distinct lending platforms we have developed that are efficient, high-end customer satisfaction and a good credit quality with average FICO scores north of 750.","Average client deposits were up 1% sequentially reflecting our enhanced focus on meeting more of our clients\u2019 deposit needs. We expect more recent investments in technology such as the digital banking platform and SummitView, our well-received financial planning and account aggregation tools to further improve our deposit gathering capabilities.","The big picture, we continue to focus on investing in digital, improving our deposit momentum and driving revenue growth opportunities to help offset headwinds associated with the prolonged low rate environment. Expense discipline, however, is also a key contributor to achieving our strategic objectives in this segment and we continue to balance cost reduction opportunities with prudent investments for further growth.","Our wholesale segment continues to be a key growth engine for the company and although there are a few puts and takes to the numbers this quarter, the core trends remained strong. Looking at the numbers on an adjusted basis, net income was up 5% sequentially and 23% year-over-year driven by continued revenue momentum and strong asset quality.","Adjusted revenue declined slightly from last quarter but grew 5% relative to the prior year. Net interest income was up relative to both periods driven by loan and deposit growth but this was partially offset by decline in loan yields. Non-interest income, particularly investment banking and trading income, accounted for the sequential decline as this business is subject to quarterly fluctuations based on transaction timings and market conditions.","On a year-to-date basis, investment banking income was up 14% and trading income was up 12%, reflecting the investments we\u2019ve made in talent and capabilities and our increasing market share. Average loan balances grew 4% from the prior quarter led by broad-based growth throughout wholesale\u2019s client segments, most notably, as Aleem noted, the energy practice group, not-for-profit and government group, and CRE.","In addition, we benefited from solid growth in our asset securitization and asset-based lending products and our national corporate banking expansion continue to gain traction. Loan yields remain under pressure, constraining our margin in this segment. However, as we\u2019ve said before, we take a holistic view of our client relationships with deposit and fee generation also playing a role in our risk-adjusted returns. And in that light, year-to-date deposits are up 10% and capital market related fee income is up 13%.","Across the platform, our markets remain competitive but our wholesale value proposition continues to be well received by clients. Where we choose to compete, we continue to win share. Lower loan yields will continue to be a challenge, and we\u2019re working hard to mitigate that impact by being more disciplined about utilization of the balance sheet in addition to continuing to expand our fee income and deposit opportunities, particularly with our commercial clients. So, looking forward, our investment banking backlog and lending pipelines are healthy and we remain bullish on the overall growth and profitability outlook for this segment.","Our mortgage segment continued to show steady progress quarter-to-quarter. This was the third consecutive quarter of core profitability for this segment with adjusted net income of $18 million, which was down sequentially due to lower production revenue and a gain-on-sale of loans in the prior quarter, along with higher charge-offs associated with the aforementioned targeted reductions in our NPL portfolio. A key driver of our improved profitability in this business has been strong expense discipline evidenced by an 11% sequential and a 34% year-over-year reduction in our core cost base. ","The revenue environment here remains challenging with industry origination volumes 15% lower than what, I think, we all expected at the beginning of the year and roughly 50% lower than the 10-year average prior to 2014. While the market is supported by good overall affordability, lower inventory levels, building activity and the amount of first-time home-buying continue to dampen total origination volumes. So for our part, we continue to invest and performing mortgage servicing as we both have the capability and capacity to grow this business.","In the quarter, we added approximately $4 billion to our servicing portfolio through a combination of outright purchases and agency loan production. Looking forward, we expect to settle and transfer approximately $10 billion of additional servicing over the coming couple of quarters.","In addition, I want to highlight our progress on the efficiency side as the mortgage segment has been a large hurdle in achieving our overall corporate efficiency goals. In the quarter, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved further to just over 70%, which is in stark contrast to previous years where the business was running well north of a 100%. Our steady progress reflects our strategy of carefully managing our expense base, improving our risk profile, particularly until the origination activity begins to normalize. ","So before I wrap up, I\u2019d like to give a brief mention of our announcement last month regarding the naming of the new ballpark for the Atlanta Braves, which is set to open in 2017. This is part of a mixed use year-round facility that will feature office, residential and retail development and it\u2019s a unique opportunity to improve our brand recognition both regionally and nationally.","So to summarize the quarter, our performance demonstrated solid momentum across each of our businesses with a mix of revenue momentum in certain areas combined with good expense discipline in others, the net of which was further improvement in our overall efficiency.","The economies in our markets continue to track positively and we\u2019re committed to investing in our teammates and businesses such that we\u2019re delivering on our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients, our communities, and our shareholders.","So with that said, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur, for Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","","Great. Christine, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I\u2019d like to ask all the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. You may ask your question.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Aleem, I just wonder if you could -- you guys had a great expense result this quarter, certainly helped by RidgeWorth. You had been talking about a 1.3, 1.4 type range. Certainly this number puts you below it from here. And Bill, I heard your point about getting below the 64% for the year, but just relative to that really good expense print and then expectations going forward, are we in a new range or was this an anomaly?","Bill Rogers","","I think it\u2019s a little bit of both, Ken. This is a little bit of an anomaly which sort of demonstrates how we\u2019re working hard to make sure that we really improve the overall efficiency ratio of the company. If you think about quarters where we\u2019ve had revenue growth, you\u2019ve seen some expense growth. In the quarter now where you saw some revenue decline, you saw an expense decline. Now, it won\u2019t always track that way. We can\u2019t guarantee a 100% correlation, but in general, we\u2019re really trying to pull the levers we think are appropriate to match the opportunities that we see in our markets.","Having said that, I do think that the 1.3 to 1.4 range that I had referenced in the past, I could probably tighten that up a little bit, I\u2019d probably start thinking about that next year as perhaps in the 1.3 to 1.35 range, bring that top-end down a little as the expense efforts that we\u2019ve been working on over the last several years are actually paying off.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","","Okay, and my follow-up just then, so in the third quarter itself, the seasonal declines off of investment banking, what points would you make that were kind of better than normal I guess would be the question?","Bill Rogers","","If you are talking about investment banking, I would think about the third quarter as being sort of typically a lighter quarter in investment banking anyway, and we did see some transactions move timing from third quarter to fourth quarter. As we think about investment banking now looking at the fourth quarter, we\u2019re feeling pretty good.","Our pipeline right now was looking pretty strong. I\u2019m not really sure what any actions would result as a result of this week\u2019s market actions, but coming into this week, I think we\u2019re feeling pretty good about how the fourth quarter is going to look for that business.","Operator","","The next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","","Just on the topic of loan growth, yours remains pretty good versus peers and I guess I'm looking at the year-over-year and thinking about ex some of the sales you had running maybe around 8%. Some of your peers have talked about pulling back a bit just as pricing has compressed and some areas like leverage lending may not be as appealing as it was before. So just your thoughts on the competitive landscape and do you think you can continue to outgrow the overall industry going forward?","Bill Rogers","","Matt, we\u2019ve seen good opportunities which I think are reflective of a number of things. One is various investments that we\u2019ve made in our business and the capacity that we\u2019ve built ranging from industry verticals to national corporate expansion to CRE. Our markets, regional markets, I think, are performing better. So I think that\u2019s somewhat reflective also of what\u2019s happening.","We\u2019ve got capacity in areas like CRE where we started from a much smaller base, so we\u2019ve got capacity to grow in that business. I would say similarly to what others have said, as you know, we\u2019re going to be cautious and smart and where we see deals that don\u2019t make sense, we\u2019re certainly backing away from. ","But we\u2019ve also built a lot of fee-generating capabilities such that on a deal-by-deal basis, we may be able to rate rock a little bit better because we\u2019ve got an ability to put more fees over that opportunity and as you continue to see our improving return, we\u2019re going to want to keep a high focus on that.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then just separately, as we think about the net interest margin beyond the fourth quarter, there were some disclosures in the appendix on the swap income being higher than what you had disclosed I think last quarter. Of course, loan spreads I think are directionally still coming in and rates are an unknown. Just any thoughts on where the NIM might bottom as we look out beyond 4Q?","Aleem Gillani","","Yes, Matt. If I think about what 2015 might look like, and given what we\u2019ve seen in the markets so far, it\u2019s a little early to say for all of \u201915, but as a general range, if I think about where 2015 might go on NIM, I\u2019d be thinking about it perhaps full-year NIM on the order of 290 plus or minus with some risks and opportunities on either side of that depending on commercial loan spread compression, how the interest rate environment does overall, what the Fed decides to do, and of course what we do in terms of swaps and I\u2019ll remind you on swaps, all these are are turning floating rate loans into fixed-rate loans. So that\u2019s all they do, and we generate new floating rate loans every quarter.","So, in the context of the overall macroeconomic environment as we\u2019re thinking about our balance sheet duration, if we have certain duration targets, we\u2019ll be needing to put some swaps on every quarter just to match the new floating rate loans that are coming on.","So, you\u2019ve seen us take actions in the past several quarters on that book. I wouldn\u2019t really think about that book as being a thing by itself, NII by itself. It really - the swap activities that we have are just in order to use derivative products to manage our overall interest rate risk profile and the duration of our balance sheet and the actions that we\u2019ve taken have helped to grow NII and as long as we continue to get loan growth, we\u2019ll continue to be doing more of that.","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","","And the 290 thought for the full year on average, would that include any impact from higher short-term interest rates?","Aleem Gillani","","Actually, our forecast right now, Matt, is that we won\u2019t get a short-term rate increase in 2015. We\u2019ve been thinking that for a little while with our anticipated first rate rise coming in early \u201916 and we continue to have that view.","Operator","","The next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","","Just as a follow-up to that question, can you maybe run us through the changes that you made to the swap portfolio, how does it change the maturity profile, what does it do to the rate sensitivity and how far does the duration extend beyond 2015?","Aleem Gillani","","Yes, Ryan, the new swaps that we\u2019ve put on in the quarter again were done essentially to match what we\u2019re seeing in our commercial loan book and we added a few billion dollars of sort of three and four year swaps. It doesn\u2019t really change the duration profile of the swap book much.","If you think about our overall swap book, we had a duration there in that three to four year range anyway. So it doesn\u2019t change the profile there, and it had the effect of adding sort of $10 million to $12 million or so per quarter in net interest income starting in 2015, starting in Q1 2015.","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","","Got it. And then maybe for Bill, when I think about the progress that you guys have made on the efficiency ratio, so you're below 62% for this quarter. You've added some swaps to reduce some of the NII headwind that you have as you move into next year. So I guess you guys have obviously committed to having continued improvement, but I'm just trying to think about the magnitude. I know there are some puts and takes on a quarterly basis, but can we think about this as a good starting point for 2015 or is there too much seasonality in the business that we should think about more as a year-over-year change?","Bill Rogers","","I think there is too much seasonality to sort of pick one quarter a high or low and say that\u2019s the starting point for future. We\u2019re averaging 63.5% for the year. I\u2019m confident and barring anything crazy and [indiscernible] got you rethinking about anything crazy, but I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll be under 64% for the year, and we\u2019ll, as the end of the year progresses and we start to think about next year, we\u2019ll give more guidance as to the efficiency ratio for 2015 but suffice it to say it will be below 64%. So we\u2019re going to continue to trend down, that\u2019s the commitment we\u2019ve made.","The speed at which we commit to trend down will be dependent upon a lot of things, not the least of which is interest rate environment and our expectations of an interest rate increase on the short-term side, but the net is we\u2019re going to continue to, on average, trend down.","Operator","","The next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Hey, I just wanted to dig in a little bit into the expansion that you've been announcing and executing on recently in the commercial space, Chicago, Boston, Dallas, et cetera. Get a sense as to, A, how you are finding it. I know it's small dollars, but just wanted to get a sense of that, what else is on the docket to expand and how those expansions have been doing relative to plan in terms of revenue growth, et cetera?","Bill Rogers","","I think you accurately pointed sort of small now, but relative to plan we\u2019re tracking ahead of where we were relative to plan. A couple of banks I\u2019ve been really pleased with the quality of the talent that we\u2019ve been able to attract for those offices. So it\u2019s a good confirmation that people like our platform, they like what we\u2019re doing and they want to be a part of it. So that is probably maybe exceeded my expectations and they were really high to start with.","In terms of the business that we\u2019re attracting, similarly I think we\u2019ve been real pleased with the quality of what we\u2019re putting on. As you said, it will sort of start slower, it will tend to be -- start a little more asset side and then fee income will follow so that will be a sequence, that will be pretty natural in that progress. But everything we\u2019re seeing to-date, I feel good about and we\u2019re tracking ahead of where we thought we were internally both from a talent side, asset growth side, and most importantly, returns side.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","And how are you getting into the new clients? I mean obviously assets first. So maybe you could speak to the pricing versus structure type of debate that's out there.","Bill Rogers","","I think we\u2019re leading with advice, so we\u2019re leading with advice and knowledge, and we\u2019re not leading with pricing and structure. Price and structure is somewhat market dependent, but we\u2019re leading with advice, and so the way we\u2019re getting into clients and attracting new situations is bring in the knowledge base that we\u2019ve developed from our industry verticals, the product capacity that we\u2019ve developed on our platform and adding an additional bank to situations. We\u2019re not always starting on the left side. You\u2019re going to start on the right side and work your way to the left. But it\u2019s really leading with advice and skill versus price and structure.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Can I just ask one bigger picture follow-up, is energy -- energy industry has been an important driver of CapEx spend in the U.S. obviously and in some of the institutions, loan growth in C&I and\/or sometimes in CRE, but I just wanted to get a sense with oil now priced where it is, do you see any potential pullback in that and if so, if there are other industries that you see an opportunity for expansion of things like CapEx?","Bill Rogers","","I mean that\u2019s clearly one that we\u2019re watching. The good news is that energy has been a good part of our growth but it\u2019s not sort of the only part of our growth. This quarter actually was quite good on the energy side, but it\u2019s one that we\u2019re going to watch and be careful about and the pundits are sort of all over the place on how much additional capital will be there, but our portfolio is good so I feel positive about that where we are. Might it have slower growth in the next several quarters relative to last few quarters possibly, but that\u2019s not sort of the only driver for us.","And the fee income side, I view this as potential. I mean anytime you have little volatility, I think if you are on the advice business, you\u2019ve got more opportunities on the fee side.","Aleem Gillani","","Betsy, I think there is a little geopolitical aspect to this also as center of energy production in the world moves from the Middle East into the U.S., we\u2019re poised well to be able to take advantage of that and we continue to have optimism about the energy sector overall.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","","Okay, no, that's helpful. Just interesting, as the breakeven points come down, just wondering if you're seeing any pullback near term on reinvestment, but it sounds like at this stage not. So I appreciate the color.","Bill Rogers","","I think it\u2019s too early to tell right now.","Operator","","The next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. You may ask your question.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","","I want to see if you could give us more color on the other expense line in the third quarter, just how we should think about that. It pulled back pretty materially here and I know you had cited some discretionary items that drove that. So, I wanted to get an idea about could that balance or could that line item spring back next quarter just given the volatility of the items involved? Thanks.","Aleem Gillani","","John, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d use the word spring back, but I do think that we had a couple of items in Q2 that make the Q3 number look like it\u2019s dropped off. We did have a couple of discretionary items that showed up in Q2.","Having said that, I would expect, as I think about next year, assuming revenue stays above where it is that we would see expenses in that sort of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion range. If revenue falls, we\u2019ll be pulling on expense levers to maintain efficiency, and if revenue goes up, then you might us - we might see expenses moving up towards the top end of that range, but as sort of a rough guidance for a range, I would think $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion looks right now for me to be a fair number for quarterly expenses next year.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","","Okay, all right. And then on that point, can you just give us a little bit of detail on the expected impact to your pension expense for 2015 if rates remain where they are currently?","Aleem Gillani","","Our pension expense is actually right now negative because we\u2019re running a fully-funded pension plan. So we happen to be in relatively good shape relative to, I think, the industry and Corporate America overall. I would expect, if yields drop, that you might see that the benefit we get from the plan come off a little and remember that our plan overall was frozen. So, given the frozen plan we\u2019re running, we\u2019re a little bit less sensitive to rates overall than perhaps others you would see.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","","Okay, all right. And then one last very quick one. I wanted to see if you can give us the amount of loans currently tied up in the MetLife JV that you initiated last year and what are the current yields in that portfolio?","Aleem Gillani","","The total amount of loans that we\u2019ve got is in the sort of $600 million to $700 million range, and I don\u2019t have a yield number off the top of my head, but I would think about that whole structure as being not just yield driven, but also giving us the opportunity to talk with those clients, provide them expertise and start to incorporate those clients into our overall capital markets activities and help them in other parts of their requirements besides just providing funding.","Bill Rogers","","I think just to talk about that as a percent of our portfolio, it\u2019s a small percent of portfolio. This was an important relationship to add diversity both geographic and product to our portfolio. These are very, very high quality, lower ROA absolutely than the balance of our portfolio, but the balance of our portfolio combined with this is tracking to be accretive to our ROA objectives.","Operator","","The next question comes from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","","So thanks for the color on sort of the tough mortgage revenue environment. However, a few of your peers have started to talk about just in the few days a pickup in refi applications and I was wondering if you could help us get a sense on what the upside to price could be to your production income if rates do stay this low through the end of the year?","Bill Rogers","","Yes, Erika, one robin doesn\u2019t make a spring category. The last two days have been really good. Our locked volume and app volume was up 80% in two days, so very significant. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to continue. I think we\u2019ll have to sort of see things settle out a little bit, but I think you are accurate in pointing out that the risk is to the upside and how significant that upside will be.","I\u2019m not ready to quantify at this point. So we\u2019ve got a couple of weeks under our belt and we are starting to see some normal activity, but certainly the early couple of days were really positive reads in the way that you\u2019d expect. Will this be refinanced boomlet? I don\u2019t know. Certainly a lot more conversation, we\u2019ll look at our portfolio, we\u2019ll determine how much marketing we want to do and how much spreads you have between what\u2019s in the portfolio and where current rates are, and I think we\u2019ve got good math and good diagnostics around that and we\u2019ll figure it out. But I think the risk is to the upside, but I\u2019m not sort of ready to commit to what that is yet till we get into a little bit more.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","","And my second question is just a quick follow-up. On slide 19, thank you for providing us the swap schedule. I just wanted to ask a couple of things. One is that I assume that also includes the swaps that were recently put on in terms of your quarterly average four count for 2015 and as we think about how that tracks on a quarterly basis, is it $50 million each quarter or is there sort of more significant drop-offs that we should consider as we think about the quarterly earnings trajectory for next year?","Aleem Gillani","","Erika, that number does include all of our actions through the end of the quarter, through the end of the third quarter, and $50 million as a quarterly average is sort of roughly stable. So not exactly, you\u2019ve got a few million swing here between one quarter and the next, but $50 million on average is a good and rough stable number for now.","Again, I would remind you we\u2019ve taken actions every quarter. If you go back and look at this slide for the last several quarters, you see that number going up consistently quarter after quarter. So, as long as we see opportunities and we continue to grow corporate lending, we will be required to add a few more swaps just in order to manage within our overall duration requirements set by our asset liability committee.","","Operator","","The next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. You may ask your question.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","","Hi, going back to efficiency, how much does the run-off of the swap portfolio hurt the efficiency ratio next year? And what I'm trying to get to is, if you take your $1.3 billion, $1.35 billion quarterly expense guidance off of this quarter's revenues of $2 billion, 1.3 billion times divided by 2 billion is a 64% efficiency ratio implied and if you take the higher end of your guidance, 1.35 billion, that's a 66% efficiency ratio based solely on this quarter's revenue. So that guidance implies 64% to 66% based on the quarter, but you said it should be lower than 64% next year. I just want to make sure I understand how you're thinking about this. And one other follow-up, you were at 62% this quarter and you're saying you'll be below 64% next year. So I just don't want to get too excited about the linked-quarter efficiency improvement if your guidance is for it to back up a little bit.","Aleem Gillani","","Thank you, Mike. I appreciate you not getting too excited about one quarter. One quarter really isn\u2019t - any one quarter no matter whether it\u2019s good or bad, really isn\u2019t telling about sort of overall trends. However, you\u2019ll recall at the start of this year in January when we gave guidance on efficiency ratio for this year and we said it would be below 64%, there was a little skepticism out there that we\u2019d be able to achieve that.","We\u2019ve worked hard. We\u2019ve done what we can on revenues. We\u2019ve done what we can with clients. We\u2019ve done what we can with expenses in order to achieve the number we committed to for this year and right now we think we\u2019re on track to achieve the below-64% for this year. As we get to next year, we\u2019ll set guidance for next year and our trend has been and our objective has been to continue to improve.","So, as we develop, what we think, a good forecast is for next year, we\u2019ll give you guidance in January as to what we think the efficiency ratio target for us ought to be next year, what we ought to be held accountable to and we\u2019ll try to make that a more efficient target than we have this year and I would look for us to try to continue to improve this over time.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","","We look forward to the fourth-quarter guidance. One follow-up, one real simple question, even with the headwind from the run-off of the swap revenues, do you think that the efficiency in 2015 can be better than it is in 2014?","Aleem Gillani","","Today, if you are asking me for a yes or no answer, might be my answer will have to be yes. I think we can continue to make SunTrust a more efficient company over time.","Bill Rogers","","Mike, to confirm, two yeses on that, make sure I pile in on that, but that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s not going to be hard. This is a grind and this is lots of, at this point, pennies and nickels on the revenue side, pennies and nickels on the expense side, and a complete grind, but the objective, as we sit here right now, is for 2015 to be lower than 2014.","Aleem Gillani","","And Mike you pointed out it\u2019s a $200 million revenue headwind we\u2019re facing next year. So, that\u2019s going to require us to work really hard to achieve that new target.","Bill Rogers","","And in fairness, that\u2019s about equal to the revenue headwind we faced in mortgage in 2014 sort of coming into this year. We were able to overcome that. So that\u2019s part of our confidence.","Ankur Vyas","","Christine, we have time for one more question.","Operator","","Thank you. The last question comes from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. You may ask your question.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","","Thank you. Let's go back to that $200 million earnings hit from the swaps as you have already kind of given into the fact that you're adding some swaps here recently with growth. But as you've pushed your horizon for the rise in interest rates and the Fed funds rate not until 2016 and as we've seen in the long end of the curve, it's flattening, so we don't really feel like even when rates go up, you are going to see the long end go up too much. So re-rolling the swaps doesn't seem like a lot of risk if we're talking about such a benign interest rate rise over the next couple of years. So I know when you first talked about rolling them off, you thought rates were going up in \u201815. So is your attitude towards doing those things changing at this point?","Aleem Gillani","","I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d say Marty that our attitude overall is changing. Our ALCO meets regularly and sets for the company what we think are prudent interest rate risk targets and an overall duration for the balance sheet, and within that we try to manage our rate risk within the guidelines set by ALCO to maximize both current income as well as market value of equity of the whole company. So we are looking at this regularly, we are looking at it monthly.","We\u2019re taking advantage of either big changes in client behavior or changes in market behavior wherever we can and I think you\u2019ve seen us over time demonstrate a little bit of an aptitude toward being able to do this well and as we continue to see opportunities and as our client business continues to grow, we\u2019ll be taking advantage of both of those to manage our rate risk in total, one component of which is this book.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","","Just one follow-up to that. How much in short-term rate rise do you need in your sense to breakeven to letting the swaps roll off? So is it 50 basis points, 100 basis points, 200 basis points? How much do you need to refill that hole?","Aleem Gillani","","Our overall asset sensitivity, as a company, is 3.9%. So, if we get 100 basis point parallel shift in rates, you\u2019d see our net interest income climb by approximately 4% and that\u2019s going to be about the kind of number that you see as a headwind for us next year.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","","Got you. So the 100 basis points is what you're looking for to make up for what you're losing here?","Aleem Gillani","","At this time.","Ankur Vyas","","All right. Thank you everyone. This concludes our call. Thanks for joining us today, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the Investor Relations department.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes today's conference.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead, sir.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SunTrust Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Ankur. Good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the third quarter, which we highlight on slide 3. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.56, which represents a 47% year-over-year increase. Our strong credit quality, improved efficiency and solid loan growth were key drivers of the year-over-year improvement with continued benefit from a favorable operating environment, given both lower tax rates, including certain discrete benefits in the third quarter and higher interest rates.","The culture of continuous improvement we've instilled across the company is reflected within the results. Our increased discipline on both expenses and returns continues to drive improvements in our profitability. I'll highlight some overall revenue trends. On the lending side, we had good growth in the third quarter with average loan balances up 1.8 billion or 1%, driven by growth across most categories. This is a reflection of the momentum we have with both wholesale and consumer clients, in addition to new lending capabilities we've added over the past few quarters.","These levels of loan growth have outpaced our deposit growth, which in turn has driven increased usage of wholesale funding. While this is a positive for net interest income, our net interest margin declined 1 basis point this quarter, as we previewed a month ago. On the fee side, capital markets related income declined sequentially, largely due to the timing of certain deals, which were pushed in to the fourth quarter. That said, our performance in equity and M&A were strong as well as our progress on delivering capital market solutions to non-CIB clients, all of which continue to reflect our increased strategic relevance to clients.","Our quarter ended strong and investment banking pipelines look very healthy, but I'm much more focused on our long term growth versus any one quarter. So overall, our revenue trends were somewhat mixed in the third quarter, I feel positive about the momentum we have going into the next quarter. More importantly, I feel even better about how we continue to work together as one team to deliver our full capabilities to our clients.","This is simply how we win at SunTrust. Separately, credit quality continues to be a strength for us, not only because of the favorable operating environment, but also because of our disciplined risk culture. Our consistently lower charge-off ratio and improved outlook for credit losses across the portfolio drove a 4 basis point decline in our ALLL ratio.","Our efficiency ratio remained stable, compared to the second quarter, despite the decline in fee income, due in part to our ongoing focus on disciplined expense management and also due to certain benefits realized in the third quarter. Again, our long term performance is much more important than our quarterly results and we remain highly focused on creating capacity to support our onboard investments and revenue growth and technology to better serve our clients, while also improving our efficiency.","We have delivered consistently on these strategic imperatives. Lastly, we commenced our 2018 capital plan in the third quarter, executing 25% of our authorized $2 billion share repurchase program, helping reduce our share count by 4% compared to the prior year. Overall, our earnings performance year to date has been strong and bigger picture, I'm confident that 2018 will be the seventh consecutive year of higher earnings per share, improved efficiency and increased capital returns.","This consistent track record continues to validate our improved execution, the strength and diversity of our franchise and our increased relevance with clients, which is in large part due to our ongoing investments in talent and technology.","Now, let me turn it over to Allison to cover some more details.","Allison Dukes","Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Moving to slide 4, our net interest margin declined by one basis point this quarter, consistent with the updated guidance we provided recently. Our loan growth has outpaced deposit growth, which has driven a need for higher levels of wholesale funding. We also saw continued mix shift within our deposit towards higher cost deposits, including our targeted focus on CDs and certain corporate deposits.","More importantly, these increased funding costs were driven by the strong loan growth we delivered, resulting in a solid $24 million sequential increase in net interest income. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our net interest margin to increase by 0 to 2 basis points relative to the third quarter, largely as a result of the September rate hike.","Moving to slide 5, non-interest income decreased by 47 million sequentially, driven primarily by lower capital markets revenues, which as Bill mentioned were impacted by the timing of certain transactions that were pushed into the fourth quarter. There were also a few discrete items, which negatively impacted fee income trends. Specifically, the second quarter included $12 million of gains related to a fintech equity investment and the third quarter included a $7 million charge in card fees, related to a change in our processing for recognizing rewards expenses, which was effectively a result of four months of reward expenses being recorded in the third quarter.","Looking into the fourth quarter, non-interest income should build off the third quarter level. Capital markets pipelines are strong in certain fee income categories, including mortgage servicing and CRE related income are seasonally higher in the fourth quarter.","As you can see on slide 6, the solid expense discipline we've been delivering continued into the third quarter. Expenses were stable sequentially and year-over-year, as increases in outside processing and software for both periods were offset by declines across most expense categories, given our ongoing efficiency initiatives, revenue trends and certain benefits earned in the current quarter.","On the latter point, one of the larger benefits within net occupancy expense where we had a large tenant from one of our owned office buildings terminate their lease early, which drove some benefits in the second quarter and a larger benefit in the third quarter. Outside processing and software expense increased sequentially and year-over-year. The primary driver is increased software amortization expense for new and upgraded technology assets.","The most notable investments include a new default management platform, which automates key aspects of our workout program and replaces legacy systems and our data lake, which is foundational to our ability to leverage data to improve the client experience and enhance revenue streams. We also had $67 million or $0.14 per share of discrete tax benefit this quarter, related to the finalization of tax reform and the merger of SunTrust Mortgage into SunTrust Bank, the latter of which I will cover on the consumer slide.","On a separate note, I want to make you aware of the charge we will recognize in the fourth quarter. In connection with our continued effort to de-risk the balance sheet, we are terminating a pension plan that we acquired as a part of the National Commerce Financial acquisition in 2004. The terminations will result in an approximately $60 million to $65 million one-time pretax charge related to unrealized losses, previously recorded in AOCI.","This is in accordance with accounting requirements, for which differences between expected and actual performance are recorded in AOCI and then subsequently recognized in a P&L over time or upon termination or settlement of the pension plan. As you can see on slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio was 58.9% for the quarter and 59.9% year-to-date. Given the progress we've made, we're on track to achieve our sub 60% target.","Equally important, we remain focused on continuing to create capacity to invest in technology and talent, given the compelling opportunities we have to invest in growth, which we believe will create the most long term value for our clients and for our shareholders. Our performance in 2018 validates our ability to do this. Specifically, outside processing and software costs, which is where a portion of our technology spend resides are up 9% and yet our efficiency ratio still has improved by 150 basis points.","Our proven, consistent track record should give you the confidence that we will continue to deliver efficiency improvement, but the exact pace of our improvement will be dependent upon the investment opportunities we pursue and the economic environment in any given quarter or any given year.","Moving now to slide 8. Our net charge off ratio increased from 20 basis points to 24 basis points sequentially. The low level of net charge-offs reflects the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I, CRE and residential portfolios, performance we are strongly pleased with that we remain cognizant that there could be some variability going forward. The ALLL ratio declined by 4 basis points sequentially, as a result of the continued asset quality improvement.","Provision expense increased by $29 million from a very low level in the second quarter, as a result of a lower ALLL decline and slightly higher net charge-offs. Given the trends we're seeing in our portfolio, we would expect to operate within a 25 to 30 basis point range of net charge-offs, as we look into the fourth quarter. We do expect ALLL ratio to generally stabilize from here, which would result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-off, given loan growth.","Now moving to the balance sheet on slide 9. Improved lending trends we saw in the second quarter continued this quarter with average loans up 1% and period end loans up 2% sequentially. The growth was broad based across C&I, CRE, consumer lending and mortgage. Looking ahead, we have strong momentum across both commercial and consumer lending and our pipelines support this.","On the deposit side, average balances were stable sequentially and year-over-year. As anticipated, we continue to see a migration from lower cost deposits to CDs, largely due to our targeted strategy, which allows us to retain our existing depositors and capture new market share, also managing our asset sensitivity profile. We still believe this is an effective strategy and would expect the migration from lower cost deposits in to CDs to continue as interest rates rise.","Separately, within our wholesale business, we increase rates on our corporate liquidity product, given this is a more attractive source of funding than wholesale debt and we saw solid growth in response. Interest bearing deposit costs increased 11 basis points sequentially, slightly higher than the prior quarter increase of 10 basis points, given the continued increases in benchmark rates, the migration towards higher cost deposits and the pickup in lending activity.","We expect deposit betas to continue to trend upwards, but the trajectory will be influenced by the absolute level of rates, in addition to the levels of loan growth we are delivering. We remain focused on maximizing the value proposition for our clients, outside of rate paid and thus improving our deposit growth trajectory in a responsible fashion. However, if deposit growth is lower, our access alternative funding is strong.","Moving to slide 10, which provides an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel 3 common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.6% and the tier 1 ratio was 10.7%, both were down slightly relative to the prior quarter, due to growth in risk weighted assets and the commencement of our 2018 capital plan, which provides for a 52% increase in share repurchases and a 25% increase in the dividend.","We're beginning to make progress towards our medium term capital ratio objectives. Our capital plan commission does give us the flexibility to accelerate our share repurchase cadence, which is the strategy we are considering for the fourth quarter, given our views on current valuation, relative to our future potential.","Now moving to the segment overview, I'll begin with the consumer segment on slide 11, where we continue to have solid momentum. Our positive lending trends continued in the third quarter, in large part due to the investments we've made in LightStream, our point of sale lending partnership and credit card, all of which collectively improve our growth, returns and diversity.","Our momentum in LightStream continues, given the work we've done this year to enhance our analytic, new product offerings and growth and partnerships and referrals. Some of this collective growth has been offset by the continued declines in home equity and slower growth from certain lower return portfolios, like auto. While we're seeing strong growth in net interest income within consumer, mortgage related income has been pressured, particularly when looking at year-over-year trends.","Relatedly, we completed the merger of SunTrust Mortgage in to SunTrust Bank in the third quarter. This merger will simplify our organizational structure and allows for efficiencies, but more importantly, it will allow us to more fully serve the needs of our consumer clients, irrespective of whether they begin their SunTrust relationship with a mortgage or another lending or deposit product.","In the third quarter, we recognized roughly $21 million of the tax benefits from this merger. There are also approximately $13 million of related conversion costs, most of which will be reported in the fourth quarter. Partially offsetting the mortgage declines is Wealth Management, which is demonstrating positive underlying trends. AUM is up 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, a reflection that our value proposition of our targeted client segments is resonating in the marketplace, driving growth in new clients and greater wallet share with existing clients.","Wealth management related non-interest income is up a solid 4% year-over-year. In addition to the solid revenue growth in consumer, the actions we have taken to improve efficiency are driving improvements and overall profitability. When excluding a $55 million legal accrual reversal in the third quarter of 2017, our tangible efficiency ratio has improved by 230 basis points year to date in the consumer segment.","Relatedly, our branch count is down by 5% in the past year, which is largely enabled by our increasing digital adoption rate and as a part of our broader strategy to leverage technology, to enhance our efficiency. Our increased digital adoption rates are also reflected in the national recognition we are receiving for these digital capabilities. Javelin recently awarded SunTrust for leader awards for online and mobile banking capability.","SunTrust was one of only four banks to receive a Leader award in four or more distinct category. Separately, our mortgage servicing business was named top five by JD Power and our auto finance business was named top three overall by auto finance performance. The latter two awards are a testament to the outstanding service our teammates are providing our clients.","Bigger picture, we're just over a year into our journey of creating a more integrated consumer business and we're very pleased with the initial results. We've made good strides in appropriately wiring the ecosystem, so we're anticipating and delivering the right solution and advice at the right time. This not only enhances the client experience, it also generates operational efficiencies. We still have more work to do, but we have a great team in place, we have a clear strategy and we are in some of the highest growth markets in the country.","Moving to wholesale banking, on slide 12, where our consistent strategy continues to drive good results. On the lending side, we saw solid growth across CIB, commercial and CRE. More broadly, the growth in our wholesale lending portfolio is a reflection of our clients increased optimism on the economy, which has resulted in higher utilization rates and increased M&A activity.","This growth also reflects the investments we have made to meet a broader set of client needs, especially within CRE and aging services, in addition to our geographic expansion of commercial banking. Within capital markets, we had another good quarter, but revenue was down compared to the prior quarter and prior year, both of which were especially strong quarters. The primary driver of the decline was the timing of certain transactions, which were pushed into the fourth quarter.","More broadly, we are also seeing continued pressures on capital markets fees and structures, given the impact non-bank lenders are having on the space. Maintaining underwriting discipline is a key tenant of our strategy and we will therefore continue to pass on transactions, where the structures do not comply with our standards. That said, the underlying strategic momentum within capital markets is strong.","Specifically, M&A and equity related income is up 7% year-to-date, which is helping to offset some of the aforementioned declines in debt capital markets. Both M&A and equity have been key areas of strategic investment for us and we are encouraged by the continued momentum we are having in meeting more of the strategic needs of our clients. And year-to-date, capital markets fees from commercial banking, CRE and CWM clients are up 37%.","We're still in the early stages of executing the strategy, but we are highly encouraged by the momentum and we believe we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this space, given our full set of capabilities and one team approach. The partnership between our commercial bankers, investment bankers, product and industry specialists and corporate finance teams is a great reflection of our culture.","And finally, we're benefiting from continued low charge-off levels, which are a reflection of the overall strength of the economy in addition to our consistent discipline around credit, structure and diversity. Big picture, more market conditions can and do create quarterly variability, pipelines are healthy and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we have in wholesale, as we bring our differentiated business model to new and existing clients.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Allison. To conclude, I'll point to slide 13, which highlights how our performance this quarter aligns with our investment thesis. Overall, this was a good quarter, in one where our performance is the direct result of strategies we've put in place and investments that we've made. There were some puts and takes on the revenue side, largely tied to market conditions, but the diversity of our business mix and loan portfolio enable us to maintain relatively stable revenue trends.","Importantly, my near to medium term optimism about our client business remains high. I've spent a lot of time with our teams in annual wholesale client planning process recently, and I've never been more encouraged with our go to market strategy, one team approach and most importantly, our talent. While the competitive environment is intense and in some cases irrational, when we lead with purpose, advice, expertise and our one team approach, we have an opportunity to win without simply using price or structure.","Across the entire company, we remain highly focused on making the right investments today, which position us to meet more client needs and drive incremental growth in the future. Allison highlighted a number of digital awards our consumer team received this quarter, which reflect years of investment and focus on improving our digital client facing capabilities. Between our mobile and online capabilities for consumer clients, [indiscernible] digital mortgage application, I feel very good about our collective set of digital capabilities for consumers and the progress we've made in enhancing these platforms over the last few years and we'll continue to make the requisite amount of technology investments to meet evolving client needs and to strengthen our underlying foundation and technology infrastructure.","That said, improvements in efficiency and investments in technology can coexist, as they've already done in 2018 and in previous years. Pace, cadence and execution are also important, simply investing more will not guarantee success. There's a possibility we'll achieve our sub-60 adjusted tangible efficiency ratio objective in 2018. It will be close. And if we don't, we'll achieve it in 2019 and we'll continue to have efficiency opportunities beyond that.","The pace of improvement will vary year to year, as we take advantage of opportunities to grow our client base, improve the client experience and harvest efficiency savings. In addition to efficiency progress, we're beginning to make steps toward achieving our steady state capital objectives. We began our 2018 capital plan in the third quarter and still have 1.5 billion shares - dollars of shares to purchase over the coming three quarters.","Our capital ratios declined by 15 basis points this quarter, putting us on a path towards achieving our 8% to 9% CET1 target. This trajectory when combined with positive mix shift in our lending portfolio and future efficiency improvement will continue to enhance the overall ROE profile of the company. This performance is positive and it cannot be achieved without our purpose of lighting the way of the financial wellbeing.","Our company has again been tested with two devastating hurricanes, impacting our footprint in the past month and it never ceases to amaze me how much our teammates will do for our clients and for other teammates in the most challenging of circumstances. It is in these times that we're acutely aware of our obligation and commitment to enable financial confidence for our clients. We had few mobile ATMs, which we deployed in our disaster recovery truck in some of the most heavily impacted areas within the Panhandle two days after Hurricane Michael made landfall and we were one of the first banks to reopen in Wilmington after Hurricane Florence came through.","Our teammates put their own needs aside and I'm incredibly grateful for their commitment to serving our clients. They do this because they believe in our work, they believe in our company and most importantly, they believe in our purpose. So team, thank you.","In summary, we had a good quarter and our performance year-to-date has been very strong. As I said in the beginning, we have good momentum building in to the final quarter of the year and setting the stage for 2019. Thus, I remain highly optimistic in our ability to continue to deliver value for our clients, communities, teammates and our owners.","So with that, Ankur, I'll turn it back over to you for Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. We're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein.","John McDonald","Bill, you showed good loan growth this quarter. It looks like 5% or so linked quarter annualized and came in a little bit better than maybe Allison had signaled at the Brokers conference and didn't slow from the second quarter. Kind of wondering if you could discuss what you're seeing in terms of current drivers and how you feel about pipelines and loan growth momentum heading into the fourth quarter.","Bill Rogers","I think we're benefiting from a number of things. One is the markets we serve and the businesses in which we specialize. Most importantly, the loan growth was really broad based. And C&I was, what I like, it was more advice driven, more proactive versus reactive. I think it reflected some of the investments we've made in talent, training, technology. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, are really rigorous intensity around client planning and accountability.","On the consumer side, I think we were capitalizing on investments we've made to meet evolving consumer preferences and we're just quite frankly delivering a really, really great experience. Also investments we've made with new partnerships and then on the mortgage side, we had some good seasonality increase there. So it was broad based.","To your next question, I think the pipelines are really, really strong across all of those categories. So, I think the momentum is good, heading into the fourth quarter and headed into next year.","John McDonald","And just as a follow-up, one of the key drivers this quarter seem to be commercial real estate, where other banks are being cautious and some even smaller banks are starting to show a little bit of signs of stress. Recognizing that you're somewhat under indexed in CRE, can you just talk a little bit about how you're feeling of that segment and where you're seeing growth opportunities and that making sure that those are good loans you're making at this point in the cycle?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I mean, you mentioned, we're a little under-indexed to CRE, but most of that growth has been related to strategies we've put in place now, a little over a year ago, related to two primary components. One is with our acquisition of Pillar, we have more opportunity to bridge some agency lending. So we have a really good partnership there to be able to provide lending in anticipation of fully underwritten agency deals. And then the second is we made a decision to do some longer term, medium to longer term financing on deals that we liked and rather than just doing the construction loan, it's doing a little more medium term financing. So it's not that we're sort of leaning against the wind, it's that we've got strategies in place that are just resulting in positive momentum.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","I was hoping to follow up on the NIM guidance. Obviously, NIM came in a little bit worse than you had expected this quarter and you did signal that a month ago. So I guess just trying to get your confidence in the fourth quarter and then guide in terms of being a little conservative and hopefully not getting caught off guard at all there.","Allison Dukes","Sure. Thanks, Matt. So, yes, I mean, relative to the revised guidance we provided in September, NIM did end up down 1 basis point for the quarter and really that was, as I noted, just a function of two things. One, we didn't get the run up and one month LIBOR over the course of the third quarter that we might have expected and two, have more positively - it was really driven by the strong loan growth we saw in the second quarter, which did create an increased reliance on some higher cost funding, that higher beta corporate deposits as well as some wholesale funding.","As we think about fourth quarter and our guidance of 0 to 2 for this quarter, we really simply expect the full benefit of the September rate hike to actually materialize in the fourth quarter and so our guidance of 0 to 2 incorporates that. And, there's some expectation there as well, but betas do continue to increase modestly over the course of the quarter as well.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then just separately following up on the comment about considering accelerating the share buybacks, maybe you can give more color on that in terms of what the magnitude might be and when you can get back to the market and buy back stock.","Allison Dukes","Sure. So, as we noted, our share buybacks for the year, we were approved for a $2 billion total share buyback. We executed on 500 million of that in the third quarter. What I will tell you in the fourth quarter is that 500 million will definitely be the floor for what we execute in this quarter. We feel really good about the prospects there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Wanted to dig in a little bit on the C&I loan growth, which was quite good, especially relative to competitors and understand how you're able to execute that in a market where the bid for bank loan is very high. Obviously, there's some competition from the CLO side, so maybe you could give us a sense as to how you either interplay with that asset class or are you underwriting things that's just not that attractive to them? And maybe you can also help understand on the IP side, why there was a little bit weaker loan syndication again, what we're hearing in the backdrop is that there's a huge bid for C&I loans. So wanted to get your thoughts and color on that?","Bill Rogers","Sure. Let me start with the non-bank side, which clearly we've seen some competition, but in fairness, most of that is sitting on the leverage lending side from a loan growth standpoint, but much smaller part of our portfolio. So, that impact on loan growth is lessened as it relates to specific non-bank competition. We see it on the CRE side as well, but there again, we've got strategies in place that I think reflect the quality of our relationships and investments we've made that sort of run counter to some of the non-bank competition.","And then as it relates to the other balance of C&I growth, it's really just based on the investments we've made and specialization that we have, this really strong working relationship we have with our commercial team and our investment banking team such that we're really providing great advice. I think I mentioned in my comments that earlier, I mean, when I look at the loan activity, it just seems much more higher quality, it's much more proactive versus reactive, it's much more advice driven. And as I said fairly broad based and we also talked about the consumer side and the investments we've made there and the client experience that we're providing and the relevance of being where our clients want to make decisions, I think are things that are - continue to be strong as it relates to C&I.","Then, you asked a little bit about the investment banking side. And yeah, the syndication side was a little lower this quarter. I think a lot of change in to the fourth quarter or [just looking] [ph] to the fourth quarter, a lot of that has been that category. So overall, for the year, I think we'll still have a strong year in syndicated finance, again same thing. We're at the front end of more of those deals, we're on the left side of more of those deals, so the quality of that fee generation to me is sort of exponentially higher than it was several years ago.","Allison Dukes","And Bill got it, but I would say nothing has changed in our underwriting standards on the C&I side. We remain very disciplined there. What you see really is just evidence of the strategy both from an industry focus, but also as we continue to execute against our strategy in commercial and really delivering it by some expertise down market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Amanda Larsen","This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. Allison, you mentioned that fees should bounce in 4Q in a few categories. Should we expect to see an offsetting increase in quarter-over-quarter expense to support that revenue [balance] [ph]?","Allison Dukes","Yes. I mean I think if you're saying, what should we expect for expenses in the fourth quarter, given fees were lighter in the third quarter, yes, as fees increase, in the fourth quarter, you would expect some element of expense growth to go hand in hand with that.","Amanda Larsen","And then thinking about headcount and branch reductions from here, those figures are both down 6% year over year and 5% year over year respectively. Do you expect the pace of these declines to abate from here given already great progress in achieving the efficiencies?","Allison Dukes","Sure. As it relates to branch reduction, we've actually shrunk our branch count by about 25% already. As I think about where we could go from here, I'd say, we expect to continue to shrink our branch network somewhere in the range of 4% or so a year. That's really influenced by consumer behavior patterns and that will influence in any given year, how quickly we go and optimizing the density of our network and you would expect at least as it relates to branches some headcount changes there, but we don't focus a whole lot on headcount. We think more about our efficiency and how we continue to deliver continuous improvement on the efficiency ratio from their headcount nearly and input.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","On the deposit side, there was a pretty significant drop off in period end non-interest bearing deposits. Can you maybe give us a bit of background on what was happening there?","Allison Dukes","Sure. I would caution you in looking at period end balances with deposits, I think average balances are going to be better indication of our deposit activity. I mean, specifically, what was going on in period end non-interest bearing deposits, as at the end of the second quarter, we had a short but large escrow deposit come in a few days before the end of the quarter that went out just a few days at the beginning - after the beginning of the quarter and that was expected. And so if you look at average balance at quarter to quarter, sequential quarter declines were 90 basis points of non-interest bearing deposits, which is really going to be I think a better indication of our performance. If you think about operating accounts, especially now and DDA, there is always going to be month end period end noise.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then you've spoken a bit today and also at the conference in September about expecting to see some money move out of those non-interest bearing balances over time, because of higher rates and the increased opportunity cost to leaving cash earnings zero. Can you help frame that for us, if they're a portion of that deposit base that you kind of feel is sticky and will stay there regardless of the rate environment and a portion that you think is potentially going to move around, as rates keep on moving up.","Allison Dukes","Sure, it's hard to size exactly, but generally speaking, yes, as rates continue to move up, you would expect that non-interest bearing deposit levels do decline modestly over time. I mean, as we know, they're up quite a bit, given the protracted low rate environment, so you would expect some sort of normalized decline as those balances do look for better rate. I would say, one of our strategies is really to focus on our rates with our corporate liquidity product, which is a very attractive source of funding for us. We can actively manage that to help our clients meet their objectives and it's a better cost of funding for us relative to wholesale funding.","Geoffrey Elliott","And just quickly there, you're talking about earnings credit rating or you're talking about the interest rate on that corporate liquidity offering?","Allison Dukes","I am sorry, say again, I couldn't hear you.","Geoffrey Elliott","Are you talking about an earnings credit right there or are you talking about an interest rate, depending on accounts there?","Allison Dukes","I'm talking about interest rate and not product.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Bill, this question might fall in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, before you came, SunTrust had 25 years of negative operating leverage, since 2011, it's been positive, the efficiency ratio has gone from 72% to 60%, but what's left with the efficiency and why aren't your targets more ambitious? Now, I just know - mostly at your targets, as you said, you have a better franchise, peers are moving up and best in class is in the low-50s. So a concern is, are you relaxing your intensity a little bit in terms of the tone at the top of the firm because the rate of improvement is not as much and so how are you thinking about that.","Bill Rogers","Well, Mike, looking across the table at my leadership, team when you said relaxing and the intensity and there is a hell a lot of smiles on their faces, because they're not feeling any relaxation on the intensity. So, in the - no good deed goes unpunished. Appreciate the introduction. We've got the exact same focus on continuous improvement creating positive operating leverage and creating an improvement in the tangible efficiency ratio. That slope is going to just change by definition. The actual rate of - the actual efficiency ratio for any one back is also dependent upon a couple of things.","One is their business mix and secondly, the intensity and the opportunity. We're trying to balance all that. I can assure you that '18 is going to be better than '17, and '19 is going to be better than '18. I mean, we're going to continue to be on that kind of pace. We are making sure though Mike, that we're also creating the right level of investment for the future of the company.","I think this year is a pretty good example where you can see it probably more or verbally than you have in the past where you saw 150 basis point of efficiency improvement and then you saw outside processing and software costs go up 9%, just to sort of pick a line, which demonstrates the fact that you can invest and become more efficient at the same time, which is the commitment that we have. So, so some of it's going to be creating capacity. But all is going to be focused on making sure we're creating the long term best shareholder value we can at SunTrust","Mike Mayo","As far as a new efficiency target, if we were going to get one, would that be say in January and also you mentioned reduction in branches, 4% per year, any other kind of general areas where you might be able to reap additional efficiencies?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I mean just to go with the latter part first. I mean, opportunities to achieve efficiency are everywhere. It's optimizing, staffing, that's right sizing, that's realizing and harvesting. We have a lot of investments that are on a variety of different J curves, from new markets to new private wealth teams to technology to CRM to all the things we've talked about, all of those things have harvest components to them. So we've made the investment and they have components in the past.","In our private wealth side, we've made a lot of investments on the robotics side, the AI side. We'll get $20 million worth of improvement and that kind of investment and that kind of J curve, while improving client service, new origination platforms and mortgage and wholesale, I mean, there are lots of things. That's really not, as a matter of fact, I would probably discourage you from looking at the branch count as being sort of the only thing or the [indiscernible]. I mean, it's a lot of different things.","As it relates to specific targets, the target for right now is that we're going to be back and we're going to balance that against the investments that we've got, the opportunities we have and at every point, Mike, we will continue to talk about it and hopefully continue to provide more clarity, but more importantly, provide more evidence of the fact that we're on this pace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Mr. Cassidy, your line is open.","Bill Rogers","Tony, maybe, we can move to the next question.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","My first question is on the strategy for the unfunding side. As loan growth could potentially continue to outpace deposit growth, I'm wondering what your decision tree is in terms of filling in with wholesale funding versus having a more aggressive campaign on the deposit side.","Allison Dukes","Sure. Thanks, Erika. So, yes, I mean loan growth could continue to outpace deposit growth, although, I would tell you we remain extremely focused on generating strong deposit growth. And notably, as you look at our CD growth, which has really been our targeted strategy for growth on the deposit side, about 40% of that growth this year is new money. So $2 billion of new money balances this year. So, we start there and really thinking about how do we continue to refine our deposit growth strategy, how do we use CDs to, which we like, because it actually gives us the opportunity to manage our asset sensitivity, but to deepen our growth with our existing client base and to attract new household deposits.","After that, we look at our corporate funding and I mentioned our corporate liquidity products, which give us an opportunity to meet our wholesale clients, and actively use rate quarter-to-quarter, depending on the level of loan growth to help us create attractive sources of funding. And then we look to wholesale funding, we have access to a variety of sources of funding there, both secured and unsecured from the Federal Home Loan Bank to the market and we like our sources of funding on that side as well. So we feel like we have broad access and a number of diversified sources of funding, but we're going to start with really meeting our clients' needs, through both our consumer and wholesale funding strategies.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. And as a follow up to that, if banks that are SunTrust size, get relief on the LCR, what kind of flexibility do you have on the balance sheet to be able to self-fund future loan growth?","Allison Dukes","Incrementally. Yeah, it'd be hard to size that incrementally. I wouldn't say it's a tremendous difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy. Please go ahead with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, you just talked about the expectation that you're going to see the non-interest bearing deposit accounts draw down as rates go higher as well everybody in the industry. When you go back to the last tightening cycle from 94, I'm sorry '04 to '06, which is about 400 basis points, SunTrust non-interest bearing deposits, the total deposits declined about from 26% to 18%. Do you see a structural difference today where that decline may not be as material this time around for you if rates go up another couple of hundred basis points over the next 18 months.","Allison Dukes","I think that is a question certainly for us and a broader question for the industry that we're all evaluating. I mean, the one structural difference I would certainly point to is the fact that our relationships are much broader now with our clients than just rate. We offer our deposit clients so much more than rate paid. We offered them on line and mobile banking, a number of ways to interact with us through multiple channels, the benefit of the advice and solutions that they get, both through our online channels, but also in person. And so I do think structurally that we'll have some differences on how non-interest bearing deposits play out over this rate cycle, relative to others.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. The one thing I would add to that is just the commitment we made to be a more diversified franchise that holds true on the asset side, but also on the liability side. So, we're much more diversified by client type, by geography and then as Allison said, much more deeply penetrated. So I think this cycle, I don't know that the last cycle will be an exact predictor for this one.","Gerard Cassidy","And then just changing tacks here, on technology, you guys obviously have done a very good job in implementing your digital strategy and driving down your efficiency ratio or helping drive down the efficiency ratio. Can you share with us, what kind of penetration you're seeing in your consumer base for the number of customers that are using the digital channel, how many customers are using your mobile offerings and then finally just the total technology spend, what you guys are thinking about in that area?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. We've had strong mobile adoption. We're hovering right around 50% and most importantly, it really picked up every quarter. So, every quarter, we continue to see an improvement in mobile adoption, which applies to voting with their usage of our products and capabilities in addition to how they rate what we do, both from our clients and both from some of the external rating categories.","So I think we're pleased with the level of mobile adoption. If you go down any category from sign-ons to mobile deposits, the online sign-ons, all of those are increasing at an increasing rate, which we view as positive. We're careful about sort of saying the number as it relates to total technology spend as everybody thinks about that differently and they look at capitalization rates and amortization rates and all those things differently.","Just to say though that our overall investment in technology continues to grow and we sort of demonstrate some evidence of that. And all that is part of the efficiency initiative as to create capacity to continue to make relevant investments in technology that we think have long term benefits.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss with B. Riley FBR.","Steve Moss","Just want to ask about the credit cycle here, wondering if you are seeing any lending practices that cause concern or cause you to think that we are late in the credit cycle here.","Allison Dukes","Sure. This is Allison. I'd say lending practices that cause concern. First, as we mentioned non-bank competition, we do see very aggressive lending there as it relates to both structure term and pricing. I don't know that it causes us concern in our own portfolio, and let me say, more definitively, it doesn't cause us concern in our own portfolio because we deliberately pass on those and we haven't changed our own underwriting standards.","As we look at our own portfolios and scour them, which we're doing constantly and you would expect us to do to look for any flashing yellow light of any concern, again, this quarter kind of consistent with the last few quarters, we really just don't see anything of particular concern. We watch it very closely. We're stressing at underwriting all of our portfolios for an increasing rate environment, but we do that on both the consumer side and the corporate side. As we think about the pressure of a rising rate environment and any stress that could have put on our clients, so we underwrite it at that level. We've kept a close eye on retail. That has not been an area of concern, although there was some noise there and we continue to keep a close eye on it as that is an area that is subject to disintermediation.","And then, I'd say on the leverage lending side, I mean, there's obviously been a lot written around those portfolios and that is a - it's been a consistent portion of our balance sheet overall. It's really well diversified across sectors and that's the own area we keep a close eye on, although, we haven't seen any signs of stress yet.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. The one thing I would add, I'm not sure if it's necessarily a reflection of end of cycle as much as it's a reflection of how much liquidity exists in the system. So, there is a lot of money that's available to, if you pick the category, the non-bank lenders. If we look at sort of our own pipelines and near and medium term opportunities, we still see a lot of opportunities. So, we still see a good amount of runway.","Again, I think, it's primarily a reflection of just how much money is available to chase that yield.","Steve Moss","And then just on loan repricing here, I hear you on LIBOR increase in a slower pace, but the increase in C&I loan yields was perhaps a lighthouse, thinking - wondering if you're seeing more of a move to fixed rate lending or if you're starting to hedge?","Allison Dukes","No. I don't - I wouldn't say we're seeing more of a move. It's a fixed rate landing and in terms of hedging our own book, we really use our swap book to manage our interest rate sensitive overall and I think I'd say our views there are pretty consistent with what really have been. But if you're asking sort of broadly, are we seeing any sort of shift in the market right now, my answer to that would be no.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks.","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask, going to this another efficiency initiative, I'm sure you're terminating that pension plan in that $60 million of, I get this right, it was already in your AOCI. So it didn't really affect your equity or your tangible book value, but I guess it will be recognized, I guess, would that be the fourth quarter and what are the expenses related to that each year. So you're going to pick up an efficiency again once that's done. So I just was trying to catch that a little bit.","Allison Dukes","Sure. Thanks, Marty. So, yes, you're right. The unrealized loss associated with our pension plan in AOCI today. So effectively, what the accounting requirement causes to do is flush that cost as a charge through the P&L in the fourth quarter. And as I said, that would be $60 million to $65 million in this quarter.","As it relates to ongoing efficiency improvement there, it is de minimus and it was a relatively small plan. So, I wouldn't point to anything that's going to flow through on an annual basis from here.","Marty Mosby","And then the issuance of long term debt, it looks like there was about $1.5 billion and it really didn't move the needle on the, I was trying to look at the period and average and it looked like average went up, so it was reflected in the average, but the yield still remained around 2.92%. So is that prefunding some of the loan growth you expect to see, because when you put longer term funding on, that helps the LCR? So that gives you the ability or capacity to put loans against it. So I just didn't know if that was part of what was in the margin this quarter as well as prefunding some of the loan growth next year.","Allison Dukes","No. It really wasn't [indiscernible] loan to deposit ratio and the movement there quarter over quarter, I mean that was just really, as a part of our normalized funding plan for the quarter and wasn't necessarily - certainly wasn't any prefunding, it was just there to provide funding necessary inside of the quarter.","Marty Mosby","And would there be any incremental drag from that because it was issued in this particular quarter. So at least, there was part of the impact on the margin came from putting that extra amount of funding in at that higher rate?","Allison Dukes","Not really. I mean, there wasn't enough time for it to actually have that much of an impact on the quarter and as you think about our guidance for this quarter of 0 to 2, the wholesale funding that was done previously and that we would anticipate going forward is in that 0 to 2 guidance.","Operator","And our final question will come from Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","I guess I have a sort of a broader question. The investment narrative for SunTrust is that you're a leading player in a lot of growth markets, that your forward thinking of technology, of management team that's executed very effectively, but loan and revenue growth haven't necessarily been outsized more recently. And look, I get market conditions influence that, there are idiosyncrasies in any given quarter and you probably should grow frankly in some market environments. But if I take a step back and look beyond sort of a quarter to quarter, even the year trajectory, where should we see some of these positive elements or are some of the dynamics start to show up in your growth numbers and to deliver outside growth, where should we see that? What loan categories, what fee categories, how do we think about how it actually drives better than peer group loan growth or revenue growth?","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Saul. As you know, we don't typically guide or manage the loan growth. That's an outcome of the investments and the strategies that we have underway. Some of the exceptions to that are things like LightStream where we're leaning in heavily and see opportunities for growth. I think if you look back, just pick a couple of categories, so if you look back at investment banking and you look back at sort of a 10 plus percent CAGR for now well over ten years, I mean I think that some of the reflective things of prowess and opportunities that exist within our markets, but more importantly within the investments we've made and the specialties that we have.","So, I think that will be one of the categories that we'll see - we'll also see categories in private wealth, which reflects the transfer and the opportunities and the wealth building that's taken place in our markets. I mentioned the consumer lending component. We're going to see some - we're going to cycle now with mortgage that we've got the refi side we now and we'll see a more normalized version of mortgage, which I think will reflect some markets that we live in, the affordability and capacity for new home construction and formation in our markets.","Commercial real estate, in terms of the investments that we've made in agency product, investments in opportunities in our portfolio, the number of national and regional firms that are consolidating in the regions we have and then sort of core basic commercial banking, which we see good growth in and I think that probably is a strong reflection of the markets that we operate in and the ability to generate advice based, fee based business from that. So I think there are a good number of things and many of those have momentum and I think reflect markets and investments that we've made.","Ankur Vyas","Okay. Thanks, Saul.

Good morning everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we have also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements.

I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I am going to turn it over to Aleem for additional details. I will conclude with some perspectives on how our performance aligns well with our investment thesis.","So, before I get into the details of the financial performance of the company, I want to give thanks to our teammates, for the tremendous effort they put forth to help clients, communities and fellow teammates who were impacted by the hurricanes. ","For those of you that know us well, you know we\u2019re a purpose driven organization, and the way our teammates responded in the wake of these catastrophic storms truly demonstrated our purpose and action. Teammates across the company went above and beyond the call of duty working overtime, deploy mobile ATMs, delivery needed supplies and donations, and even many rescue boats to ensure that we helped our clients maintain financial confidence during these challenging times. So, despite the stress circumstances, it was a proud moment for me as the leader of this great team. ","Now, let me get into some specifics of the quarter. This quarter earnings per share were $1.06, up 16% year-over-year, this performance is driven by consistent execution against our strategy and investment thesis. We delivered solid revenue growth, particularly in areas where we have a demonstrated competitive advantage, we improved our efficiency and lastly our strong capital position is allowing us to reduce our share count. ","We delivered this overall performance, even after accounting for hurricane related reserve bills. Across all fronts, whether its revenue growth, profitability or credit, we had a strong quarter. ","While on the surface, loan growth is lower there was a lot of positive movement that\u2019s happening underneath. With C&I much of the elevated paydowns are from clients we felt to access to capital markets, where returns quite frankly don\u2019t meet our hurdles. Therefore, we have improved the ROE profile of the company and freed up capital for other client business, or to return to our shareholders and that\u2019s a tradeoff we\u2019re comfortable making. ","And consumer we are still seeing good growth across all fronts, in fact this quarter was a record for life stream originations. This is furthering the positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, contributing to our NIM expansion and helping us grow net interest income which was up $28 million sequentially. ","Within non-interest income, capital market continues to perform at very high levels. Investment banking income is up a meaningful 29% year-to-date and it's clear that the value proposition we provide to our wholesale clients remains highly differentiated in the marketplace. ","Net net revenues are up 2% sequentially and 4% year-over-year, the latter of which was achieved despite a nearly 50% decline in mortgage production income, which is a real testament to the improved diversity of the franchise. ","I am also pleased with the efficiency progress we continue to make. As you\u2019ll remember I indicated earlier this year that our efficiency performance needed to improve. We have made good progress since then and we are creating even more momentum across the company to achieve further efficiencies. This includes the actions we took this quarter to accelerate our progress, both to ensure that we are able to deliver on our commitments to our owners and create capacity for future investment and growth. ","Asset quality and consistent underwriting and return discipline continue to be key areas of strength for the company. This perspective is also shared by S&P who upgraded our credit ratings outlook to positive in September. We did have an elevated provision expense this quarter to provide for anticipated losses from the hurricanes. But these losses are very manageable in the context of the overall company particularly given the strength and diversity of the loan portfolio. ","And finally, we commenced our 2017 capital plan this quarter which means each order not only gains incremental ownership from the company as a result of our 38% increase in share repurchases, but they also benefit from a 54% increase in cash dividends. ","So big picture, I\u2019m pleased with how the year is progressing. Our consistent strategic focus keeps us on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of EPS growth, efficiency improvements and higher capital returns to shareholders. Our ROE profile also continues to improve a reflection of improved efficiency, disciplined balance sheet management and strong credit quality. ","So, with that as a short overview, I\u2019ll turn it over to Aleem to provide some more specifics on the quarter.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, thank you Bill. Good morning everybody, thank you for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll begin on slide 4. Our net interest margin improved one basis point this quarter which helped to drive the $28 million increase in net interest income. As anticipated, deposits betas did increase but much of the sequential change was due to a one time reprising of certain suite deposits and brokerage accounts in late June. Therefore, while betas will likely continue to nudge upward overtime, the slope of increase will not match this quarter\u2019s level. ","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect the net interest margin to decline by one to three basis points. This is consistent with our view that NIM grind down in quarters without a rate hike given lagging deposit costs and sprint compression in the C&I book, which is partially offset by continued positive mix shift in the overall portfolio. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the rate environment and we expect some NIM expansion as the short-end of the curve continues to rise. ","Moving to slide 5, you will see that non-interest income increased by $19 million sequentially primarily driven by our continued success in meeting the capital markets needs of more clients across the entire wholesale platform. This quarter specifically, capital markets related income increased to $24 million sequentially largely due to M&A and equity which both had record quarters, a great sign of SunTrust\u2019s increasing strategic relevance with our clients. ","Across the capital markets platform, we\u2019re encouraged not only by our current success, but also by the significant growth opportunities that remain as we leverage our competitive advantage to expand and deepen relationships with our investment banking, commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth clients. ","Mortgage related income was also up by $7 million sequentially as a result of improved gain on sale margins. These gains were partially offset by lower commercial real estate related income given slower levels of activity. But we do expect that to rebound in the fourth quarter. Let\u2019s move on to expenses on slide 6.","Expenses were stable relative to the prior quarter and as Bill mentioned, we did have some discrete items. First, several legacy legal matters were resolved in the third quarter, which totaled up to $58 million of legal accrual reversals. These benefits were largely absorbed by several discrete charges, including an elevated severance accrual. ","In addition, we also wrote down certain software related assets, as we accelerate technology enabled efficiency initiatives, particularly our transition to the cloud. Our strong overall business performance also resulted in increased incentive compensation expense this quarter. ","Compared to the prior year, expenses declined by $18 million, due to improved expense discipline and ongoing efficiency initiatives. In particular outside processing and software declined by $22 million, partially as a result of increased focus on third-party costs. ","As you will see on slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 59.2%. This includes the net result of discrete benefits and charges recognized in the quarter and I am pleased to note that our core efficiency as a company continues to improve. Clearly the efficiency initiatives we have been executing against for many years, are driving positive operating leverage and there is still more progress to be made. ","Across the company we are demonstrating heightened focused and vigor around reducing less productive expenses to provide funding for investments in talent, technology and improved product offerings, while also achieving our goal of a sub 60% tangible efficiency ratio by 2019. ","Moving to slide eight. Our asset quality metrics remain strong, evidenced by only 21 basis points of net charge-offs and 48 basis points of non-performing loans. These low levels reflect the relative strength we are seeing across our entire portfolio. ","The ALLL ratio increased by 3 basis points this quarter, as a result of anticipated losses from the recent hurricanes. As it relates to hurricane impacts, there will be a modest uptick in NPLs and charge-offs over the next several quarters, primarily driven by consumer and residential loans. In advance of that, this expectation is incorporated into this quarter's allowance bill. ","Overall, we still expect to operate within a 25 basis points to 35 basis points net charge off ratio over the near term, and also continue to forecast the provision level that should roughly approximate net charge-offs. ","Let\u2019s take a look at the balance sheet on slide nine. Average loans were stable sequentially, as growth in consumer lending offset declines in C&I. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew 2%, with broad based growth across most consumer lending products. ","As Bill mentioned earlier, C&I loan balances have been declining, as solid core production is being masked by lower revolver utilization and elevated paydowns. Conversely, we are benefiting from this to some extent, within the capital market business, a good representation of our broad and diverse capabilities. That being said, we are having good dialogue with our clients, as clarity on various policy front develops, we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are well positioned to meet their needs, whether buy a lending, capital markets or other solutions.","Turning to deposits, average client deposits were stable sequentially, and up 3% year-over-year, with growth across most products and both segments. Period imbalances were up 2%, largely due to temporary corporate deposits. Consistent with our commentary in July, the strong deposit growth we've produced over the past several years, in addition to our access to low cost funding, enables us to prudently manage our funding base, and therefore more effectively managed our overall deposit beta. Our goal continues to be to maximize our value proposition outside of [repeat], by meeting more of our clients' needs, via strategic investments in talent and technology.","Slide 11 provides an update to our capital position. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio on a fully phase-in basis was 9.5%, stable with the prior quarter, even after we commenced our 2017 capital plan, which provided for 54% increase in the dividend and a 38% increase in share repurchases.","As a reminder, we issued $750 million of preferred stock in May, and we may look to take advantage of strong market conditions to further optimize our capital stack over the coming quarters. Also, late in the third quarter, the Federal Reserve released the notice of proposed rulemaking, tailored towards simplifying capital rules for regional banks like SunTrust. While we do not currently expect the changes to materially impact our fully phased-in capital ratios, the rules combined with recent legislative proposals in the house incentive, are commendable steps towards tailoring regulation to the actual risk profile and complexity of regulated banks. Efforts we strongly encourage, given our simple and domestic business model.","Let\u2019s take a look at the segment reviews, beginning with Consumer on slide 12, where we continued to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. Our 2% sequential revenue growth was largely driven by net interest income, which was up 3% and 8% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth, in addition to continued improvements in loan mix.","Our targeted investment in consumer lending are consistently yielding good results, and offsetting the declines in home equity balances, evidenced by the 2% sequential and 4% year-over-year increase in average loans.","Non-interest income was down 15% year-over-year, largely due to the lower mortgage related income, given the elevated refinancing activity we saw last year. But more recently mortgage related income has begun to stabilized, which drove the 2% sequential increase in non-interest income. Within [indiscernible] particularly, we\u2019re pleased with the improved momentum we have developed as well as management related revenues beginning to stabilized and to grow slightly. This is a reflection of our client first focus and continued improvement in capabilities, resulting in our ability to attract and retaining top talent and grow AUM. More specifically in the past few months, we've hired teams in New York and Texas, which contributes further to our ability to grow AUM and expands our geographic reach. ","Provision expense did increase on a sequential and year-over-year basis largely due to the reserve build associated with hurricanes in addition to strong loan growth. The hurricanes will also modestly pressure revenue in the coming quarters given relief we\u2019re providing for certain clients by waiving fees and providing payment forbearance consistent with our purpose oriented culture. ","This increase in provision was largely offset by the legal accrual reversals which was the primary driver of the decline in expenses. Overall, we\u2019re making progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the consumer segment evidence in part by continued growth in mobile engagement and usage and the 7% year-over-year reduction in branch cut.","Our ongoing process of integrating mortgage into consumer will also yield further results. By bringing all consumer products and services under one segment, we will be able to create an enhanced client centric approach resulting in a more efficient, effective and improved client experience. ","Moving on to wholesale, we delivered record quarterly revenue and net income in part due to strong markets conditions and a benign credit environment but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we\u2019re having with our clients. Quarterly revenue surpassed $1 billion for the first time and was up 4% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the combined strength of investment banking and trading. ","Growth in investment banking was broad based across most products and client segments. More specifically, M&A and equity two businesses which have been key areas of investment for us each have a record quarter. As we continue to become a more relevant strategic advisor to our clients, we\u2019re not only growing these two advisory businesses at a faster pace than the traditional debt businesses, we\u2019re also increasing our average fee per transaction and reducing our reliance on providing balance sheet, thereby improving our return on equity. In fact, CIB\u2019s ROE in the third quarter was 13.5%. ","Net interest income was also a key contributor to the strong revenue growth, up 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year, as a result of improved loan yields and continued discipline on overall returns. Despite record revenue, non-interest expense was stable sequentially and up 8% compared to the prior year as a result of higher compensation tied to strong revenue growth, the acquisition of Pillar and ongoing investments in technology. ","Specifically, our new loan origination platform is now fully deployed to commercial banking, commercial real estate and private wealth management with deployments to CIB scheduled in early 2018. We also continue to roll out our new treasury and payments platform [indiscernible] to more clients. As a reminder, we announced the sale of our insurance premium finance business back in September and the transaction is scheduled to close in the fourth quarter.","This is a solid performing business but does not fit with our broader wholesale banking strategy and capabilities. And we'll provide details on the financial impact after the transaction closes. But we do not expect it to be material to SunTrust\u2019s overall financial performance and trajectory. ","In conclusion, while market conditions can drive quarterly variability, our differentiated business model and wholesale banking continues to deliver strong results and we expect to see further growth in 2018, particularly if economic growth accelerates and we gain greater clarity around tax refund. ","Additionally, as you may have seen, we have recently announced an expansion of the commercial banking business in to new markets in Ohio and Texas. Given the success that we have had in wholesale, our commercial banking business is following our investment banking and corporate banking businesses into new and high growth markets. ","Now let me turn the call back over to Bill. ","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Aleem. So, to conclude, I\u2019ll forward to slide 14, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis, but more notably also highlights the further opportunity we have across each of these fronts. So first, while the hurricanes did result in an incremental provision impact this quarter, the work that we have done over the past several years to diversify our loan portfolio both by geography and loan type, significantly mitigated the potential risk from Harvey and Irma.","Not only do we benefit from a diverse loan portfolio, but we also have a diverse business mix, which has allowed us to grow revenues despite the significant declines in mortgage production volumes thereby reducing overall earnings volatility. ","Second, I remain confident in our growth outlook and opportunities set. We continue to focus on growing and supporting our key areas of differentiation and this has proven to be highly effective. A little more specifically, investment banking has delivered nearly as much revenue in the first nine months of this year as we did in all of 2016, and further as Aleem mentioned, M&A and equity are performing very well, which I think is a real testament to our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. ","The investments we have made in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are providing excellent experience for our clients in addition to consistent and profitable growth. ","Furthermore, we have made and continue to make, meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth. In the third quarter specifically, we added new capabilities for our mobile and online platforms which reduced manual data entry for our clients and improves their overall experience. ","Mobile deposits and sign-ons are up 20% year-over-year and in the third quarter more than a quarter of our consumer sales occurred via digital channel. Additionally, we are testing and highlight robotic process automation in certain parts of the company and we are expanding our cloud capabilities. Each of these investments will improve the client experience, help us become more efficient and increase our flexibility and speed to market. ","Third, in order to ensure we have adequate capacity to make future investments and growth in technology, we just remain highly focused on improving the efficiency of the company. As Aleem mentioned, we have a number of initiatives in place to help us become even more efficient, some of these are continuation of long-term strategies, while others are an acceleration which require heightened focus in order to achieve our sub-60% target in 2019. ","In addition to improving our efficiency, we also continue to demonstrate a focus on returns, we\u2019re making good progress here as evidenced by 12.5% ROTCE over the last two quarters. ","And lastly our capital position remains strong with common equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.5%. This is even more notable when juxtaposed against our risk profile, where SunTrust consistently demonstrates among the lowest levels of capital erosion in stress test relative to peer banks. The strong risk adjusted capital position afforded us the opportunity to purchase $330 million of common shares in the third quarter and increased our quarterly dividend by 54%. ","While I'm proud of the strong financial performance that we've delivered, I'm equally pleased with the progress in how we delivered against our purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being, and helping more Americans achieve financial confidence. At SunTrust, teammates know purpose and performance are inextricably linked, specifically last quarter we announced the launch of Momentum onUp, which is not-for-profit program that aims to help our corporate and commercial clients equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success. Today we have more than 50 companies enrolled in Momentum onUp and a significant pipeline as our clients realize the link between financial well-being and satisfaction of their employees.","This quarter we also participated in the grand opening of the new Crosstown Concourse in Memphis, a former Seers building turned into a new mixed used development that includes an innovative financial confidence center, where we have staff professionals who provide financial literacy and information in classes to the community. Crosstown is just a great example of how our capabilities and our purpose oriented culture can bring new life and economic growth to the communities we serve.","Overall 2017 is progressing very well and my confidence in all of our teammates to fulfill our purpose and deliver strong financial performance continues to be very high.","Now with that Ankur, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.","Ankur Vyas","Great. Thanks, Bill. Cinthia, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that I\u2019d like to ask the participants, please limit yourself to one primary question, and one follow-up. So that we can accommodate as many as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","I was hoping, you could elaborate a bit on the NIM trending down during quarters where rates aren\u2019t going up, just little bit more in terms of what\u2019s driving that on the funding side? And then kind of tying it together with the balance sheet growth, are you still hopeful that you can grow net interest income dollars, I just [indiscernible] but then just conceptually during quarters where there aren\u2019t rate increases. are you hoping that you can still grow the revenue dollars?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So normally what happens in terms of NIM and in quarters without a rate hike. Partially, this is the roll on roll off effect for C&I. In C&I production yields are still a little bit lower than portfolio yields. So as all loans are often new loans come on, there is a little bit of downward pressure on them. ","And then secondly, remember that deposit rates will continue to creep up a little bit in quarters without a rate hike. So just by the beta -- by the mass effect on beta that\u2019s going to be a little bit of downward pressure on NIM in quarters without a rate hike. But relative to your point about NII, is in general yes. You know overtime, take a look at our last several quarters and you see NII climbing and I think if I look out at the longer term absolutely, I think NII is going to climb both a combination of balance sheet growth and NIM expansion. In any one quarter, maybe yes maybe no. If I look at Q4, you know a little bit of balance sheet growth with a little bit of NIM pressure, that could go either way. I am thinking the NII might be generally flattish in Q4 but if I look out into \u201918 NIM expansion plus loan growth absolutely NII is going to go up I think next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is open. ","John McDonald ","Okay, good morning. I wanted to just follow up on the two questions Matt just ask Aleem just on next quarter\u2019s NIM guidance, what\u2019s the deposit beta assumption you\u2019re kind of incorporating into that?","Aleem Gillani ","We\u2019re thinking something in the mid-20s John. If I look at our cumulative beta over the last couple of years just on interest bearing deposits, its 17% and we think it is going to continue to nudge up a little bit over time. So not sure exactly where it's going to be but we\u2019re modeling something into the 20s now.","John McDonald ","Okay, and then on the balance sheet growth Bill maybe just kind of get your broader thoughts of how you\u2019re sizing up the opportunities and headwinds on loan growth, both on the commercial and the consumer side?","Bill Rogers","Yeah, sure. Let me sort of break that out as you\u2019ve suggested and maybe extrapolate a little bit. You know on the consumer side, we\u2019re pleased with the investments we\u2019ve made and the results we\u2019re seeing and it is up 4% sequentially, 4% year-over-year. We see things like a LightStream where as we noted had a really good production quarter and continues to be a on a good track and obviously up year-over-year in terms of production. ","Credit card balance\u2019s growth is really positive and we\u2019re seeing that. Home equity is still good from a production standpoint but I would say we\u2019re several quarters away from an inflection point there from a growth standpoint. So, on the consumer side, we\u2019re really growing where we want to and the areas that we are growing are accretive to return. ","And the wholesale is a little bit different story and you\u2019ve got to break it down. I think we\u2019ve talked about it before, I look at sort of four variables, I look at production, paydown, utilization and pipelines. And all four of those to think about the wholesale balance sheet portfolio. ","On the production side, we did actually have an increase in the third quarter in production but it's still a little bit off the seven-quarter average. Payoffs are still elevated so we continue to see that and they\u2019re 14% to 15% ahead of the seven-quarter average. But on the payout side, sort of two things related to that, one is as Aleem mentioned, we\u2019ve never been better positioned to take advantage of that in terms of capital markets access, some of the M&A activity that we\u2019re involved in is causing the paydowns, the advent of our syndication capabilities, so we're benefiting on the advice side of the paydowns. ","And then as you know we are also selective, we have got an intense focus on returns and as I mentioned when we are not involved in something, we get a chance to redeploy those assets under something the either has a higher return or return it. ","And then utilization, and utilization did drop-off and particularly in CIB, dropped off about 9 basis points that for us equates to about $0.5 billion in outstanding. So, interesting enough, this quarter's production outpaced payoffs, so that was a little bit of a change and virtually all that decline was in utilization. ","And then the final component is pipelines, so how do we feel about the future, CRE is a little bit down, that wouldn\u2019t be a surprise that sort of market conditions, as well as maybe some selectivity on our part, but CIB in the last 90 days is up and commercial had some of its highest levels of pipelines in the last year. ","So that sort of put that all in a big mix and served around, I\u2019d say we\u2019re growing where we want to, we\u2019re benefiting from the things that we can\u2019t control, like capital markets access. We have maintained our return discipline which is important, and sort of our overall health metrics if you include those things like pipelines are pretty solid. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning guys. On the other side of the corporate side, you obviously had a really strong investment banking result and I just wanted to ask, how much of the kind of the hurt on the commercial loan side, are you seeing show up in the investment banking business, and if you could also just give us your general thoughts on how the pipelines look in that business going forward? Thanks. ","Bill Rogers","It's hard to calculate an exact sort of [our score] to that, but I would say overall its benefited, I mean we can look at the [advice] business that we have been in and the components and the things that drives that income. The momentum in that business is very good, if I look at -- you look over the last since 2010, we have had sort of 10% CAGR most recently, 2014 forward, closer to 16% CAGR. The metrics that we look at, average fee size up significantly, the number of left leads up significantly, really good fundamentals, deep expertise, really good consistency and quality of our talent there, diverse platform more than 40% of the revenue was from M&A equity offerings and equity sales and trading, we\u2019re penetrating the commercial market, that\u2019s up, so we have more runway there, so I am feeling good about the momentum in the business quarter-to-quarter. ","As you know they can have lot of variabilities, I think we have got good momentum headed into the fourth quarter, but maybe more importantly really good momentum headed into the next several years. ","Ken Usdin","Appreciate that. And one quick follow up on the CRE business. We see in the press release that Pillar was lower but also looks like the other sides were lower, can you just help us understand that commercial real estate business and kind of the moving parts of what your confidence is, that\u2019s going to get after a couple tougher quarters?","Bill Rogers","Yeah, there are number of things in their Pillar included SunTrust Community Capital and number of things in there. I would say, in the third quarter, we were not as excited as we want to be, but the fourth quarter is going to be better in that business. It tends to have a fourth quarter seasonality to it. So, we can already sort of see that manifesting itself. What I would say is it relates to pillar is, what I\u2019m really excited about is just the whole -- once we go to market with our commercial real estate, I mean the kind of add backs we\u2019re getting with clients where we are having sort of that mutual introduction where, we\u2019re bringing essentially bridge financing to Pillar, and Pillar is bringing essentially distribution to the commercial real estate side. There might be a little bit of an overhang and fairness on affordable housing as it relates to tax reform and some uncertainty about the tax element of that. But on the other side, we\u2019re just got approved to do some senior housing loans in Pillar. So that really helps our ageing services. So, I still feel really good about it. Again, third quarter is probably a little disappointing in one sense, but in terms of the potential and the opportunity and long-term perspective I'll probably feel better about it now than when we got started.","Aleem Gillani ","Ken, as you know, there is a little bit of seasonality in that business and Q4 is normally a little bit better. So, we are optimistic that Q4 will be better than Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Betsy Graseck","Could we talk a little bit about the efficiency side? You dropped the efficiency ratio quite nicely this quarter, and I just wanted to understand the past, both in the commercial part of the business as well as consumer given some of the investments you\u2019ve been making to drive down the expenses?","Aleem Gillani ","Well for efficiency, overall you know where we are headed. The targets that we\u2019ve set for ourselves and we\u2019re working towards those and we\u2019re working towards those and making investments in both areas, as you said consumer and commercial. I guess first of all, in technology, we\u2019re making investments in consumer technology and you\u2019re going to see some of those actually show up this quarter in the payment space in consumer with the introduction of a new consumer payment product, and in commercial, some of the investments we\u2019ve made have actually just shown up in treasury and payment solutions with the introduction of SunView which we\u2019re rolling out across our commercial client base in several ways, some of which have already been implemented and some of which go into Q4 and Q1. So those are a couple of examples of investments that we\u2019ve made in technology in each one of those spaces in which we\u2019ll continue to improve efficiency. ","I think in other areas Betsy you know that the severance chart that we took in the third quarter, we continue to take a look at it as you would expect, add our total amount of overall business, how our clients are reacting, what it is that they expect from us, and how we respond to that across all kinds of distribution channels, including the human one, and as we think about sort of overall skillsets needed and total amount of team in responding to clients in each of those spaces, we continue to make improvements in structuring the efficiency of each of our businesses from both a front and back office perspective. So, all of that is underway now. ","Betsy Graseck","And the guidance of below 60 in 2019 I mean it seems like you might be on path to hitting them a little bit sooner on an annual basis from what you delivered this quarter or is there something unique in this quarter in the form of maybe high investment banking fees that would keep us going out maybe a slower run rate than you got this quarter.","Bill Rogers","The part that we want to calibrate related to the efficiency ratio and Aleem pointed out you know things on both sides. I mean we have a lot of things to become more efficient but we also want to make sure that we create capacity to continue invest in growth. So similarly, we see just a lot of opportunities also on things that you can see them all across the performance here of things that we think are doing well. I mean we don\u2019t want to not make sure that we\u2019re investing in those businesses and those opportunities. So, this as we said earlier in the year that the latter two quarters would be lower efficiency ratio of quarters because the first two were higher efficiency ratio of quarters and we\u2019re careful about this is not a quarter-over-quarter sort of process. We look at this on an annual basis and we\u2019ll continue to do that, I think next year we\u2019ll say that [indiscernible] ratio will be lower than it was this year and will be on path to being sub-60 with balancing all those things related to achieving the maximum amount of efficiency we can and making sure that we\u2019re investing on our businesses for growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is open. ","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Aleem I wanted to drill down into your discussion about the grind down of the margin given some repricing in the more longer-term portfolios. If I looked across the yields, in CRE and mortgage and the securities portfolio, there each of those kind of fixed rate portfolios are rounding up from second to third quarter. So, I mean you're still continuing to see some positive in those. So where is the actual pressure point in a sense of what you\u2019re talking about for the pressure on the margin going into the fourth quarter?","Aleem Gillani ","Great, thanks Marty. Absolutely between the second and the third quarter you did see a move up in all of those spaces which we expected coming into this quarter given that we\u2019ve got a rate hike in June. So as a result of that rate hike, we were expecting our overall NIM to climb just a little bit this quarter as it did. But in quarters without a rate hike, those are the quarters where we\u2019re looking for NIM to probably grind down a little bit and again not substantially, we\u2019re thinking one to three basis points but we\u2019re grinding down primarily on the asset side is the lone turnover in C&I and where cost is a little bit on the liability side is a little bit of that normal delay you get in deposit repricing in quarters without a rate hike and that\u2019s just from a maths perspective results in a little bit of beta and a little bit of downward pressure on that.","Marty Mosby","The other piece I was looking at was if you looked at the provisioning, even taking out the 30 million from hurricane, consumer has been moving higher and your wholesale has been offsetting that, so it's kind of kept your provisioning in total relatively flat but we\u2019re seeing more you know I don\u2019t see much more improvement in the wholesale that\u2019s available and you are really been growing the consumer portfolio pretty strongly. So, didn\u2019t also was losses already related or are you providing for expected losses in the future for consumer, but how should we expect those two things to kind of keep balancing out going forward?","Bill Rogers","There is a little bit of a mix effect there, you are right. But in general, here is the way I would think about it, in general provision will approximate charge-offs, so not to lock in on one quarter here, because I don\u2019t intend us to be a one quarter point, but this quarter we had $78 million in charge-offs, 21 basis points and so in general the provision is going to approximate that, that would have been about our provision this quarter, ex the effect of the hurricane. ","That going forward, there is a little bit of a mix effect, as we grow consumer banking, as we grow our consumer lending business and there may be slightly higher charge-offs coming out of that business overtime, but we are paying -- we are getting paid for that in terms of higher yields. So, the bottom line effective this is good, even though when you look at that one line, you might see slightly higher charge-offs overtime. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","On the loan growth topic, I appreciate the color you gave us in terms of the pipeline and utilization all that, what does that interpret into loan growth expectation for the quarter, next quarter is it likely to be at this low single digit level again and how does that play into your expectation for 2018, just given the macro backdrop? Thanks. ","Bill Rogers","I don\u2019t think loan growth is going to break out in any one quarter, I mean where the momentum is, so the fourth quarter could be a little bit better than the third quarter, we sort of have to see where things go from that standpoint and as it relates to the long-term, as I said I mean the health metrics that I look at in terms of the pipelines and the performance and the discipline that we have in the system, I think we\u2019ll have to see for 2018. I do fundamentally believe that there are commerce on the sidelines, our clients are healthy, they have got opportunity, I think we have to put variables in their light tax reform and others issues that could be propel us for loan growth in 2018. ","So, we don\u2019t, as you know I mean John, we never guide the loan growth, we look at the health metrics and we look at are we doing the right things for clients and are we achieving the right kind of returns and loan growth is really an outcome of those things and output of those things rather than supplement that we start with as a metric and work backwards from. ","John Pancari","Okay, alright, appreciate that. Back to the credit side, on slide 18, just looking at that delinquencies were up, the 39-day delinquencies were up notably in auto and card on a linked quarter basis. Is that primarily hurricane related, and if not is there any other driver there that you are starting to see? Thanks. ","Bill Rogers","Yes, some of that is hurricane related, right, towards the end of the quarter, but these are early delinquencies and so I wouldn\u2019t necessarily expect that all of these are going to turn into non-performing loans. ","John Pancari","Okay. All right. Lastly, just wondering if I could on the expense side, I know you\u2019re talking about the franchise and you're still looking at the overall system. What is your expectation again for branch consolidation for the coming quarters? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. We\u2019ve done about 7% this year and we will do a little more, we'll start close to sort of the 7.5 kind of range, but remember that sort of net in terms of branch production. So, we\u2019re also opening branches and we\u2019re also renovating and refurbishing branches. And as you know, I think we were an early mover in terms of branch consolidation, which had to do with a lot of factors, not the least of which is the construct of our branch network, which is then faster growing urban market. So that afforded us an opportunity to consolidate faster. And also, the fact that we have in-store and traditional locations. So, we have a lot of different, different, different variables. And we also had a number of branches on the leases. So, we had some advantages I think which allowed us to sort of get started early on this process, and we're now down well north of 20% in terms of branch reductions.","Now going forward a lot of that will be predicated as it was before on client behavior, I would see certainly -- I don't think we'll be at the same pace in 2018 and 2019 that we were in 2017. We probably be more of a steady state somewhere in the 3% kind of range, but in fairness, we'll look at our -- we\u2019re going to follow clients and the investments that we've made in digital, their adoption, particularly our clients, their adoption of those investments, we\u2019ll predicate to where we go, and the same opportunities that we had in the past, we have in the future, I mean we've got a branch network that really lends itself to optimization.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliot","Hello. Good morning. Thank you, sir for taking the question, staying with expenses, on the charges you took this quarter, what sort of earn back do you expect on those, how long is it going to take you to earn back the charges that you took?","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Geoffrey. That\u2019s a good question. Two types of charges there. If you think about the severance component of that charge, the earn back on that typically is four to six quarters. So, it\u2019s relatively quick. And on the technology related charge, so little bit longer, think about that one in terms of kind of six to eight quarters.","Geoffrey Elliot","Okay. Thanks. And then on the 60% target, the tangible efficiency, you said that at a long-time ago when I guess 60% was a long way below the efficiency ratio, you\u2019re running out modestly stretched to some people back then. How do you think about whether it makes sense to come out with a lower number, now that you are kind of closing on the 60%, there\u2019s going to be some courses where you are below, and some courses where you\u2019re above? Does it make sense to give us a lower number and kind of communicate the longer-term aspiration?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Thanks, Geoffrey. You\u2019re right. We did communicate that a number below 60%. Actually, back in 2011, when our efficiency ratio at the time was 72%. So, when it was 72% we said we needed to get to below 60% and that's where we thought we could run the company. Over the course of the last several years, as we become more efficient I think we\u2019re learning more about what the potential is, what the opportunity is and to your point I think it is going to continue to get better. ","So, the first thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to achieve that below 60. We\u2019re going to get those companies to an efficiency ratio that starts with a five, for a full year and when we achieve that target we\u2019re not going to stop. We have a culture now of continuous improvement. Our team may think about efficiency, they think about return every day and everything that they do and we will be looking at what is our opportunity, where should we be running this company and let\u2019s achieve that target and then you can expect we will be setting a new challenge for ourselves. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","I just had one follow-up question and thank you so much for all the responses on the efficiency front. Aleem, as we think about future rate hikes in 2018, balancing your commentary on future betas, how should we think about the value to the NIM of every 25 basis points of rate hike from here?","Aleem Gillani ","Yeah, typically I would think about that as generally on the order of three basis points in that first quarter after a rate hike depending of course on when the rate hike is in the quarter and what we are thinking of Erica in terms of a number of rate hikes for 2018 or let\u2019s say between now and the end of \u201918 as we\u2019re thinking there is probably going to be two. So, over the course of the next 15 months, as we put together our plan right now for 2018 we\u2019re going to be incorporating two rate hikes in that plan. I think the other point to think about also is remember Q1 is also is kind of always a weird quarter in terms of day count and is a little bit beneficial in terms of NIM because of Q1 day count every year.","Bill Rogers","Got it. And that three basis points, how much greater beta does that contemplate relative to the 20ish percent that you indicated you\u2019re assuming for fourth quarter \u201917? We\u2019re going to continue to nudge that up, so we are modeling in slightly higher betas with every rate hike. But always slightly higher. Looking at what client behavior is, how the market is operating and how deliberate and careful the FRB is in terms of rate hikes. I\u2019m not expecting a big spike up in overall betas.","Operator","And that would come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ","Mike Mayo","So, the consumer banking efficiency ratio in the second quarter was 67%. In the third quarter it was 62% and that just is like did you find a magic bullet; did you sprinkle fairly dust and what\u2019s going on there and is that sustainable? So, one question is should we expect that to bounce back or was that abnormally high in the second quarter? Second part of that is what was the retention rate in the branches that you closed in terms of deposits in customers. And then lastly as far as LightStream is that playing a role and how much?","Aleem Gillani ","So, let me start-off with the efficiency ratio point. Yes, there was a big improvement in efficiency ratio quarter-on-quarter, but that\u2019s really caused by or really benefited by the reversal of those legal accruals, several of the items that we settled during the quarter were legacy items that dated back several years, relating to mortgage and one of those benefited the efficiency ratio for consumer for the quarter. ","So, I wouldn\u2019t think about a core efficiency ratio for consumer as 62 immediately, we\u2019re working obviously to get there and better overtime, but I wouldn\u2019t think of that as a Q4 automatic number. ","Bill Rogers","Yes, and then Mike I\u2019ll try to hit with the second part and maybe add-on what Aleem said is, while that was a one-time don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we have had steady improvement there that we\u2019re going to continue to have steady improvement there. So that matched a little bit of the improvement that you see overall. ","As it relates to the brand side and retention, our retention side has been really, really good, so, it's been well north of 90% and that has to do with all of the things that I talked about earlier, it has to do with the density of our branch network and being larger higher growing urban market, so generally we are closing branches that are in close proximity to other branches. ","But it also has to do with not necessarily LightStream, but it does have a lot to do with the investments that we have made in digital and the adoption that we have had from our clients. So, used to be that branch proximity was sort of the highest correlation, but now it's just one of the variables, the other variables are the tenure of the relationship, which as you know we have long tangent relationships and they are not only mobile adoption but there is utilization of the digital platforms, which for us are pretty high. So, you put all those in the variables and the retention rates have been strong. That will get harder as it goes along, right, so as we continue to look at the platform and some of those things change, but so far, our experience has been very good. ","Mike Mayo ","And then just one follow up, at the start of the call, I thought you said record LightStream origination, if that\u2019s the case what\u2019s the potential to use LightStream to eliminate more branch expenses? ","Bill Rogers","It's not really a correlation necessarily with branch expenses, but today something like 25% or so of the originations of LightStream come through the SunTrust platform, so I wouldn\u2019t say there is much of eliminate expenses as it is create additional and incremental opportunity with our clients. So, it's more of the top side of the efficiency ratio, than the bottom side of the efficiency ratio. ","Aleem Gillani ","Yeah Mike, think of LightStream as a whole new distribution channel, a digital channel for connecting with clients and potential clients all over the country, rather than a replacement for the brand channel.

I'll begin with an overview of the second quarter, which we highlight on Slide 4, and then turn it over to Allison for some additional details. I'll conclude with some updates on the merger with BB&T and how our integration planning efforts continue to progress.","Earnings per share this quarter, excluding the $0.03 in merger-related impacts, was $1.51. Contributing to this result was $0.07 on discrete tax benefits, part of which however was offset by reserve build in the quarter. Overall, I would characterize this as a solid quarter, which we had continued good loan growth, an improvement in fee income trends, good expense management and strong credit quality. However, much of this was offset by higher funding cost and a challenging interest rate environment, both of which drove the 11 basis point decline in net interest margin.","With that as an overview, let me highlight some of the specifics for SunTrust earnings in the second quarter. While growth remains healthy evidenced by the 1% sequential growth we delivered, which was generally broad-based across most businesses, the investments we've made in our advice-driven model for corporate, commercial and CRE clients in addition to our ongoing investments in digital consumer lending continue to drive good loan growth.","We also saw healthy growth in indirect auto, reflecting the pullback from certain competitors and strong consumer confidence. Bigger picture, it's clear that our clients remain optimistic about the economy and are committed to making ongoing investments, both personally and in their businesses.","Offsetting the strong loan growth we delivered was pressure on the net interest margin, given increased funding cost and rate dynamics, which Allison is going to discuss in more detail. Excluding certain discrete items, non-interest income increased by 5% sequentially, reflecting increased client activity levels in structured real estate, agency lending and investment banking, all of which highlights the success of our advice-driven model.","Overall, we delivered 1% sequential core revenue growth. This progress, in spite of the NIM pressure we experienced, highlights the diversity of our business model and the returns on our consistent investments in growth. Importantly, our progress in delivering top line growth is mirrored by improvements in overall profitability. Year-to-date, we've delivered 50 basis points of improvement in our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, providing us good momentum headed into the merger and realizing our long-term potential with BB&T.","And, finally, credit quality remains a strength with charge-offs declining by 4 basis points relative to the first quarter and NPLs remain stable. Importantly, our consistently low credit losses are reflection of our underwriting discipline in addition to an economy, which I believe is on solid footing.","While it does appear that the rate environment may become a headwind to our earnings growth going forward, this is partially mitigated by our diversified business model, the ongoing investments we've made and continue to make in growth and technology, and our commitment to continuous improvement and efficiency. Each of these factors give me confidence that we'll continue to make good core business progress over the next one to two quarters on a standalone basis and will then propel us into the next great chapter in our company's history.","Before I turn over to Allison, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the $205 million insurance settlement and offsetting contribution to the SunTrust Foundation. This insurance settlement is from financial crisis area related claims. As you know, we are a purpose-driven company and we decided to contribute the benefit to the SunTrust Foundation, so they may be invested in financial wellness efforts and other activities that will benefit our communities for decades to come.","This contribution, combined with the community benefits plan we announced two days ago, are perfect examples of our strong commitment and dedication to investing in our communities. This has been a core tenet of our respective companies and will only strengthen under Truist.","So, with that, let me turn it over to Allison.","Allison Dukes","Thanks, Bill. Let's start with net interest income. As you can see on Slide 5, our net interest margin is down 11 basis points sequentially and 12 basis points year-over-year. There are few factors driving this.","First, funding cost continue to increase, driven by both an increase in the rate paid on deposits in addition to increased levels of wholesale funding to support the $1.5 billion of loan growth we delivered in the second quarter. Second, one month LIBOR declined by 5 basis points on average in the quarter and approximately 25% of our earning assets, net of debt and commercial loan swaps, are tied with this index.","And, lastly, the roughly 30 basis point average decline in longer-term rates and the roughly 60 basis point point-to-point decline and longer-term rates negatively impacted yields and prepayments in our fixed rate assets, largely mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect net interest margin to decline by 7 to 9 basis points relative to the second quarter. This is primarily driven by our assumption that there will be a July rate cut and our view that deposit betas in the early rate cut will be low, similar to how they were low during the first few rate hikes. In addition, day count higher premium amortization in the MBS portfolio and funding mix shift are also components, albeit smaller, that are embedded in our third quarter guidance.","From an NII perspective, we would expect third quarter NII to decline 0% to 1% relative to second quarter, as loan growth and day count were partially offset the decline in NIM.","Moving to Slide 6. When excluding the $205 million insurance settlement, non-interest income increased by $36 million sequentially, driven primarily by commercial real estate related income, which benefited from higher client activity in structured real estate and agency lending in addition to a $12 million increase in investment banking income.","Mortgage production income was up by $22 million and reflects strength in both refinance and purchase with sequential closed loan volumes up 57% and 81%, respectively. Gain on sale margins are also affirming, given increased industry volumes against reduced capacity. The strength in mortgage production, however, were more than offset by a $36 million decline in servicing income where the more volatile, lower and flatter rate environment negatively impacted hedge performance on our MSR portfolio and drove an increase in the decay expense.","Also, as I discussed on the previous Slide, the lower rate environment negatively impacted reinvestment yields and prepayments on the mortgage loan portfolio in the second quarter. Looking to the third quarter, we would expect total mortgage-related fee income to decline from the second quarter levels as refinance activity may abate and purchase seasonally decline, while servicing income will continue to have elevated decay as over cost [indiscernible] decay expense on the servicing portfolio is recorded at close, while gain on sale within production income is recorded at the time of rate loss.","Separately, as we had indicated in our first quarter earnings call, we sold an accruing residential TDR portfolio in the middle of April, which resulted in a $44 million gain. This was largely offset by a $42 million loss related to the repositioning of approximately $3 billion of our securities portfolio. As I said in April, the net P&L impact will be relatively immaterial to our earnings profile going forward.","Moving to expenses, on Slide 7. We recognized $14 million of merger-related impacts on the second quarter: $8 million primarily related to legal fees would show up as merger-related costs and $6 million primarily related to consulting expenses would show up in other non-interest expense. We would expect total merger-related expenses to be in the $10 million to $15 million range in the third quarter. We also had $205 million contribution to the SunTrust Foundation, offsetting the insurance settlement, which Bill mentioned earlier.","Excluding the contribution and merger-related impacts, expenses decreased by $25 million sequentially as a result of lower operating losses in the second quarter and elevated branch closure costs in the first quarter. Compared to the prior year, adjusted expenses increased by $29 million, or 2%, driven by higher compensation expense in addition to ongoing investments in technology. Importantly, these investments in talent and technology were largely funded by ongoing efficiency initiatives.","We also recorded $32 million of discrete tax benefits this quarter related to the resolution of certain tax matters. Excluding these benefits, our effective tax rate would have been approximately 17%. Looking to the third quarter, we would expect our effective tax rate, excluding any discrete items, to be between 17% and 18%, and between 19% and 20% if you model us on an FTE basis.","As you can see on Slide 8, the adjustable tangible efficiency ratio was 59% for the quarter. Year-to-date, we've delivered 50 basis points of improvement in the adjusted tangible efficiency ratio, which is good progress, especially when considering the 4 basis point decline in our net interest margin for the first half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2018.","More importantly, given the synergies we will achieve by merging with BB&T, we will have significantly greater capacity to invest in innovation, technology and talent. This is one of the key benefits of this transaction, not just that we have the opportunity to achieve best-in-class efficiency, which is of course a great outcome for our shareholders, but more so to have incremental capacity for investments.","Now moving to Slide 9. Our net charge-off ratio was 22 basis points in the second quarter, down 4 basis points relative to the first quarter. The low level of net charge-offs reflects the relative strengths we are seeing across all of our portfolios, performance we are extremely pleased with that we remain cognizant that there could be some variability and normalization going forward.","Our non-performing loan ratio of 34 basis points, which is stable relative to the prior quarter also remained well below historical averages. Provision expense declined by $26 million sequentially as a result of slower loan growth, relative to the first quarter and lower net charge-offs.","Looking into the third quarter of 2019, we would expect our net charge-off ratio to be on the low-end of our 25 to 30 basis point guidance. We do expect the ALLL ratio to remain relatively stable, which would result in a provision expense that exceeds net charge-offs given loan growth.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 10. We continue to [indiscernible] have good loan growth, evidenced by the 1% sequential growth in average balances. Importantly, that growth was diversified across most portfolios, including C&I, CRE, consumer direct and indirect auto. Wholesale growth was diversified across each of our lines of business.","Within CIB, loan growth was broad-based across many of our industry verticals in addition to growth in our asset finance business. Commercial banking growth was also broad-based with strength across most client segments, including auto dealer, aging services, our expansion markets and core commercial clients.","CRE growth continued at the result of investments we have made in permanent lending and bridge lending capabilities, which is being partially offset by run-off within the construction portfolio. Within consumer, the ongoing investments we have made in our digital and point-of-sale lending capabilities, which provide for a superior client experience, are also driving good growth and enhancing our returns. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate healthy growth and solid risk-adjusted returns.","Across both wholesale and consumer, our underwriting discipline has not changed and we remain highly focused on ensuring that the quality of our new production is consistent with the quality of our existing portfolio.","On the deposit side, average balances were stable sequentially. Consistent with prior quarters, we continue to see a migration from lower cost deposits to CDs, largely due to higher rates and our targeted strategies, which allows us to retain our existing depositors while also acquiring new households.","Interest-bearing deposit costs increased by 6 basis points sequentially, lower than the prior two quarter increases of 9 and 10 basis points, respectively. This quarter's increase in deposit costs reflects, to some extent, the lagged impact from prior rate hikes.","Now moving to Slide 11 to provide an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.2% and the Tier 1 ratio was 10.2%, slightly higher than the prior quarter given the suspension of share repurchases. Book value and tangible book value per share increased by 5% and 6% sequentially, given the growth in retained earnings and the impact that lower rates had on improving the unrealized loss position in our securities portfolio. Going forward, we expect capital ratios to trend upward given the suspension of share repurchases in anticipation of our merger with BB&T.","Separately, subject to Board approval, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per common share to $0.56 per common share beginning in the third quarter, which represents a 12% increase, provide for an attractive pro forma dividend yield of 3.5%, and reflects our confidence and our standalone earnings capacity.","Moving to the segment overviews, we'll begin with the consumer segment on Slide 12. A positive lending momentum we had in consumer continued in the second quarter with consumer lending production, excluding mortgage, achieving a record level and up 16% year-over-year. The investments we've made in LightStream and our point-of-sale lending partnership continued to be consistent contributors to our loan growth.","Over the past year, we have focused on enhancing our analytics, improving automation, adding product offerings and growing our partnerships in referrals, all of which are key contributors to the 40% year-over-year growth we delivered in LightStream.","Consistent with prior quarters, some of this collective growth has been offset by the continued decline in home equities. We are encouraged by the growth we have with our direct consumer lending businesses, which provides us with great momentum headed into our proposed merger, where we will have the opportunity to meet the digital lending needs of a broader set of clients.","Overall, the 6% loan growth and 1% deposit growth [indiscernible] the 4% increase in net interest income relative to the prior quarter -- relative to the prior year. Consumer fee income benefited from the $44 million gain related to the sale of an accruing residential TDR portfolio. Excluding this, fee income was relatively stable sequentially and year-over-year. As mentioned earlier, mortgage-related income declined by $14 million sequentially as the increase in production was more than offset by lower servicing income, given the impact the rate environment had on decay expense and hedge performance for MSR portfolio.","Wealth management-related non-interest income increased 4% sequentially as market conditions improved. Assets under management are up a solid 4% year-over-year. Excluding the TDR sale, our efficiency ratio in consumer improved by 170 basis points year-over-year. Relatedly our branch count is down by 6% in the past year. These efficiencies have been used to make ongoing improvements in technology.","SmartGUIDE, our digital mortgage application, has achieved an almost 90% adoption. We're now working to streamline aspects of the back-end origination process as well. The early results are very encouraging. We've received another Online Banking Award from Javelin in the second quarter, continuing our positive results with regards to third-party digital recognition.","Big picture, our consumer business continue to make very good progress. Excluding the TDR gain, revenues are up 3% year-over-year, expenses are stable and pre-provision net revenue was up 8% year-over-year. These businesses continue to benefit from the strong presence across high growth markets in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic in addition to our continued progress in enhancing digital and technology capabilities.","Each of these strengths will be amplified when we merged with BB&T, creating retail and private wealth businesses that will be leaders in the industry across many key dimensions; growth, efficiency, talent and technology. Now moving to wholesale on Slide 13 where our consistent strategy continues to drive good results.","On the lending side, we saw solid growth across CIB, Commercial and CRE. More broadly, the growth in our wholesale lending portfolio is a reflection of our clients' continued optimism in the economy, which has resulted in higher utilization rates and strong production levels. Paydown activity did increase, as anticipated, which drove slower loan growth relative to the first quarter.","Importantly, the loan growth did not come at the expense of risk or return discipline. Our model is focused on leading with advice, not structure or price. This is also reflected in our low net charge-off ratio, which was 5 basis points in the second quarter. It has remained below 20 basis points for each of the last 10 quarters.","As mentioned previously, commercial real estate-related income was a key driver of the 11% sequential and 4% year-over-year growth in fee income. In particular, this was driven by increased transaction activity in CIB structured real estate business and CRE's agency lending business. We continue to benefit from strong client relationship and deep structuring expertise in the structured real estate business and we're now seeing improved momentum from our agency lending business, given increased partnership between our coverage bankers and our product specialists.","We also saw an improvement in investment banking income relative to the first quarter, driven by a pick up an equity offering, a good sign of investor confidence and, more importantly, a good reflection of our increasing strategic relevance with our clients. Trading income had a strong quarter and was broad-based across most product categories.","While provision expense did prevent a headwind to net income, a strong revenue growth we have delivered in the first half of the year, combined with ongoing expense discipline, drove a 4% increase in pre-provision net revenue year-to-date. Bigger picture, we've made consistent strategic investments in building out our products and industry expertise, expanding our product offerings and expanding into new markets, the success of which is demonstrated in our results.","First, in CRE, the strong loan growth we are seeing as a result of our recently introduced permanent financing and bridge lending capabilities, combined with the aforementioned growth in fee, is making this business a more meaningful and diversified contributor to wholesale earnings. In commercial banking, we continue to have success with the national expansion of our aging services vertical in addition to the expansion of our core commercial business into new markets in Texas and Ohio. Combined, these two areas of investment contributed to approximately 40% of our year-over-year loan growth in commercial banking.","And, finally, in capital markets, our revenues from non-CIB clients are up 8% year-to-date. Importantly, this increased level of connectivity we have across wholesale in the success of our one team approach are creating a more sustainable and granular source of capital markets revenue. Each of these strategies continues to drive solid sustainable results and has created a strong foundation, which we can build upon as we merge, and have the opportunity to bring our capabilities and differentiated model to a broader set of corporate and commercial clients.","And, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Great. Thanks, Allison. Overall, we had a good quarter and it was further a validation of the success we continue to have in investing in growth opportunities, diversifying our business mix and loan portfolio, and improving our efficiency. While the rate environment match much of our core business progress, we feel good about the underlying momentum across the company.","The overall momentum we have continue to validate my view that SunTrust, on a standalone basis, is approaching the proposed merger with BB&T from a position of strength. Individually, we are two strong companies; and, together, we're creating the premier financial institution.","With that, let me provide a bit of progress and update on the merger and most of that's on Slide 14. Overall, we're very pleased with how well the progress is proceeding and, more importantly, how well our teams are working together. We've developed strong levels of partnership and alignment and there is just a really strong sense of excitement for the future opportunities we're going to have together as Truist.","The executive management team continues to meet weekly to plan for the merger and those conversations are going extremely well. Together, we're making good progress on key decisions about important issues like organizational design, system selections, desired future state and decisions that really help to find our new culture.","Relatedly, we have two cascades of organizational announcements, which named approximately 1,000 leaders. These leaders reflect top talent from both companies, a really, really great balance between BB&T and SunTrust, good levels of diversity from every perspective, including background, the experience.","From an integration standpoint, we have approximately 50 work streams underway. We've identified several thousand application between the two companies. We group them into 100 or so ecosystems. We're now beginning the system selection process. This requires a great amount of thoughtfulness and we're focus on selecting the best of the best, while also mitigating integration risk.","On the regulatory front, we continue to work closely with the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the DOJ. We submitted our joint capital plan at the beginning of May. In addition, our teams have really been working well together to provide timely responses to the request for information.","We made several key announcements regarding our community investment levels. First, we announced that we would double our community investment and philanthropy levels in our respective headquarter cities of Atlanta and the Piedmont Triad area. Second, on Tuesday, we announced our community benefits plan, which calls for $60 billion of investment across multiple dimensions over the next three years.","And, today, we announced an incremental $205 million contribution to the SunTrust Foundation. Combined, these announcements should reinforce our commitment to supporting and investing in the communities in which we're really fortunate to be a part.","Kelly and I thought about this merger not just in the context of the next three to five years, but really the next generation, and these investments are going to strengthen all of those communities for decades to come. We're working very hard to lay the groundwork for the new company culture. This is a significant amount of work underway, which was formally launched with a culture survey between both companies back in May.","The results of this survey and additional work are really encouraging. It only reinforces our belief that these two companies are far more like than they are different. Our team is going to dive deep into the results and discuss more about what we want true is to represent. This is really rewarding work that we're doing together.","And, finally, perhaps the most important accomplishment in the first quarter was the announcement of our new name, Truist. That was a culmination of an extensive and thoughtful and rigorous process. Right now, Truist, of course, is just a name, but from here it's what we're going to make it. We're really excited about the opportunity to come together and make Truist one of the strongest brands in financial services.","So you can see we've been quite busy the last few months and I can say, personally, that it's been some of the most fun, rewarding and fulfilling work in my career. There are a number of important activities and gating items that must be achieved in the next few months. And, at this point, we're targeting a close late -- maybe in the third quarter or early fourth quarter.","Overall, I'm just really incredibly pleased with the progress we've made in such a short period of time. More importantly, the more time we spend together as a new management team, the more than our team to work together, we're just becoming more optimistic about the opportunity that we have in front of us. We know that Truist will do so much more to our clients, our teammates, our associates, communities and shareholders than we could have ever done on our own and we look forward to executing on this incredible potential.","Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't thank our teams. I know how hard everyone is working to serve our clients every day, deliver results for our shareholders and invest in our communities, all while planning for this important merger. Everyone, have a lot on their plate, but our team also know that you're part of making history.","So, with that, let me turn it back over to you, Ankur.","Ankur Vyas","All right. Thank you, Bill. David, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask just near-term question for Allison. Could you give us a little more color, Allison, on the drivers of the NIM pressure, near-term, between short and long rates when you think about next quarter, maybe the fourth? What pressure is coming from the short-end and what's coming from long route on the curve?","Allison Dukes","Sure. Thanks, John. Why don't I -- let me answer that with just what's kind of -- behind the guidance of the 7 to 9 basis point decline to NIM for the third quarter. The majority of that is our assumption that we would get a 25 basis point decline in rates in July, the two months of that and combined with that we actually expect deposit costs to be pretty stable in the third quarter relative to the second quarter.","So our expectation is that deposit betas will initially lag for the first rate cut or two, just as they did on the way up. And so that in and of itself is about 5 basis points of the decline and that's really obviously the impact of the short-term there. There are few other components and our guidance, day count, as I mentioned, is a headwind of a basis point. We would expect premium am to continue increasing in the MBS portfolio and that's about a basis point as well.","And then, finally, if loan growth continues to outpace deposit growth, then we would fund that with wholesale funding, which is a positive for NII, but it is a negative for net interest margin. So our expectation is really more around the impact to the short-end of the curve, it's less focused on the long-end with an assumption that a lot of that has been priced into the long-end of the curve at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, Bill and Allison. Just a question on the fee side. Good to see the investment banking bounce after that slowish first quarter and, Al, I think you mentioned about the connectivity continuing to increase. Can you talk about just how the pipelines look? I think in your prepared comments in the release, you mentioned that syndicate in financings were down year-over-year, what's the status of the financing market in the businesses that are most important to you guys as far as the pipeline? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. Ken, thanks. The good news, as you highlighted, is our model now is very diversified, so we don't sort of have one dependency of one segment of our business. 10 years ago that would have been much more highly weighted towards the financing market, now with equity in this quarter being strong, M&A having a really good pipeline for the latter half of the year, we feel good about where we are in the business, pipelines are generally solid, they are solid across the areas like M&A, they are solid across the areas like equity and the places that really are driven by the advice.","So the places where we're in with clients in driving really strong discussions with CEOs and Boards and being advice-driven as part of what's motivating that. We had good increase in less leads, deal count with our investment grade bond market was good. So I think the good news is, I feel positive about the next half of the year. It's hard to sort of do this by quarter, but I feel really good about the next half of the year and I feel good because we've got more than one cylinder, we've got several cylinders that are firing.","Operator","Next question will be from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions. One, wanted to just touch base on the commercial loan growth. You had nice solid growth this quarter and wanted to understand if you feel like there was an opportunity for that to ramp. We've seen some other folks with even faster levels of C&I loan growth and you've typically been a stand out in this space. So wanted to get a sense as to what's going on there?","Bill Rogers","Betsy, we sort of -- I don't plan the loan growth. We sort of planned the business activity and I sort of start with looking at what's happening with production. Production on both the first quarter and the second quarter were strong. As a matter of fact, production in the second quarter was ahead of the first quarter. So if I look at sort of core business and where we are from a growth standpoint, I feel really good about that.","Paydowns were a little higher in the second quarter, so that sort of got the balance up a little bit differently, and it was really broad-based, really good growth, and CIB, good growth from the asset finance, good growth back to the last question on advice-based businesses, so CapEx, M&A, revolver utilization was just like the second quarter and a little higher than it's been in the past several quarters.","Commercial was also really solid and a lot of the places where we targeted investments like aging services and new markets CRE was up, as Allison noted, on new capabilities and then, of course, the consumer side really benefiting from the investments we've made and LightStream and partnerships and some of the changes that we've seen in the auto side, which is a good reflection of consumer health.","So I don't think about loan growth quarter-to-quarter really, I think about it sort of production and pipelines and those all feel really good. If we just said, gosh, the first quarter was exceptional, we would have said that was really, really high growth and we would have said, gosh, what does that mean relative to getting things and we like to look at it over a period of time to feel like the fundamentals are really solid for us.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And then follow-up on credit in the consumer portfolio. You've got a lot of different types of lending relationships, you've got direct via the branch, you've got via the call center, you've got via the mobile web, you've got via partners, retail partners. Could you give us a sense as to how you're seeing differences between those different channels or customer types or how credit is differentiated if at all either on delinquencies or charge-offs. Is there any sense of differentiation-based on channel and engagement with the client on the consumer side?","Allison Dukes","Yes, thanks. Betsy, this is Allison. No. I'd say the short answer is, no. We don't see a difference in credit quality as it relates to the sourcing of loan growth across different channels. Certainly, there is different risk-adjusted return profiles across some of our different asset classes.","I'd say just even in LightStream last year, as we started to shift our strategy to increase production to different purpose loans inside of LightStream, specifically home improvement and debt consolidation, you do start to see slight differences in terms of the charge-off profile, but with that you get much stronger risk-adjusted return. So we really look at our asset quality across different products and we don't see a difference in the actual credit quality itself across different channels. We use the exact same risk appetite profile and credit approval process regardless of channels.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Thanks for that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Hey, guys.","Bill Rogers","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Hi. It seems like the outlook on the tax rate is a little bit lower than what your thought before. I'm just wondering what drives that? And then, more importantly, do those factors carry forward to the combined company?","Allison Dukes","Yeah, sure. Thanks, Matt. The outlook has been evolving, I would say, in the 18 months or so since tax reform was passed just as we continue to refine our planning in a different environment relative to our expectations in first half of 2018. I think we started to really hone in on what our tax profile would look somewhere around the end of 2018, beginning of 2019.","Obviously, we had some discrete tax benefits this quarter; but the guidance, I gave 17% to 19% is our standalone tax expectation. In terms of what that will look like for Truist, it's too early to say. There is going to be a significant amount of planning and tax strategy, obviously, once we bring the two profiles together.","Matt O'Connor","And, sorry, just to clarify, the tax rate for the third quarter, was it 17% to 18% or 17% to 19%?","Allison Dukes","It was 17% to 18%. And then if you model us on an FTE basis, it's 19% to 20% just in terms of third quarter expectations and pretty consistently from there.","Matt O'Connor","Got it. And the 17% to 18%, I think is down from the 18% to 20% on the same basis right?","Allison Dukes","It is. I mean, it's modestly down if you go back a few quarters, but it really is as we've just continue to refine our planning.","Matt O'Connor","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Bill, you mentioned closing late third quarter or early fourth quarter, whereas I thought the closing before was going to be in late third quarter until the end of the year. So am I interpreting that correctly? Why the increased confidence on the time of closing?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I -- don't over interpret what I've said, because we're obviously not in control of that final date. I'm just making the comment based on the work that we've done and the back and forth that we're having and -- but we don't have any indication that it's going to be at any particular time.","Mike Mayo","Okay. Then I have a personal question for both you, Bill, and Allison. Allison -- just between us. So, Allison, you are not making the trip to the new firm, and so for the time the merger was announced till now you decided not to do so. And if you could just share what -- differently what's your thought process, because that's a question some people ask?","And then Bill, you're going to have to take a backseat for a while, you've been CEO all decade and now you're going to be the number two person and that can't be very easy. So how are you going to manage that? What if Kelly says, hey, invest here, and you say, don't invest and you're overruled, that's not an easy situation to be in. Thank you.","Allison Dukes","Okay. How about I think this one first. I'd say extremely consistent with exactly what we conveyed on our call back in April. I made the decision in that time frame and that's for a very personal reasons. From a geographic standpoint, we wanted to remain in Atlanta. And so that was a difficult decision and one that I obviously didn't take lightly and I'm incredibly excited about the opportunity SunTrust and BB&T have to come together. But, for me, it was the right thing for me to do to remain in Atlanta and there was nothing more or less behind that decision.","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I just say as regards to Allison think, she is not a bigger fan than Bill Rogers and whatever she does, I hope I get a chance to invest in it. So I just thought of -- say that and exactly as she described. In terms of me personally, I mean, obviously, I entered into this with that full knowledge and if it's taken a small step backward to take a great leap forward, I feel great about it.","And, in fairness, I feel better about it every day. I mean, I might not have done this with everybody, but I was willing to do with Kelly King, because he is a great partner, I have a lot of respect for him, we share a lot of the same hopes and dreams for the future and operate in a lot of similar matters. He'll be the CEO, I'm not confused about that.","We have a transition plan, which will be great. Kelly and I will want all of that to be seamless. So, nobody is even going to miss a beat as part of that. So, in fairness, it was my choice and I did it with a great partner and every day we're working on this together I feel better about my choice.","Mike Mayo","And then last follow-up, if I could. When you disagree, which if you're not disagreeing maybe you're not expressing a view and if you're going to disagree at times, how do you handle those disagreements? What's the process between you and Kelly, and maybe other senior managers?","Bill Rogers","So, first of all, I mean we both have a collaborative approach. So what I like is, we both have the same approach. We like to take a lot of opinions. We like to reach consensus as best we can. But, look, when the buck stops, the buck stops. And there is one CEO and that's clear, and I'll be a great partner in that process. I haven't -- we literally haven't had a situation yet.","Not that we didn't disagree or that we didn't have different views, but that we didn't have a great resolution and I think the best evidence is look at the amount of decisions we're making today already. I mean these are the hardest decisions you'll make in a career, talent and resources and capital investment and systems and we're doing all that in a condensed timeframe and I think doing it really extremely well. And I feel -- I just -- I couldn't feel better about my decision.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hey, guys. Wanted to ask, in terms of the current environment, when we think about deposit growth, are you feeling a tangible impact from other banks and non-banks that are using national digital strategies and offering competitive rates? Is that impacting your deposit growth and pricing strategies?","Allison Dukes","Yeah. I wouldn't say, John, that it's impacting growth. It certainly impacts our strategy and the overall competitive pricing dynamics that are out there and so we pay attention to it. We look at it as we look at all of our different competitors, those that are more traditional competitors and these non-traditional competitors. I mean, I don't think it's having a material impact on it yet.","And I think it's going to be interesting to watch it in a down rate environment. It is -- this is -- way lot of folks are doing it, we're all learning from it and we're certainly learning, watching from a competitive standpoint as well.","John McDonald","Okay. If I could ask Bill in terms of technology, when you think about Truist, one of the drivers of the deal was to have more money to invest in technology. What are SunTrust historical strength in the area of technology and maybe gaps and what are BB&T's on the other hand?","Bill Rogers","Yeah, I mean, the really great part of this process is that we just have a lot of complementary strengths that we can -- we're doing these best of breed type selections. If you sort of put them in some big categories, BB&T has really invested significantly in the last several years in the core infrastructure data center and I would say sort of world-class capabilities and that's more of like an opportunity thing that you don't have to invest in the future, because now we have something that we can come to that has lots and lots, lots, lots of capacity, things like GL they've invested insignificantly.","So we migrate to a new GL, that's another opportunity that SunTrust wouldn't have to invest in over the next decade. I think we come to it with some strengths and areas like LightStream as an example; sort of on the digital side, we come to some strengths with usage of APIs and things like SmartGUIDE, some cloud-based technologies. So we sort of get the best of both worlds. We get a really, really strong infrastructure and then this -- how do you create agility and speed relative to that infrastructure. I think we both bring really, really good strengths and every day we're at this you can just see more opportunities in that regard.","John McDonald","Got it. And if I could just sneak in one more. If we think about the SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Bill, I guess near-term, what's your outlook for the second half of the year on the capital markets environment? And then looking out to Truist, is that an opportunity to cross-sell into BB&T where those folks might not have seen that kind of exposure before?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. As -- I think the second half of the year will be better than the first half of the year based on everything I see right now in momentum and pipelines and general business focus and places where we've invested and absolutely it will be one of the really tremendous opportunities with Truist and those plans are underway, those discussions are going on, we're creating infrastructure and planning, then on how we'll make that happen, the BB&T associates are really excited about expanding their capacity and capabilities and the SunTrust teammates are really excited about working together in creating an incredible momentum, an incredible opportunity for clients of both companies. So I think it's actually one of the top things that will be focused on.","John McDonald","Thanks.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hey. Thanks, guys. Just I had one follow-up on the commercial real estate business. BB&T has been kind of calling their business down, it's been one of your best growth areas in the last year or so, albeit from a very low base, and then also this quarter we saw what was I think maybe a record or one of the best CRE income fee lines, how do you guys just thinking about continue to push on that growth and what it might look like on the CRE side when you get inside the combined company?","Bill Rogers","Yeah. I think I'm sure there is a lot of alignment. The -- if you sort of look at the places, so -- where BB&T is down and the same areas that we're down, construction would be an example. So that sort of front-end part, we don't view the world sort of any differently about where things are going.","We strategically built capacity for bridge lending related to agency product, permanent loans for stabilized properties, credit secured by multi-diversified pool. So we have a strategy that's related. But I don't think that's any indication that we have a different view on real estate and CRE. I should just view it as an opportunity to come together and create more capacity in that area.","And then on the fee side, that's just strategies that we've had in structured real estate and I would think those would be strategies that will continue in Truist. As a matter of fact, I think we'll have more opportunity on that side, on the fee side. So I don't view it as a difference. It's just another example of the complementary businesses that we're bringing together with SunTrust and BB&T.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","David, it looks like there are no more questions in the queue. So this concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the IR department.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. You may now disconnect."],"20037":["SunTrust Banks, Inc.

Welcome to the SunTrust Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the conference call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead, sir.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Tony. Good morning and welcome to SunTrust third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. Please refer to the cautionary statements on Page 2 of our presentation regarding forward-looking information, including some of the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the Company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release or in our presentation and on our website Investors.suntrust.com.","Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third-parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Ankur, and good morning everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the third quarter, which we highlighted on Slide 3, and then I'll turn it over to Allison for some additional details. Reported earnings per share was $1.34, and when excluding merger related impacts from the quarter earnings per share was $1.40. Overall, we had a good quarter, particularly as it relates to the strength in a number of our fee income oriented businesses and continued balance sheet growth, both of which are reflective of our successful execution against the strategic initiatives of our consumer and wholesale segments.","We also continue to benefit from strong asset quality performance as a result of our consistent underwriting discipline and a favorable economic environment. However, as we guided last quarter, the lower rate environment drove further pressure on our net interest margin offsetting much of the core growth we delivered in loans, deposits and non-interest income.","With that as an overview, let me highlight some of the specifics for SunTrust earnings in the third quarter. Loan growth remains healthy, evidenced by the 1% sequential growth we delivered, which was generally broad-based across most businesses. The investments we've made in delivering product and industry expertise to our corporate commercial and CRE clients in addition to our ongoing investments and digital consumer lending, continue to drive good loan growth.","We're also seeing healthy growth in indirect auto, reflecting strong consumer confidence. Bigger picture, our clients remain relatively optimistic about the economy and are committed to making ongoing investments in their personal lives and in their businesses. So the level of uncertainty has increased, leading to some caution. We also saw strong deposit growth in the quarter, which was largely driven by good results from our corporate liquidity products team in addition to solid growth in consumer deposits. Offsetting the balance sheet growth we delivered was pressure on the net interest margin given rate dynamics, which Allison will discuss in more detail.","Excluding certain discrete items, non-interest income increased by 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, reflecting increased client activity levels in mortgage, investment banking, commercial real estate and private wealth, most of which is reflective of the successful execution against our strategies and is also a good representation of the diversity of our business mix. Overall, revenue was stable sequentially, as this diversity helped to offset the 10 basis point decline in our net interest margin. Importantly, our continued execution against expense initiatives across the Company has allowed us to keep our efficiency ratio stable year-to-date, in spite of the challenging interest rate environment. This base performance puts us on good footing heading into the merger, where efficiency opportunities are significantly amplified. And finally, credit quality remains a strength with charge-offs and non-performing loans remaining below their historical averages.","When excluding the impact of interest rate environment, I continue to be pleased with the core performance of both our consumer and wholesale businesses. We've developed and continued to enhance our competitive advantage in certain differentiated businesses like SunTrust Robinson Humphrey and LightStream. We continue to make good progress in enhancing the digital experience we're providing for our clients and remain focused on leading with advice-driven model for our clients, particularly in our wholesale and private wealth businesses. These are just a few of the reasons why we entered into our proposed merger vehicles with BB&T from a position of underlying strength with an offensive mindset. The ability to bring together two highly complementary business models with different areas of relative strength and opportunity, I think it is unique to this particular combination.","At the same time, the overall revenue environment has changed, which also underscore some of the defensive merits of our merger, including the synergy opportunities in our balance sheet positioning. As we all know championships teams have great offenses and great defenses. In this regard I think Truist is uniquely well positioned. Momentum for Truist continues to build and I'll conclude with further details on the progress we're making in our integration planning efforts, in addition to some of the key items we hope to accomplish in the first 100 days as Truist.","Before I turn it over to Allison, I want to highlight the announcement we made last week that Linnie Haynesworth was appointed to the SunTrust Board of Directors, and she will also serve on the Truist Board of Directors. Linnie was the leader in the Cyber and Intelligence Mission Solutions divisions for Northrop Grumman and she'll bring a wealth of knowledge to our Board as it relates to cyber security, technology and innovation, all critical skill sets in creating a strong foundation for Truist and financial security and confidence for our clients.","So with that, let me turn it over to Allison.","Allison Dukes","Thanks, Bill. Let's start with net interest income. As you can see on Slide 4, our net interest margin declined 10 basis points sequentially, which was slightly lower than our previous guidance, primarily driven by short-term rates and long-term rates, but declined more than we anticipated in July. As a reminder, one month LIBOR impact approximately 22% of our earning assets, net of debt and commercial loan swaps. And short-term benchmark rates to decline throughout August, as the probability of a September rate cut increased in late July. Second long-term rates declined approximately 50 basis points on average, which negatively impacted yields and prepayments in our fixed rate assets, largely mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans.","Net interest income declined by $25 million sequentially or 1.6%, as good loan and deposit growth only partially mitigated the impact of the decline in the interest rate. On a standalone basis, I would expect our net interest margin to decline by 2 basis points to 5 basis points in the fourth quarter given the impact of the September rate cut. We do expect deposit cost to begin to turn the corner and decline as we look into the fourth quarter. But overall margin will still decline given the aforementioned net exposure to short-term interest rates.","Now moving to Slide 5, when excluding the insurance settlements in the second quarter and a $5 million residual benefit in the third quarter, non-interest income increased by $18 million sequentially, driven primarily by mortgage income, which benefited from higher refinancing activity and improved gain on sale margins, in addition to strong investment banking performance where we saw increased origination activity within debt capital market and strength in M&A. Separately, there were several discrete gains in the third quarter from strategic FinTech equity investments and net securities gains. These gains were largely offset by $14 million negative adjustment to counterparty credit valuation reserves in connection with our interest rate derivatives portfolio for client hedging activity, primarily as a result of lower rate.","Moving to expenses on Slide 6, we recognized $33 million of merger-related impacts in the second quarter, $22 million of these were specific merger-related costs driven by legal and professional services, in addition to the write-down of certain technology development projects and progress, which were decommission. Another $11 million of costs were incurred primarily related to consulting expenses associated with the merger, which generally show up in other non-interest expense. Excluding the merger-related impacts, expenses increased by $22 million, sequentially as a result of higher compensation costs in part due to one extra day in the quarter and higher operating losses in the quarter. Compared to the prior-year core expenses increased by 4%, driven by higher compensation expense, partially in connection with the 7% increase in core non-interest income in addition to ongoing investments in technology.","Importantly, these investments and talent and technology were largely funded by ongoing efficiency initiatives, which you can see on Slide 7. The adjusted tangible efficiency ratio was 59.9% for the quarter and year-to-date, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio is stable relative to 2018. Despite year-over-year stability, we feel good about these results, given our forecast at the beginning of the year included two rate increases, whereas we have instead experience two rate cut with the possibility of more. More importantly, given the synergies and scale, we will achieve by merging with BB&T, we will have significantly greater capacity to invest in technology, talent and innovation. As one of the key benefits of this transaction, not just that we have the opportunity to achieve best-in-class efficiency, which is of course a great outcome for our shareholders, but more so to have incremental capacity for investment.","Now moving to Slide 8. Our net charge-off ratio was 28 basis points in the third quarter, up 6 basis points relative to the second quarter. Our non-performing loan ratio was 38 basis points, up 4 basis points relative to the prior quarter. The drivers of the increases in charge-offs and NPLs were generally idiosyncratic and also a reflection of credit metrics being at absolute low and benign level. On a standalone basis, we still expect our full-year net charge-off ratio to be between 25 basis point and 30 basis point. Over time, however, we believe that net charge-off ratios are more likely to have an upward trajectory rather than downward, simply given how strong performance has been in recent years combined with the fact that there are increased levels of macro-economic, political and global uncertainty.","Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 9. We continue to deliver good loan growth, evidenced by the 1% sequential growth in average balances. Importantly, the growth was diversified across most portfolios, including consumer direct, indirect auto and CRE. Within consumer the ongoing investments we have made in our digital and point of sale lending capabilities, which provide for a superior client experience are also driving good growth in enhancing our returns. Our auto portfolio continues to demonstrate healthy growth and solid risk-adjusted returns.","Within CRE, we continue to see growth tied to the investments we have made in permanent lending and bridge lending capabilities for institutional borrowers, which is being partially offset by run-off in the construction portfolio. Across both Wholesale and Consumer our underwriting discipline has not changed and we remain highly focused on ensuring that the quality of our new production is consistent with the quality of our existing portfolio.","On the deposit side, average balances were up 2% sequentially. The increased growth is reflective of strong production from our Consumer segment, where we are benefiting from increased momentum associated with new checking and savings products, which were introduced at the end of 2018 along with targeted marketing and pricing strategies. We also benefited from targeted growth was with certain corporate clients, as a result of success delivered by our corporate liquidity product specialists team.","Interest-bearing deposit costs increased by 4 basis points sequentially lower than the prior two quarter increases of 6 basis points and 9 basis points respectively. This quarter's increase in deposit costs reflects to some extent the lag impact from prior rate hikes and our desire to balance our funding profile. As I said earlier, we do anticipate deposit cost to begin to decline in the fourth quarter, but we will also be thoughtful about remaining competitive given our desire to maximize our ability to retain and grow clients as we embark on the merger and integration processes that are coming in couple of years.","Moving to Slide 10, which provides an update on our capital position. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.3% and the Tier 1 ratio was 10.4%, slightly higher than the prior quarter given the suspension of share repurchases. Book value and tangible book value per share increased by 3% sequentially given growth in retained earnings and the impact that lower rates had on improving the unrealized loss position in our securities and derivatives portfolio. We continue to expect capital ratios to trend upward, given the suspension of share repurchases and anticipation of our merger with BB&T. Separately, we increased our quarterly dividend by 12% this quarter to $0.56 per common share providing for an attractive dividend yield of 3.3%.","Moving to the segment overviews, we'll begin with the Consumer segment on Slide 11. The positive lending momentum we had in Consumer continued in the third quarter, with consumer lending production, excluding mortgage up 7% year-over-year. The investments we've made in LightStream and our point-of-sale lending partnerships, continue to be consistent contributors to our loan growth. Over the past year, we have focused on enhancing our analytics, improving automation, adding product offerings and growing our partnerships and referrals, all of which are key contributors to the 38% year-over-year growth we delivered in LightStream.","We've also made good progress in enhancing our point-of-sale lending capabilities and expanding our partnership networks. Relatedly, we added two additional point-of-sale financing partners this quarter. One focused on solar and the other focused on equipment. These partnerships further our strategy of investing in digital lending channels, which meet clients where they make purchase decisions. Consistent with prior quarters some of this collective growth has been offset by the continued decline in home equity.","On the deposit side, as I mentioned earlier, we're experiencing good momentum with the new product offerings, which were introduced at the end of 2018 . These products, combined with effective targeted marketing campaign have led to a strong year-over-year increase in new deposit production. Overall, the 7% loan growth and 2% deposit growth offset margin compression and drove a 1% increase in net interest income relative to the prior year.","Consumer fee income benefited from strength in mortgage production income as a result of an increase in refinancing activity and improved gain on sale margins. Mortgage income also benefited from increased adoption of SmartGUIDE, our digital mortgage application, which has surpassed 90%. This application, which provides for a significantly better user experience and streamlined aspect of the intake and underwriting process, combined with an improving back end process, made our mortgage team very well positioned to help our clients in the recent refinanced wave.","When looking at longer-term trends, our Consumer business has made significant strides over the last couple of years. Revenues up 8% driven by strong balance sheet growth and strength in mortgage and wealth-related fee. Assets under management are up by 10% in part due to better partnership across the Retail Premier and Wealth segments. We've made significant strides in improving our front-end client experience through ongoing enhancements to mobile and online banking, digital lending through SmartGUIDE, LightStream and point-of-sale partnerships. Our enterprise client portal for private wealth clients has provided for a differentiated experience for our high net worth client. It is now being leveraged for our new portal for small business clients. Our investments in our new account center have significantly improved the digital account opening experience and now, over 90% of our consumer products and solutions can be on-boarded and service 100% digitally. In addition to digital progress, our brands client experience scores are the strongest, they've been in years.","And finally, our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio in Consumer has improved by approximately 480 basis points, driven in part by 10% reduction in branch count, which is largely tied to increased digital adoption, improved productivity and strong revenue growth. All of this was accomplished in the context of consistent underwriting discipline and improved risk adjusted return. This progress combined with our strong presence across high growth markets in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic will be amplified, when we merge with BB&T, creating retail and private wealth businesses that will be amongst the leaders in the industry across many key dimensions, growth, efficiency talent and technology.","Moving to Wholesale on Slide 12, where our consistent strategy continues to drive good results. Loan growth disposed [ph] somewhat in the third quarter, largely as a result of increased pay downs within C&I and our own internal discipline around pricing and structure. Deposit growth picked up meaningfully as a result of success from our corporate liquidity product specialists team in addition to several -- several larger temporary client deposits. Investment banking income had strong performance across most of categories despite market volatility, with particular strength in debt capital markets and M&A. Relatedly, approximately 30% of our M&A fees year-to-date have come from commercial banking clients, a good indicator of the continued success we are having and bringing enhanced advisory capabilities to a broader set of clients and wholesale.","This underlying strength was largely masked by the aforementioned negative $14 million adjustment in trading income, in addition to a sequential decline in CRE related fee, given the especially strong performance in the second quarter. We're looking at broader trends commercial real estate related fees year-to-date are up 61%, reflective of our strong client relationships and deep expertise in the structured real estate business, the improved momentum from our agency lending business given increased partnership between our coverage bankers and product specialists, and good core performance from SunTrust Community Capital.","Similar to Consumer, when looking at longer-term trends our Wholesale business has made significant strides over the last three years. Revenue has grown at a 5% CAGAR with several key drivers including lead relationships have grown at a 10% CAGAR, driving increased market share with our clients. Revenue from non-CIB clients has grown at a 20% CAGAR over the last two years and now represents roughly 20% of capital markets fees. And commercial real estate related fees have seen strong growth, largely driven by the investments we have made in our agency lending capabilities through the acquisition of Pillar in 2016.","We expanded our commercial banking business into Ohio and Texas and we launched the national expansion of our aging services vertical within Commercial Banking. We've improved technology capabilities for clients and teammates, both for loan origination and our client facing treasury and payments portal [ph]. Each of these investments in growth was self-funded by ongoing efficiency initiatives, specifically our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio in Wholesale has improved by 225 basis points.","And importantly, these achievements were all accomplished in the context of consistent risk discipline and our ability to win, based on advice, not structure or pricing. Each of these strategies continues to drive solid, sustainable results and has created a strong foundation, which we can build upon as we merge with BB&T and have the opportunity to bring our capabilities and our differentiated model to a broader set of corporate and commercial clients.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Allison. The overall momentum we have on a standalone basis continues to validate my view that SunTrust is approaching the proposed merger with BB&T from a great position of strength. Individually, we are two very strong companies and together, we're going to be able to accomplish so much more together than either of us could have alone. So that is a context. Let me provide a progress update on the merger on Slide 13.","The combined executive management team has been meeting weekly for nearly nine months now. Over this period of time, I mean I think our teams have developed great rapport, trust and respect for one -- each other. This has exceeded my already very, very high expectations. As a team, we continue to work incredibly hard to lay the foundation for Truist and as we do so, there is a great sense of excitement for the future. Kelly, thanks for your collaborative leadership and to the whole team, thank you for your hard work, the incredible integrity and openness during this process. Everybody's roaring [ph] for Truist, it's just so apparent.","We've all worked hard to share this excitement with all of our teammates both at BB&T and SunTrust. We've had over 30 formal sets of communication regarding merger updates. They have included organizational design, technology ecosystem decisions, benefits packages and so much more. But those are just the formal sets of communications, we've had multiple more informal town halls listening sessions every former communication possible. Overall, I'm really proud of the transparency in this process. In the third quarter specifically we accomplish several key milestones.","On July 24th, Kelly and I appeared before the House Financial Services Committee and felt that the merits of this transaction were generally well received and understood by representatives. It was a real honor to represent all the things that SunTrust has done to benefits its clients and communities and it's heartening to hear back from representatives, community groups and clients on how many feel so positively about SunTrust and also by BB&T.","On July 30th, both SunTrust and BB&T shareholders overwhelmingly approved the transaction in connection with our special shareholders meeting. Throughout the quarter, our leaders continue their organizational design process, which culminated in the announcement of nearly 8,000 positions to date, consistent with the earlier phases of organization design, these leaders reflect great talent in both companies. It's a tremendous balance between both BB&T and SunTrust, great levels of diversity by both traditional definitions, but also by backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. We just simply have a superior team.","We've been making thoughtful decisions around compensation and benefits for Truist's teammates. When looking at the combined set of salary benefits, time off, retirement, volunteerism, career development resources, combined with the just incredible opportunities are going to be available for Truist teammates, I just fundamentally believe Truist will be the premier financial institution to work for in the country. We also made tremendous progress in selecting, which systems we'll use for Truist and creating roadmaps for integration. We identified approximately 100 ecosystems as part of this process and feel confident that the selections we've made and are making are going to create a super foundation for Truist by leveraging the best of both, architecting for the future and minimizing integration risk and providing additional security.","Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we conducted a legal day one readiness exercise with each of our approximately 100 merger work streams in the second half of September, and the results confirmed our confidence that we're in position to move very quickly after receiving regulatory approval. From here, we'll continue to work closely with regulators to answer their questions and finalize various process. The dialog has been extremely constructive and given all that we know today, we're targeting a close at some point in the fourth quarter. Once we do close, we're in a position to hit the ground running and we have several key milestones, which we plan to accomplish in our first 100 days as Truist.","First, as you can to imagine we'll present to the new Truist Board, all the proposed committee governance structures for approval legal day one. Our combined Board just like our combined management team brings a unique and diverse set of backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and skills and also excited to work with all of them. We will also engage with all of our teammates on Truist's purpose, mission and values, which is just so critical to helping build our new culture. I think as all of you know SunTrust and BB&T are both entering into this merger as companies that have strong purpose and mission foundations upon which to build. I will say from a personal perspective, this work has really been rewarding and the approach that everyone has taken to build a truly purpose-oriented company is very exciting to think about. We'll continue to refine all aspects of the Truist brand with the goal of rolling this out in 2020. As you know, we'll still go to market as BB&T and SunTrust as divisions of Truist for some period of time as we get through the client conversion process.","And finally, we'll begin executing against the opportunities we've identified to harness expense and revenue synergies. With great energy from our teams and the help of third parties there has been a significant amount of time dedicated to creating clear playbook for achieving our cost saves. Some of the near-term opportunities, there'll be initial savings from removing duplicative positions across the Company, most of which have been identified as part of our organizational design process, third party spend will be a key area of focus and scenarios where we both use the same vendor partner will have the opportunity to negotiate better contracts and quickly rationalized costs and scenarios where we use different vendor partners will swiftly begin an RFP process and work through a thoughtful selection process.","And finally, we'll continue to refine our plans to rationalize our real estate footprint. Branch closures will not begin until after the first year, but there'll be opportunity in the next six to nine months to harness savings from our non-branch corporate real estate footprint. And while it may take a little longer for revenue synergies to come to fruition, we're going to quickly start executing against the opportunities we have to bring a more fulsome set of products and capabilities to an expanded client base. You know, that sort of a traditional way of explaining revenue synergies, but I see another important layer, which is the leverage we create by recognizing each other's executional prowess and go-to-market strategies. Our teams are choosing the best of both to define Truist go-to-market strategy, which I think will be incredibly effective.","I feel very confident in our future and I'm proud of all the work that's been done to get us to where we are today. When we announced our name Truist, we also declared that Truist would stand for better -- better experiences, better partnerships, better technology and creating a better future for our teammates, our clients and our communities. Because of the team we have in place, the capabilities that each Company brings and the identified synergy opportunities we have from leveraging each Company's executional excellence, I can already declare that Truist will be better with the objective of being the absolute self.","So before I conclude, I want to thank all of the SunTrust teammates and BB&T associates who are just working incredibly hard to make this merger a success, whether it's directly an integration planning, managing risk, investing in our communities or most importantly doing that job they do every day, providing outstanding confidence and service to our clients. I want you all know that your efforts are a significant part of making history.","So with that Ankur, let me turn the call back over to you.","Ankur Vyas","Great. Tony, we are now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. So you can start that process.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right, sir. Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions].","Bill Rogers","While we're waiting, this is Bill; let me assure you that Allison and I are very excited about taking your questions, but I cannot speak for why AT&T had any hesitation but we're very excited and glad to be back on.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first quarter from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning. So I just wanted to say thanks for getting back on for the Q&A. I guess a couple of questions; first off, I wanted to understand your -- what you're hearing from the corporate clients that you have, I mean, [indiscernible] obviously is a big piece of your business. I know that you mentioned that you're going to be both, going with the SunTrust brand still for a while here until you migrate -- maybe if you could give us a sense as to; A) How long do you think that's going to be for corporate clients? And then, also give us a sense as to -- we got some feedback here.","Bill Rogers","We can hear you fine.","Betsy Graseck","How you are thinking -- yes, how you're thinking about -- you know, your go-to-market strategy to the corporate clients just generally?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think a couple of things. If I went and sort of did a consumer, commercial and large corporate and how everybody is feeling, I think as many have articulated and we feel the same way; the consumers are really strong, and good credit quality, good spending, good confidence sentiment and that obviously drives what happens in commercial and the corporate side. On the commercial side, I would say they are cautiously optimistic; I've been with lot of clients recently and a lot of more coming off sort of record years and record quarters which I think would cause them to be a little naturally cautious. Most of the challenges mentioned out [ph] I think are in the hiring and retaining of employees; they are sort of managing through the tariff issues that sort of a small percent of their business. On the large corporate side, clearly more impact on global slowdown, picture category, ISM numbers. But we've also seen really good strong earning season, we've seen some positive developments and maybe even today and certainly in last few days. And I would say they are cautious, but resilient; and I think the resilience thing is probably the important part. My sense is in talking to clients is, they have an ability more so today than ever just sort of react quickly; so I think the data's attached to different news cycles and different news events are sort of high, but they can slice -- they can slice both ways.","Our go-to-market strategy is really, I think it's one of the hallmarks of what those Truist merger is going -- going to look like. Because we're really combining the best of -- best of both worlds. If we take -- start with our commercial community banking model, we're doing all the great things that BB&T does in execution, deposit generation, small business, relationship management, technology and combining that with all the specialties of aging services not for profit, all the capital markets penetration, so the ability to go to market and take the best of what both companies have to offer, I think is going to be the real hallmark of what -- of what Truist has. As it relates to sort of the large corporate go-to-market, we're really consolidating what happens with BB&T and what happens at SunTrust. There are great opportunities in both places to create some capacity and some products and capabilities that we didn't have, either one and accentuate those and run those through the model that I think is running effectively and efficiently today.","Betsy Graseck","And do you go with the Truist brand sooner on the corporate side, than the consumer side or is do you have a sense as to the time frame for when we should expect that branding switch to happen on the corporate side?","Bill Rogers","Yes, that's a great question and that's one of the things that we'll be evaluating. Day one, that will be day one, but that's one of the things that we'll be evaluating sort of what leads and what lags in terms of -- in terms of the brand. But in how we go to market, I mean, it will be more Truist feeling, because it will be -- all those decisions have been made, all those alignments have happened. What we did, specifically with the branding will talk more about it as we enter the first part of next year.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And so when you're talking about the go-to market too, you're talking about the pricing and structure and aligning on, coverage model, has that already been decided or is there maybe what you get to post close.","Bill Rogers","Yes, all that work has been done, which has been great. I mean that's what the teams have been really cranking away for the last nine months. Literally, as the starting gun is to be able to go to the market really effectively, people know what their jobs are, they know who their bosses are, they know what their capabilities are and hit the ground running.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me?","Bill Rogers","Hi Mike.","Allison Dukes","We can hear you.","Mike Mayo","So we've all seen the statistic that -- something like two out of three mergers do not work out and what you're saying is our -- it is working out well for you so far. So, one is can you simply define and describe the culture on day one to [indiscernible] once the merger closes and in simple terms if possible? And the other part of this is, I mean I hear you and Kelly, it sounds like everything is going great. And it's the respect and then you've had no -- it sounds like a newlyweds right, and we all know that newlyweds eventually will have some issues or questions or disagreement. So can you just bring up one example of a disagreement that you had and how it's been resolved? Because we know that's inevitable and it just sounds a little bit too good to be true on the outside or maybe I'm just missing something? Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Well, I think the last part of your question is undisputable and cynical, and that's what your job is, and I appreciate and I respect that. I think culture isn't a day one event. So when you say what's the culture like day one, I don't actually think about the world that way, I mean culture is something that's defined over time, it's built together. So, the things that -- things that will exist day one, and I think this is really critical as -- our two companies are, I think arguably deepest and deeply ingrained in purpose, mission and values, and these are not marketing slogans, they're not initiatives, they're not what we're going to pay. This is how we live. This is how we drive our companies. Our employees think about the why, as much as they do about the how. And that came up in the survey work we've done. I mean we're working with the outside consultants, I mean on the cultural work, look we've really never seen two companies that are disembedded in terms of -- in terms of how they think about purpose.","So if we think about what their day one, it's going to be that. I mean that's going to be there, that was there and that will continue to be a framework. We have done an incredible amount of work, as I talked about in aligning those two and aligning the words. The teamwork on that has been spectacular and the alignment has been spectacular, which sort of defines, I think those cultural moments when you get together and talk about hard issues, are you doing it in a way that's looking forward and are you doing it in a way that puts -- that puts everything on the table.","I know you're driving for how Kelly and I disagreed and what are all these issues and where we squabbling, and the fact is, it's just not happening. I mean we have a strong alignment. We came into this merger with a clear vision of what we wanted to accomplish. We came into this merger with the same strong sense of the why as just as important as to how. We came into this merger recognizing what the benefits were. And I would say the parts that have worked and the parts where we not disagreed is because everything has been in the middle of the table. We just haven't had an issue where you know, it's the BB&T way or it's the SunTrust way. We automatically put those in the middle and if we've had discussions versus disagreements, it's about ensuring that, that happens.","You, Kelly might say, let's make sure that's in the middle, I might say Kelly, let's make sure that's in the middle. We have sort of code words between us, which is no light between us. So if we see light between us or between our teams, we get on it immediately. I've got a long list of texts from Kelly, Kelly has got a long list from me and we focus on closing -- closing those issues. So you know, but they're also, Mike, the differences. I mean, let's be honest about that. The differences and what's -- we celebrate those. I mean that's diversity of thought, I can tell you, I'm a better leader for having spent nine months working with the BB&T leadership, I've learned a lot and it will make me a -- it will make me a better leader going forward and I would trust that, they would say the same thing on the other side. So having a little bit of diversity and a little bit of difference of thought is a good thing, it's not a bad thing.","Mike Mayo","And then I guess one more time, one short follow-up. When I got married, I wanted to live in a one-bedroom condo and my wife wanted to live in a studio loft. So we compromised and we lived in the studio loft, that was an attempt at a joke. But when you do have that complex, because it's going to have been probably in bigger ways that you've seen already. What are your plans for resolving that, just walk us through that?","Bill Rogers","Well, we have a -- first of all, we have a very collaborative model and Kelly and I both lead from a collaborative basis. So I think that's a strong -- a strong suit and that actually showed up on the survey, the work that we did -- that's, it's not a topped down, it's not a one person decision making. So the first chain of events as it will go through that collaborative model and again we've spent nine months working on that. The buck does stop and the buck will stop with Kelly as CEO. So if it gets to a point where know there some disagreement, somebody has got to make a decision, that's Kelly's job. He embraces that job, I embrace him having it and we're working together. I mean, sort of, what I would consider to be normal business practices.","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in queue will come from John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi, good morning. Bill, I wanted to ask you about the $1.6 billion net merger cost synergy. I think both companies have expressed incremental confidence in that. Now that you've done some preparatory work, maybe even some greater confidence in that. So I wanted to just ask you again, recognizing you guys are moving slowly with the integration to do it right. What's the timeline for achieving those merger saves? As you think about, how should we reasonably think about the timeline there? And if there is upside, how will you and Kelly, you think about reinvesting that in marketing or technology? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think couple of things John, I mean, as you can imagine, we did the $1.6 billion on February 7th. So a couple of things. We remain confident in the $1.6 billion. I think every time we peel back the onion, we remain more confident, but the elements of that are changing. It might be a certain more percent of something that we thought or certain less percent of something that we thought. So, the elements of the $1.6 billion are changing as we've been developing our plan and as we dig deeper into each situation, but the positives are offsetting the negatives in terms of change. So that creates our confidence. I think we'll talk a lot more about timing, sort of, after closing. I think that will be -- I think that will be the time to really sit down and be more definitive about putting that $1.6 billion over a more specific timeline. We did that at the outset and now we're -- we'll know a lot more -- we'll have a lot more details and work together. But I think the element of being confident about the $1.6 billion is what's important. We'll get through the specific timing of how that happens as we learn more and think about ecosystems and risk and all those things that we want to make sure that we mitigate.","And then as it relates to how do we invest, I mean the good news is, there is an insatiable appetite to invest. So our teams are also spending time trying to prioritize the things that we want to invest from an incremental basis. Remember the $1.6 billion already included some incremental investments. So there are things that are sort of already in the queue and underway and I think we've got a really good process and system to add things in the queue in terms of incremental investment. And those will be both short term and long term.","John McDonald","Okay. And then I wanted to bring it back to the quarter for Allison. The outlook for fourth quarter Allison on the net interest margin down 2 to 5. Could you give us an idea of what kind of assumptions you have in there for Fed cuts, yield curve and deposit betas?","Allison Dukes","Sure. Thanks, John. So the guidance of down 2 to 5 assumes that when we only have rate cut in September. And the real variability underlying that range is around deposit betas. So if we were to not have a zero beta and not effectively have any improvement in our deposit pricing, then that decline would be probably closer to 5 basis points. 25% beta would be closer to down 2 basis points. If we were to get another rate cut in October, then there is probably an additional 3 to 4 basis points of pressure on our net interest margin.","John McDonald","Okay, great. And then one more Allison for you. Could you talk broadly about CECL, like what would day one look like for SunTrust, if you were a stand-alone? And then maybe some comment about the nuances of how CECL accounting interacts with merger accounting, I know it's very complicated, but any thoughts there would be really helpful? Thanks.","Allison Dukes","Yes, we're not going to give guidance as to what the impact of CECL would be for SunTrust on a stand-alone basis, simply because we don't expect to be on a standalone basis, as we move into 2020 with an expectation that we can still close the merger in the fourth quarter. I will tell you, we've been in parallel run for a couple of quarters. We are ready for implementation in January. It's been going very well, but we're going to need to work through the impact of the merger. There is a lot of work to be done between our teams to make sure that our economic scenario assumptions, among other things have some consistency and so that guidance will be given by Truist after closing and that's really going to be the most relevant guidances, the guidance that's given for Truist as a whole. None of it will impact the strategic merits of the merger overall, but clearly there is a lot of work to be done by both teams to make sure we're giving you good guidance as we move into a post-closing environment.","John McDonald","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question that will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks. Good morning, a couple of more things, just on the results. Can you just give us a sense of just how this quarter's fee strength do you feel -- how do you feel about the continuity of that going forward, any changes in pipelines and origination? Is it both, when I think about more investment banking and mortgage most specifically as the two that have shown better strength of late?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I'll try to add a couple of those Ken. On the mortgage side, obviously you have some seasonality. So fourth quarter tends to be lower than the third quarter, but we've also had a really good refinance activity. So that's -- that will have some overlay to that -- to that seasonality on the positive side. On the CRE side, I mean we'll have a good fourth quarter. It won't be what it was last fourth quarter, but we've had some of that in the earlier quarters of this year, but it will be --- 2019 will be up over 2018 and some of those things are episodic, but I think we'll be strong in the fourth quarter.","We've had really good asset flows in Private Wealth Management is Allison talked about. So I think we'll continue to be on a positive front in that. And then capital markets, we've got -- we have good momentum. We've got incredible diversity. I would say the pipelines are good, but they're probably shorter in terms of thinking about it, just because markets are a little bit choppier. I would expect the second half to be better than the first half, but it's become a little bit more of a month-to-month kind of view than a quarter-to-quarter view. But the diversity of what we are doing, the pipelines, the strategies and all those things I feel really good about.","Ken Usdin","Got it. And a bigger picture question about that investment banking point, Bill, I mean obviously, the deal hasn't closed yet, but both sets of bankers know about the potential synergies of the product sets at least from a SunTrust side. How is that conversation changed at all, with the way people are approaching, using the bank or prospectively thinking about -- being able to do more with the bank? Any -- just anecdotes or story lines about from the customer base to date?","Bill Rogers","Yes, look, I think we've got to be careful, right. So we're not talking to clients specifically about individual activities, because we're still in a competitive mode. But clients, I'm sure have come to use and really are recognizing the fact that we've got additional capabilities and additional benefits and they're starting to ask the questions. We sort of have to keep on the bay a little bit at this particular juncture, but I think that capacity to hit the ground running and be able to have a really receptive audience.","I've said this before, I mean clients really want an alternative to a lot of the bulge bracket firms and we provide a great alternative. We provide great diversity to their base. We have a lot of specialties. We have this access to our commercial base and they see that access multiplying by probably 3x in terms of the number of our commercial clients and the BB&T portfolio. So I think all the strategies that we put in place are really going to just be accentuated and accelerated with this merger and our clients are recognizing that. But today we're competing. And we're going to stay in that mode until legal day one, and then we're going to shift really, really quickly and based on those conversations that even I've had personally, the client receptivity, I think is going to be really strong.","Ken Usdin","Got it.","Allison Dukes","The only thing I'd add to that is, client certainly recognize that our capability on the investment banking side will remain and increase to some extent. But I think even more than that, they recognize that our balance sheet will double in size. And so if they ever had any concern about our size and our ability to support them as they grow, I think the merger alleviate that concern and give them a lot of confidence that Truist will be the bank that can offer them the full breadth of capabilities that they continue to grow as well.","Ken Usdin","Okay, thanks, Allison. And just one last one, just -- there was a little bit of a bounce in the C&I, NPLs, but the charge-off ratio remained very low. Just -- you mentioned that credit is still very stable underneath, just any color or context to whether that's just seasoning or blips coming through, that would be great? Thank you.","Bill Rogers","Yes, I don't see anything that's a trend in there. I mean we're bouncing along the bottom. So I think in any one quarter now, we're going to see NPL go up or go down by some -- by some marginal amount, but as you can imagine, we're knee-deep and stressing everything in our portfolios and looking at all the opportunities for change. And there is nothing that I see this quarter, that looks like a trend. I think it's just a couple of idiosyncratic things and again quarter-to-quarter I think when you're low on the bottom, you're just going to see that.","Ken Usdin","Got it, thanks very much.","Bill Rogers","Thank you, everyone for joining. It looks like there are no more questions in the queue and therefore, this concludes our call. If you have any further questions please feel free to contact the IR team.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead, sir.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Julia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to SunTrust Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, let me turn the call over to Bill.","William Rogers","Great. Thanks, Ankur, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the second quarter, which we highlight on Slide 3. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.49, which represents a 16% increase compared to the prior quarter and a 45% increase compared to the prior year.","Overall, we had a strong quarter. This performance is driven by our focus on continuous improvement and consistent investments in growth, in addition to the favorable operating environment.","On the revenue front, we saw a pickup in both capital markets revenues and commercial lending activity as was anticipated by the pipelines we had leading into the quarter. These improvements, when combined with a 4 basis point expansion in our net interest margin, resulted in a 4% sequential revenue growth.","Bigger picture, this growth is the direct result of the ongoing investments we have made and continue to make in our key areas of differentiation, including SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, the broader wholesale banking segment, and our consumer lending business.","In addition to the revenue growth we delivered, our continued discipline on both expenses and returns is driving improvement in our profitability and, ultimately, enhancing the earnings power of the company.","Specifically, this quarter, our tangible efficiency ratio was 58.7%, and for the first half of the year, it was 60.4%, down 220 basis points relative to the first half of last year. Given our strong performance this year, I'm confident in our ability to reach our sub-60% target somewhat sooner than we originally anticipated.","More importantly, I can certainly see a path for several hundred basis points of additional improvement beyond sub-60% over the medium term. However, improvement in efficiency ratio will not be our only measurement of success.","I believe across the company, we have significant opportunities to grow our client base and improve the client experience, and we will ensure that we have the agility and flexibility to invest in those opportunities as well.","Separately, credit quality continues to be a strength for us, not only because of the favorable operating environment, but also because our risk culture and discipline that's instilled across the company. This quarter, our consistently low charge-off ratio and improved outlook for credit losses across the portfolio, including potential hurricane losses, drove a 5 basis point decline in our ALLL ratio.","Our credit quality is also validated by our results in our most recent CCAR process, where our loan losses in the severely adverse scenario continue to be among the lowest relative to peers.","Given this performance, the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2018 capital plan, which calls for a 52% increase in share repurchases and a 25% increase in the dividend, thereby keeping us on track to increase capital returns for the seventh consecutive year.","This is a direct result of our consistent performance in CCAR, our strong capital position and the significant progress we've made in improving our core earnings power.","The quarter had good success on multiple fronts, revenue growth, efficiency, credit quality and capital returns, all of which have a compounding effect for our owners, evidenced by the 17.7% return on tangible common equity.","So with that as a quick overview, let me turn it over to Allison.","Alison Dukes","Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Moving to Slide 4. As Bill indicated, our net interest margin improved 4 basis points this quarter, primarily as a result of the increase in short-term rates following the March rate hike.","We also benefited from positive mix shift within the loan portfolio as consumer direct continues to grow faster than the rest of the book. These benefits were partially offset by higher deposit costs and higher levels of wholesale funding, given the pickup in loan growth. This improvement in the net interest margin, when combined with the 1% growth in average loan, resulted in a 3% sequential increase in net interest income.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect the net interest margin to increase by 0 to 2 basis points relative to the second quarter. Largely as a result of the June rate hike and inclusive of our expectations, the deposit cost will continue to increase.","More broadly, the pace of NIM expansion going forward is likely to be lower than what we have experienced in the recent past due to rising interest rates and higher loan-to-deposit ratios, both of which will negatively impact funding costs.","However, this environment is also likely correlated to solid loan growth, which will support continued growth in net interest income.","Moving to Slide 5. Non-interest income increased by $33 million sequentially, driven entirely by strength in capital markets, which was up $47 million relative to the first quarter.","This was due to broad-based growth across most investment banking and trading businesses. Some of this increase was offset by lower mortgage servicing income, which declined by $14 million as a result of higher decay expense, most of which was driven by higher prepaid fees in connection with the spring and summer purchase season.","Additionally, other non-interest income included a $12 million gain related to our investment in GreenSky of approximately 1 million shares. This is $11 million lower than the $23 million gain we recorded in the first quarter related to a separate fintech investment.","As you can see on Slide 6, the solid expense discipline we've been delivering continued into the second quarter. Expenses were down by $27 million sequentially, with most of the decline driven by the seasonal trends in employee compensation and benefit cost in addition to a $13 million gain related to the sale of former branch properties, which was recorded in other non-interest expense.","Some of this was offset by higher outside processing and software expense as a result of ongoing investment in data and technology, in addition to higher operating losses, which benefited from a $10 million legal accrual reversal in the first quarter.","Compared to the prior year, expenses were stable, even after the 3% revenue growth. This is a reflection of our ongoing efficiency efforts and higher branch closure costs in the second quarter of last year.","Separately, now that we are two quarters into the year and have a better understanding of the impact of the new tax laws -- that the new tax laws have on our company, we're slightly revising our tax rate guidance. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19% and between 20% and 21%, if you model us on a fully taxable equivalent basis.","As you can see on Slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 58.7%, which represents solid improvement relative to the prior quarter and prior year. As Bill mentioned, we will achieve our full year sub-60% target somewhat sooner than we originally anticipated, but we aren't focused on the exact quarter in which we achieve this goal.","Rather we are much more focused on continuing to create capacity to invest in technology and talent to meet more client needs, which we believe will create the most long-term value for our clients and our shareholders.","Moving now to Slide 8. Our net charge-off ratio decreased by 2 basis points sequentially. The low level of net charge-offs reflects the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I and CRE portfolios, performance we are extremely pleased with, but we remain cognizant that there could be both variability and normalization going forward.","The ALLL ratio declined by 5 basis points sequentially as a result of our improved outlook for hurricane-related losses. This decline, when combined with the low charge-offs, resulted in a very low provision expense of $32 million.","While our net charge-off ratio has come in below expectation for the last few quarters, we still expect to operate with a 25 to 35 basis point net charge-off ratio for the rest of the year as C&I and CRE charge-offs have been de minimis in the recent past. In addition, if the current asset quality conditions sustain, then the ALLL ratio could decline modestly.","Now moving to the balance sheet on Slide 9. As Bill mentioned, lending trends improved this quarter, with average loans up 1% and period-end loans up 2% sequentially.","The growth was broad-based across C&I, CRE and consumer lending. Looking ahead, we've got good momentum across both commercial and consumer lending, and our pipeline supports this.","On the deposit side, average balances were stable sequentially and year-over-year. As anticipated, we continue to see a migration from lower cost deposits to CDs in part due to our targeted offers, and we would expect this migration to continue as interest rates rise. Separately, within our wholesale business, we also had several depositors use cash for acquisitions and business investment, a good sign of client confidence.","Relatively, deposit costs increased given both the continued increases in rates, the migration towards higher cost deposits and the pickup in lending activity. We expect betas to continue to trend upwards, but the trajectory will be influenced by the absolute level of rates in addition to the lending environment.","We remain focused on maximizing the value proposition for our clients outside of rate paid, and that's improving our deposit growth trajectory in a responsible fashion. However, if deposit growth remains slow, our access to alternative funding sources is strong.","Moving to Slide 10, which provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2018 CCAR process, and our relative performance within the CCAR bank group continues to be strong, further validation of the quality and diversity of our loan portfolio.","Our improved planning, analytics and risk profile allowed us to maximize the level of capital returns in this year's CCAR cycle while still meeting the minimum required stressed capital levels. The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $2 billion over the coming four quarters.","Also, subject to board approval, we will increase our annual common stock dividend from $1.60 to a full $2 per share, representing an attractive 3% dividend yield for investors in SunTrust.","In addition, this represents a 39% increase in capital returns relative to our previous plan, a meaningful benefit for our owners. Our estimated Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.7%, and the Tier 1 ratio was 10.9%. Both are down slightly relative to the prior quarter due to growth in risk-weighted assets.","Our capital plan does contemplate a preferred issuance as we work towards optimizing our capital ratios. However, the timing of that issuance will be dependent upon asset growth and our views on the interest rate environment.","Moving to the segment overviews. We'll begin with the Consumer segment on Slide 11, where we continue to have solid momentum. One of our primary strategic priorities has been to improve our balance sheet diversity and enhance returns.","Thus far, we feel good about the results we've delivered, the investments we've made across consumer lending, especially in LightStream, our third-party partnerships and credit card are driving solid growth and improvements in our risk-adjusted returns.","Our momentum in LightStream, in particular, is improving, given the work we've done to enhance our analytics, new product offerings and growth in partnerships and referrals. We also added an additional third-party lending partner in the second quarter, a reflection of our strong digital and partnership capabilities.","Some of this collective growth has been offset by the continued declines in home equity and our intentional pullback from certain lower-return portfolios, like auto.","While we're seeing strong growth in net interest income and Consumer, mortgage-related income has been pressured, particularly when looking at year-over-year trends. On the production side, this is driven by lower volumes and lower gain on sale margins.","On the servicing side, MSR decay expense has been rising due to the fact that the MSR asset has significantly increased in value over the past few quarters as a result of the increase in rates, and thus incoming cash flow creates a larger level of decay expense, all things being equal.","Our wealth management business, however, is demonstrating positive underlying trends, with AUM up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, a reflection that our value proposition for our targeted client segments is resonating in the marketplace, driving growth in new clients and greater wallet share with existing clients.","In addition to the solid revenue growth in Consumer, the actions we've taken to improve efficiency drove an 11% year-over-year improvement in PPNR and a 200 basis point improvement in our tangible efficiency ratio.","Our branch count is down by 5% in the past year, which is largely enabled by our increasing digital adoption rate. We're also making significant strides in leveraging technology to enhance our agility and efficiency.","As an example, since we introduced our new cloud-based digital mortgage application, called SmartGUIDE, in March, we've added several new capabilities and enhancements, including a seamless integration with Salesforce to pre-fill existing client information, and we're constantly working to refine and improve the client experience.","Thus far, the feedback from our clients has been very positive, and this new digital application already accounts for approximately 45% of our total applications, surpassing our internal expectations. This is just one example of the work that's being done to not only improve efficiency, but also to enhance the client experience.","Bigger picture, we're just over a year into our journey of creating a more integrated consumer business, and we're very pleased with the initial results. We've made good strides in appropriately wiring the ecosystem, so we're delivering the right solution at the right time.","This not only enhances the client experience, it also generates operational efficiencies. We still have more work to do, but we've got a great team in place. We have a very clear strategy, and we're in some of the highest growth markets in the country.","Moving to Wholesale Banking on Slide 12, where we had another good quarter in part due to strong capital market conditions, but also reflective of the continued strategic momentum we have with our clients. On the lending side, we saw solid growth across CIB, commercial and CRE.","Our growth in CRE, in particular, is a reflection of the investments we've made to meet more clients' needs. Specifically, at the end of 2017, we added permanent financing and bridge loan capability to our platform, the latter of which was developed to support our agency lending business, which we acquired at the end of 2016.","The growth in these two products is more than offsetting the run-off in our construction portfolio and giving us the capability to support our CRE clients through the full life cycle of a project, not just the construction phase.","More broadly, the growth in our wholesale lending portfolio is a reflection of our clients' increased optimism, which has driven more M&A activity and incremental investments.","Within capital markets, we had another strong quarter, with broad-based growth across most products, including debt capital markets, M&A, equity and derivatives, the latter of which reflect increased interest rate hedging activity amongst our clients.","Importantly, our breadth of reach continues to increase, reflected by the fact that year-to-date, capital markets fees from commercial banking, CRE and private wealth clients are up 30%.","We're still in the early innings of executing this strategy, but we are highly encouraged by the momentum and believe we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this space, given our full set of capabilities and our One Team approach. The partnership between our commercial bankers, investment bankers, product and industry specialists, and corporate finance team is a great reflection of our culture.","Like Consumer, wholesale is approving -- improving its efficiency levels while investing in the business. This quarter, specifically, we completed the transition to SunView, our new treasury management platform, and we're working on future enhancements to our cash and treasury management capabilities.","In connection with our strategy to expand the scope of our commercial banking business, we also announced the national expansion of our aging services vertical to better capture the significant opportunity we have to support this industry, given our capability set and demographic trends.","We're also delivering on our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being. We now have 120 corporate and commercial clients that have signed up for Momentum on up.","That's our program which aims to help companies equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success. It's been especially impactful in our expansion markets and has allowed us to have differentiated conversation, focused on how to help these prospective clients grow their business via a more engaged workforce, not just alone.","Our success thus far has also validated our belief that the combination of purpose, talent, technology and a One Team approach can overcome the legacy advantages, such as physical presence and brand.","And finally, we're benefiting from continued low charge-off levels, which are a reflection of the overall strength of the economy, in addition to our consistent underwriting discipline around credit, structure and diversity.","Big picture, while market conditions can and do create quarterly variability, pipelines are healthy, and we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we have in wholesale as we bring our differentiated business model to clients in new and existing markets.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Bill.","William Rogers","Great. Thanks, Allison. So to conclude, I'll point to Slide 13, which highlights how our performance this quarter aligns with our investment thesis. Overall, this was a well rounded quarter and one where our performance is the direct result of the strategies we've put in place and the investments we've made.","Much of our investment strategy has been to focus on growing and supporting our key areas of differentiation, which has proven to be highly effective and is reflected in this quarter's results.","So more specifically, the investments we've made in LightStream and third-party partnerships are providing top-notch experiences for our clients and attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.","Within CIB, we've been particularly focused on investing in our M&A and equity platforms to allow us to increasingly become the strategic adviser of choice. The advisory capabilities continue to grow at a faster pace than the traditional debt business, which, obviously, ultimately, improves our ROE.","Within commercial banking and the broader wholesale platform, we've invested heavily in developing our industry and corporate finance expertise such that we can deliver increasingly sophisticated solutions to all of our clients.","As Allison mentioned, we took another step in the geographic expansion of commercial banking by broadening the scope of our aging services vertical, an area where we already have demonstrated a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace.","More broadly, our focus on continuing to improve our technology infrastructure both for clients and teammates remains high. As discussed earlier, we saw good initial adoption of SmartGUIDE and completed the transition of all of our wholesale clients to SunView, our improved treasury management platform. In addition, we recently brought our mobile app in-house, which gives us the ability to add new features at a much faster pace.","To further improve our agility, we're increasing our pace to migrate many of our client-facing digital platforms to the public cloud. Lastly, we're also making significant strides in removing friction from our middle and back office infrastructure to enhance our teammates' experience and improve efficiency.","In addition to the strong revenue growth we delivered this quarter, it's important to recognize the significant progress we're making in improving the underlying financial performance of the company.","Our net interest margin is up by 14 basis points year-over-year. A large part that's attributed to the improving rate environment, but we've also benefited from our improved loan mix and a higher risk-adjusted returns.","Our tangible efficiency ratio improved by 190 basis points year-over-year as a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, in addition to our strong revenue growth.","Our tangible common equity was 17.7% this quarter. Some of this is clearly a reflection of a favorable operating environment, but it's also due to years of work on balance sheet optimization, improvements in efficiency and better asset quality. And ultimately, each of these components drove a 45% improvement in our bottom line results.","Lastly, the strength of our capital position, our improved analytics and risk profile and growing earnings power allowed us to maximize the opportunity to repatriate capital to our owners in the recent CCAR cycle.","Each owner not only gains incremental ownership in the company as a result of our 52% increase in share repurchases, they also benefit from a meaningful 25% increase in cash dividends, which keeps SunTrust with an above-average dividend payout ratio.","Owners and prospective investors in SunTrust will benefit from a $2 per share in dividends, along with growth opportunities created from the investments we have made in key businesses, our attractive footprint and our focus on making further improvements in returns and efficiency across the organization.","All of this collective progress is driven by our team. Across the company, I can sense a higher level of performance and engagement among teammates. It gives me great pride that our teammates take an active role in shaping our engaged, purpose-driven culture. So team, thank you.","In summary, we had a strong quarter. We have good momentum building into the second half of the year. Our businesses have compelling competitive advantages and strong markets in which they operate. All of this is underpinned by a purpose-driven culture that emphasizes a one team and client-first mentality.","So with that, let me turn it back over to Ankur, and we'll begin the Q&A portion.","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Julia, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John McDonald of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi. Good morning, guys Looked like you saw a nice pickup in loan growth this quarter. Bill, maybe you could give us a little bit of color in terms of what you saw there? Is it changes in production, you seeing better production or -- is also some better paydown? Maybe just a little bit of color there on both the commercial and consumer side? Thanks.","William Rogers","Yes, paydown has actually been fairly consistent. So this was a quarter in which we saw strong production. We talked about that sort of at the end of the first quarter and leading into the second quarter.","We've talked, John, about the advent of when will we sort of see some of this benefit from tax stimulus, sort of what's the gestation period, and I think we're starting to see some of that.","I mean, what was really encouraging is that it was very broad-based. It was more business investment and M&A, less refinance, so seems more sustainable. Consumer lending, continuing growth in the targeted areas, LightStream and the partnerships, credit card and all of those are accretive to our bottom line.","We did see the benefit of some new lending capabilities in CRE that we introduced last year. This was part of our broader strategy and really a lot in conjunction with our Pillar acquisition. We're doing some more permanent financing.","We're doing some agency bridge financing, all very conservatively underwritten as you would expect, but allows us to participate more in the full cycle with very, very strong partners.","And then we've also seen some construction loan activity in the Southeast, in particular. We've seen a lot of build to suit for regional and national headquarters, which I think is a good evidence of just the strength in our markets.","And then some revolver utilization improvement as well. So the answer is, it was -- a lot of places, it was broad-based, and it was accretive to what we saw, I mean, to our existing portfolios and the existing pipelines look good.","John McDonald","Great. And just a quick follow-up on the capital return. There's a nice step-up in the buybacks. Any expected cadence or timing around the buyback? Do you have any preset idea to front-load it or have it more evenly distributed? Any thoughts there?","Alison Dukes","Sure, John. This is Allison. We have more flexibility with our buybacks this year, but we haven't determined exactly how we're going to space that out yet.","John McDonald","Okay. Thanks, guys.","William Rogers","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","William Rogers","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","I was just wondering if you could talk about the ability to continue to take out costs and essentially self-fund. Obviously, your comments on the efficiency ratio in the medium term are very positive, but we are seeing some expense pressure at some of your peers, with some inflationary pressures. Could you just talk about the ability to continue to take out costs and keep the expense growth minimal?","William Rogers","Yes, we tend to focus on the efficiency ratio rather than the expense number. But as I've said in my comments, I mean, I think over the medium term, Matt, I still see several hundred basis points of efficiency improvement. We don't want to get locked down to a quarter-by-quarter definition of what that might be, but we still see opportunities to improve, and they're in virtually every category.","I mean, there are organizational issues. We've done a lot of things related to structure, span and layers. We did a voluntary retirement last year. We're down in roughly 4% total FTEs over the last 9 months. Lots of opportunities still in technology and the realization, quite frankly, of investments that we've already made. We've automated a lot of processes in the company.","Private wealth has been a really good leader in that area as an example; the new loan and mortgage platforms; cloud migration, which I mentioned; a lot of end-to-end back office opportunities; we consolidated from 10 to 2 sites in mortgage and, again, we'll realize the benefits of that; supplier relationships continue to grind on those opportunities and optimizing and more opportunities to pay for what you use; and then our real estate footprint.","Our branches are down 5% roughly year-over-year. Total combined real estate footprint is down 20% since 2011. We've done some major consolidations in some of our major markets, and we still have opportunities there.","So all of those things, Matt, are what give me the optimism that we can continue to drive the efficiency ratio down and, as you said, create the additional runway to invest, which we've been doing all along. I mean, this structure of the declining efficiency ratio has been combined with significant investments in our business.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","William Rogers","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore.","John Pancari","Morning.","William Rogers","Morning, John.","John Pancari","Also, on the efficiency ratio outlook, thanks for that color. Just in terms of the change in the guidance and the pull-forward or the expectation that you could hit that lower -- below 60% level sooner, how would you describe the main driver of that change? Is that more of where you're coming in on the revenue? Or would you say greater progress than you initially anticipated on the expense side in the Consumer and corporate business?","William Rogers","Yes, I'd say it's both. I mean, it's a good combination of both. The environment from a revenue standpoint is increasingly better and then all -- just realizing all the things we've done from an efficiency standpoint on the expense side and then conscious of the things that we're continuing to do. So remember, we've set the sub-60% a good while ago.","So what we're just trying to do is give more updated guidance that we'll reach that earlier. But as I said before, that's not a way-station. I mean, we expect to just wave at that on the way past. We'll continue to have improvements as we go along.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks, Bill. All right. And then my follow-up is on the capital markets side. On the expense side of things, it didn't seem like we saw an expense impact from the better capital markets revenue in the quarter. Was it there? Or is it something that could be coming in next quarter? And then separately, on the capital markets revenue, I just wanted to see if we could get a little bit of commentary on your outlook there?","William Rogers","Yes, on the expense side, it's never sort of a perfect quarter-to-quarter match. So it's more important to look at it sort of on a broader base and the opportunities. And it was broader-based. I mean, the capital markets increases came from a variety of different businesses.","Our sort of core M&A and core investments that we've made in our equity capital markets business we saw good activity from. We saw a little more on the interest rate derivatives side, so clients starting some hedging activity, which I think we probably would have even anticipated that earlier, and I think is a good indicator of things to come.","We mentioned before investment banking from non-CIB is up 30% year-to-date. So that's creating capacity. We're in new markets. I think it's just a combination of things, but what I think most importantly is that it was broad-based, and it's reflective of our advice-centered strategy.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks, Bill.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Good morning, guys, Allison, you talked about the trajectory of the net interest margin up 0 to 2 basis points that you guys have continued to beat over the last few quarters. And I guess, a two-part question. Just first, what's assumed within that in terms of betas?","And then second, can you just talk about what you're seeing on the deposit side? You mentioned migration into CDs. Has there been any movement in terms of retail pricing? And just given that your loan-to-deposit ratio is in the 80s, can you talk about the appetite to pay up for deposits versus potentially optimizing on the deposit side?","Alison Dukes","Sure. So let me take your first one. In terms of our NIM guidance of 0 to 2 basis points in the third quarter, our assumption there is about a 35% beta. So a modest pickup in betas relative to the second quarter, kind of consistent with some of the upward pressure, and I think we're seeing a pretty broad-based right now. And just keep in mind that third quarter has an extra day relative to second quarter, so there's a little bit of a headwind there, which is what gets us back to that 0 to 2 guidance as we think about it. You are correct on CDs. You certainly see a pickup in CDs on our balance sheet. That's, for us, a very attractive cost of funding. We've been using that very deliberately as a tool to manage our asset rate sensitivity and control the pressure on betas as well. And as we think about our loan-to-deposit ratio and where that heads. I mean, certainly, that's going to be loan growth, in particular, is going to be one of the biggest drivers on that upward pressure on betas. If you think about second quarter relative to first quarter, our loan growth was a little bit softer. We were able to maintain betas a little bit lower. We're very pleased with -- I'm sorry, that was first quarter relative to fourth quarter. If you think about second quarter loan growth, which was a nice pickup in activity and balances, and you see that upward pressure on deposit betas as well. So going forward, betas and our loan-to-deposit ratio are going to be pretty closely correlated.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then, Bill, maybe a question on capital. I guess, with this year's plan, you're clearly starting to make some progress in bringing the capital levels down. Do you still feel that running the capital somewhere in the 8s is the right level for the organization? How do you think about the mix in terms of the use of capital? And then second, just as the efficiency continues to improve and the capital comes out, where do you think returns to the organization could ultimately get to?","William Rogers","Yes. So I do think we still have more opportunity on the capital side, and we've said if there were an optimal capital level, it would probably have an 8% handle on it in some way. So that indicates 75 to 100 basis points in terms of opportunity. When and how we get there is, obviously, has a lot of factors attached to it. And I think the language and the thought process around tailored regulation and around speed are -- we've got more tailwind than headwind there than has existed in the past. What was the second part of the question?","Ryan Nash","Where do you think the combination of lower capital and improving efficiency could get [indiscernible]","William Rogers","Oh, yes, sure. Yes. We're at a nice inflection point in terms of total return right now. We're at a nice inflection point because we've got a good operating environment and particularly strong operating environment from a credit standpoint. We've said 14% to 16%. We're, obviously, sort of exceeding that right now. I think as we think through what a more normalized environment looks like, so think about what more normalized looks like long -- medium term and long term from a credit performance standpoint as well as get some more light and some more clarity around when we can get to a lower capital ratio, I think, will clear that up better. But I feel more confident about operating at the high end of that range than I do about being at the low end of that range, if that will narrow it a bit.","Operator","And next we go to the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Amanda Larsen","This is Amanda Larsen on for Ken. The fee performance this quarter was quite strong in wholesale, including the IB and trading as noted, and a bit weaker in mortgage from the lower gain on sale margins and elevated decay as you noted. Looking at 3Q, can you help us level set on some of those significant items that may or may not repeat?","William Rogers","Yes. I'd rather not sort of go Q-to-Q, but let me sort of talk more at a higher level around both of those. I think in mortgage, we're now entering into a normalized purchase market. And a normalized purchase market will have better second and third quarters on the production side, and will have more decay on the second and third quarters from the servicing side. So for mortgage, barring anything radically different, I think the second half might look a bit like the first half, and it'll be weighted a little differently with production and servicing. As it relates to the capital markets business, we feel good about the pipelines, we feel good about the business. Obviously, the first quarter was a bit slower. The second quarter was more reflective, I think, of the opportunity that we have within our business. So if we look there on a first half to second half, I would expect the second half, given economic opportunities and no major upsets in the market, would be better than the first half. Does that help?","Amanda Larsen","Yes.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to ask a little bit more about your comments, Bill, earlier about waving at 60% or sub-60% efficiency ratio on your way past. As you think about the progress and the constant optimization the company has undergone and the revenue potential, I'm wondering where you think the tangible efficiency ratio potential is going to be from a range perspective over the medium term and how you define the medium term?","William Rogers","Yes. I mean, I've said, Erika, without wanting to sort of put up a final label because then that assumes that you're complete. So this -- in my mind, this process doesn't have a finality attached to it. So if you define the medium term as 2 to 4 years, I sort of -- I said we have -- I can see several hundred basis points of opportunity within that time line and range. I want to be careful about getting caught up to a quarter-by-quarter or a really specific guidance as it relates to that only because I don't want to limit the company in terms of our ability to invest and the opportunities that we may see. So I'm not trying to be clever, but just trying to say we do have more opportunity. We can see that over the medium term, but we don't want to put a final number in place because this isn't embedded. I mean, this is part of what we do. This is the culture of our organization. This is not a project. This is not a one-time thing. This is not something that's over. This is just now how we run our company.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And as a follow-up question to that, Allison, I just wanted to inquire about your comments on the net interest margin and wanted to make sure I didn't misunderstand it. So you've mentioned that each subsequent Fed rate hike would be less impactful positively for the margin, and you're guiding 0 to 2 basis points of margin expansion in the third quarter. Does that mean that for each subsequent rate hike beyond June that funding cost repricing will offset asset yield repricing? And as -- just really quickly on that, as we think about the balance between deposit pricing and alternate sources of funding, could you give us a sense of what the cost is of new alternate sources of funding if necessary?","Alison Dukes","So let me take the first one on NIM and the value of a Fed rate hike. As betas are around, let's call it, 30% or so where they've been today, then the value of a Fed rate hike is about 2 basis points of NIM for us. So as betas increase, the value of that Fed rate hike starts to come down. It starts to be neutral to NIM, somewhere around a 50% beta. So as you think about our guidance for the third quarter, and going forward, it's just -- it's really a function of how much pressure there is on betas. As we think about alternate funding sources and what that could look like, again, a lot of factors that go into that, but it could be anywhere from 0 to 50 basis points depending on what we use and some are just the rate curve and the market pressure at the time.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Saul Martinez of UBS.","Saul Martinez","A couple of questions. If I could just follow up on -- actually on Erika's question first. Can you just talk a little bit about the glide path on -- of the 35% beta? And when you see -- or if you see us getting to a 50% beta during this Fed fund cycle, assuming a terminal Fed fund around the 3%, which is sort of the market expectation? Just curious how you look at that and where you think betas go from here.","Alison Dukes","Sure. So hard to say exactly when betas get to any sort of range, in particular. I mean, it's a function of 3 things: one, the absolute level of rates; two, the pace of rate hikes; and three, the level of loan growth that we experience. And so not being able to predict some of those things, we think it will take a few more quarters, but again, any one of those factors could change that.","Saul Martinez","Okay. No, that's helpful. And if I could just ask a bit of a broader question. I think you guys have been pretty forward-thinking in terms of digital banking and just technology overall and, at the same time, you've been reducing your branch footprint for a while and continue to do so. So I'm curious what your view is on the national digital banking strategy that a lot of your peers have adopted. Do you think that's a -- how do you think about that in terms of your own strategy? Do you think it makes sense, for example, as a deposit gathering tool or client acquisition tool?","William Rogers","If we define the term of a national digital bank as something that's a national platform that creates new channels and creates new clients, we've had a digital bank for a while, called LightStream. We've been primarily focused on the asset side of that equation, and it has allowed us to do all of that. It's allowed us to diversify our mix, and it's allowed us to acquire new clients. It puts us in a lot of markets where we weren't before. We've got other national businesses as well that we expand relationships with from indirect auto to mortgage correspondent, whatever it may be, that we have an opportunity to leverage relationships on a more national basis. Now that being said, on the liabilities side, we're pursuing that. We're sort of looking at our options and really haven't declared our preferred approach. But the advent of being in the national digital market to acquire new clients, we sort of think we've been on that forefront for quite a while.","Saul Martinez","Okay. That's helpful. But it is something, Bill, that you're kind of considering in terms of whether you think it makes sense for you.","William Rogers","Oh, yes, absolutely. As I said, I think we're exploring a lot of different options. We have some unique advantages, we think, with branding and investments that we've already made, and we want to make sure that we leverage those to their best advantage.","Alison Dukes","I'm going to jump in and let me just clear up one thing on my answer to Erika's earlier question on alternative funding sources. I just want to make sure that the cost of that is 0 to 50 basis points over LIBOR.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Moss from B. Riley FBR.","Steve Moss","I wanted to follow up on funding sources here. You've spoken a lot about the liability side. Wondering what is your appetite for using investment securities to fund loan growth as the curve flattens here.","Alison Dukes","I think that we're going to remain focused on keeping our investment portfolio generally consistent with the overall size of our balance sheet. Our investment portfolio is really there to help us manage our interest rate sensitivity. So as we think about funding loan growth, we're really thinking about deposits and alternative funding sources.","Steve Moss","Okay. Got you. And then appreciate the color on the efficiency ratio guidance. I guess, just wanted more -- a little bit more of a housekeeping item. With regard to outside software expense, is that a good run rate going forward? Or is that just a one-time?","William Rogers","Yes, it's going to -- it fluctuates quarter-to-quarter. So it's not something that you necessarily annualize. But it is a reflection of some of the investments that we've made and the relative amortization of those investments take different forms relative to what we've done and the shelf lives and those kinds of things. So again, not to annualize the number, but also look at it as a positive investment towards the revenue and client-facing part of what we do.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets.","Gerard Cassidy","Bill, can you give us your thoughts -- obviously, you guys have invested quite heavily in technology and have done a very good job with LightStream, as you know. Can you share with us, is the technology spend in the digitalization that you and your peers are doing, can you view that as table stakes, meaning, it just gets you into the ballpark, it doesn't give you the competitive advantage, and it really comes down to execution and delivering on the field? Or do you think, no, this is the competitive advantage that you have it and others don't?","William Rogers","The answer is yes. I mean, it's sort of both. It's both highly offensive and highly defensive in terms of how we think about it. We really approach the business very much as a digital first type of approach. I mean, that's been a fundamental change in our strategic thinking now for several years. And what you see from us is you see high adoption rates, really good increases in sign-ons. 28% or so of our sales in this quarter were digitally assisted. So I think there's a lot of meeting client expectations around the digital side. But then there are ways to use it and you mentioned LightStream as just one example. But just in expanding client relationships and managing data and analytics and leveraging AI to more fully light the way to financial well-being for our clients that we do think are competitive advantages. So I think it's a combination of both. And again, you've seen from us, I think, really good adoption from our clients and that's -- all of that's reflective in the results that we've been talking about.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then as a follow-up, obviously, we've been through cycles, and we know what to expect in a credit cycle, and many banks, yours included, will underwrite loans maybe more conservatively or better after going through a tough credit cycle. With all the digitalization and the AI and all the technology you folks are using, how do you assure yourself that you're not over-reliant on this technology to protect yourself and it could, actually, lead you astray because you're not -- it's too much technology and it's not enough human common sense or human touch.","William Rogers","Yes. I'm staring at our Chief Risk Officer who is maybe offended by the lack of common sense...","Gerard Cassidy","No offense is intended.","William Rogers","No, I know, I know, I'm just teasing. I mean, I think, clearly, there is a lot of common sense embedded in the whole part of what we do. But I think the more sophisticated answer to your question is we stress it a lot. So we're constantly stressing the portfolio for virtually any way you can think about, stress it for rates, stress it for commodity prices, stress it for different economic environments. And I think that's sort of the litmus test is that we're constantly looking over the shoulder of our own decision-making to make sure that we're on the right track. And the most obvious public representation of that is CCAR. If you look at our portfolio under an adverse stressed conditions, we have continued now for several years to perform at a very low level, but most importantly, with a really low standard deviation. So this isn't something that's fluctuating CCAR-to- CCAR cycle. We've been very, very consistent in what we do. And as a total percentage of our automated underwriting, if you look at sort of our total portfolio, it's a pretty small percentage. I mean, at the end of the day, there is a lot of still human intervention supported and enhanced by digital capability.","Ankur Vyas","Julia, it looks like there's no one left in the queue, so this concludes our call.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call, and thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website at www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially in our press release and SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website at www.suntrust.com.","Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Kris. In our normal fashion, I'm going to begin today's call with a brief overview of the quarter. After passing it to Aleem, I'll wrap up with an update on our expense saving program and provide some recent line of business highlights.","First, I'll begin by acknowledging there are a lot of moving parts this quarter. We have endeavored in our remarks today and throughout the presentation to provide you clarity on those items and how they impacted the results. Aleem will provide more details momentarily, and I think you'll see that we continued the trend of delivering improved core performance. Further, we're positioned to more favorably coming out of the quarter in large part due to the actions we announced in September. Our overall risk profiles improved, and our balance sheet is strengthened. This is highlighted by lower nonperforming and delinquent loans and a mortgage repurchase reserve that now fully covers estimated remaining losses on the pre-2009 vintage GSE loans. As you know, those are the loans from which the vast majority of demands and losses have been generated, and we're able to accomplish all of this while continuing to grow our capital base this quarter.","Now turning to the presentation. Slide 3 summarizes some of the key drivers of our third quarter results. Earnings per share was $1.98 with the actions we announced last month contributing $1.40 per share. The diversity of our revenue streams benefited us this quarter. Mortgage production was again strong and investment banking income also increased, while net interest income and margin were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Expenses were up on a reported basis, but excluding the non-core items, they were stable the last quarter and down from the prior year. As you're aware, this continues to be an area where we have lots of focus as we strive to achieve our ultimate goal of a sub-60 efficiency ratio. I'm going to talk more about this in context of our PPG program later in the call.","Taking a look at the balance sheet. Overall loan growth was slower, but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, drove a nearly $1 billion increase in average performing loan balances over last quarter and a nearly $10 billion increase over last year. This more than offset certain real estate-related loans that we have been actively managing down.","Now on the deposit side, the favorable mix continued with average DDA growth of 3% from the prior quarter and 19% from the prior year.","From a credit perspective, derisking of the balance sheet helped drive a 30% reduction in nonperforming loans over last quarter and a 47% decline from last year.","And as I mentioned earlier, our capital position continued to increase with our Tier 1 common equity ratio estimated at 9.8%, up 40 basis points from last quarter.","All in all, we're continuing to demonstrate improved core performance. And that, coupled with proactive actions we took this quarter, positions us well for the future.","I'm going to turn it over to Aleem, let him walk you through the details and I'll give you more -- and give you more clarity on the quarter's results. Aleem?","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. After several noise-free quarters and consistently improving results, as Bill noted, we had a number of lumpy items that impacted the third quarter. So I'll spend a few minutes grounding you on them before we get to the -- in the operating results.","If you turn to Slide 4, I'll start with an update on the items we preannounced in September. The acceleration of the agreement regarding our Coca-Cola shares generated $1.9 billion in securities gains, and the charitable contribution of 1 million Coke shares to the SunTrust Foundation resulted in the recognition of $38 million of expense.","Our third quarter mortgage repurchase provision was $371 million. Consistent with last month's announcement, and as Bill noted earlier, we expect the resulting mortgage repurchase reserve to be sufficient to cover the estimated remaining losses from pre-2009 vintage loans sold to the GSEs.","During the third quarter, we transferred to held for sale slightly over $0.5 billion of nonperforming mortgage and commercial real estate loans. The total net charge-offs recognized in writing the loans down to disposition value was $172 million. The majority of the loan sales were completed during the third quarter with only about $40 million in net balances remaining to be sold this quarter.","We also transferred to held for sale $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. In doing so, we wrote these loans down to the expected sales price and the $92 million charge, most of which was associated with the delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, was a reduction to noninterest income. You will recall, the majority of the combined $1.9 billion in student and Ginnie Mae loans we're selling are more than 90 days delinquent. Their disposition reduces our delinquency ratio and makes the size of our government-guaranteed loan portfolio more consistent with our longer-term balance sheet targets. All of the transferred loans were included in loans held for sale at quarter end. To date, in the fourth quarter, we've already sold $1 billion of student loans and we expect to complete the remaining student and Ginnie Mae sales by year end.","We also transferred approximately $190 million of affordable housing investments to held for sale during the quarter. The $96 million write-down taken upon the transfer was recorded as a noninterest expense, and the resultant carrying value reflects our best estimate of the ultimate disposition price. We expect this sale will be completed in the second quarter of 2013.","Combined, the preannounced items contributed $753 million in net income or $1.40 per common share to the third quarter results. This was exactly on our prior guidance.","Shifting to the bottom portion of Slide 4, you see 4 other items, the first of which relates to a credit policy change. During the third quarter, we moved the timing of charge-off recognition for junior lien loans from 180 days to 120 days. Our analysis indicated that when junior lien loans go 120 days past due, they rarely cure and typically roll to 180 days. Accordingly, we altered our policy, which resulted in the accelerated recognition of $65 million in incremental net charge-offs in the quarter. For clarity, this is not related to the policy change other large banks made this quarter regarding the treatment of consumer loans that were not reaffirmed following Chapter 7 bankruptcy. We have not received such guidance from our regulator and have not taken any action in response. However, we are monitoring developments. We do estimate that we have approximately $400 million of such loans, about 35% of which are already classified as performing TDRs. We expect to receive coordinated regulatory guidance on this issue and will take any appropriate action at that time.","I'll cover the final 3 items on the page fairly quickly. I'm pleased to note that our credit spreads tightened considerably in the third quarter. Unfortunately, this also resulted in $41 million in mark-to-market losses on our fair value debt, which reduced noninterest income. Next, we accrued $29 million in severance expense associated with post-PPG efforts to streamline our organization and achieve our efficiency ratio objectives. And lastly, we incurred a $17 million expense associated with reassessments and ultimate reduction of our real estate needs.","Slide 5 provides a summary income statement and the collective impact of the items that I just reviewed are apparent. Third quarter noninterest income was up substantially from prior quarters and the gain from the Coca-Cola transaction more than offset the increased mortgage repurchase provision, the write-down on the student and Ginnie Mae loan sales and the mark-to-market loss on the fair value debt. Provision for credit losses increased this quarter due to the NPL sales and the credit policy change. Expenses were higher due to the affordable write-- affordable housing write-down, the Coke shares donation, severance and the real estate charges.","Looking at the bottom line, third quarter 2012 earnings per share of $1.98 is up markedly compared to the prior quarters. Obviously, a lot of the favorable variance is driven by the $1.40 per share impact of the September actions. After backing that out, this quarter's EPS of $0.58 continued our favorable core earnings trends, and it compares favorably to the $0.39 from a year ago and the $0.50 from last quarter.","Subsequent slides provide clearer views of our underlying trends. So let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion of net interest income, which was $1.3 billion this quarter and the margin was 3.38%, both of which were down slightly from the prior quarter. Interest income from earning assets declined about $50 million sequentially. This was driven by 3 primary factors: first, we experienced 10 basis points of loan yield compression, mainly driven by mortgage and C&I as new loans that we're originating are coming on the books at lower yields than those that are paying off; second, we saw a 38-basis point decline in our securities yield, which was largely attributable to the elimination of the $15 million quarterly Coke dividend; and lastly, we continue to modestly reduce the size of our bond portfolio in light of the lack of attractive investment alternatives.","On the liability side, interest expense declined sequentially by $44 million, and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was managed down by 14 basis points. This was driven by the reduced funding needs associated with the smaller balance sheet, the previously announced redemption of $1.2 billion of higher cost trust preferred securities early in the quarter and the maturity of a population of higher-cost CDs, which helped drive the overall cost of time deposits down about 20 basis points.","Relative to the prior year, net interest income was up modestly, and the margin declined 10 basis points. Key drivers were lower earning asset yields, higher loan balances and reduced interest costs associated with an improved deposit mix, lower deposit rates paid and a reduction in long-term debt.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to see a reduction in the net interest margin on the order of mid-single digit basis points, driven by additional reductions in asset yields, which will partially be offset by lower liability costs. In the fourth quarter, we expect a reduction to net interest income as a result of the lower margin, coupled with our smaller balance sheet due to the closed and pending loan sales.","Let's turn to Slide 7 for a discussion of noninterest income. As we discussed earlier, reported noninterest income was up substantially this quarter due to the favorable net impact associated with the September actions. As usual, we've also provided a view of our adjusted noninterest income, and we detail the adjustments in the Appendix. The $216 million sequential quarter increase in the mortgage repurchase provision, which is booked as a contra-revenue drove the decline in adjusted noninterest income from the second quarter. Otherwise, fee income trends this quarter were solid. Most notable was core mortgage production. Excluding the impact of the repurchase provision, mortgage production income hit a record high this quarter and increased $49 million or almost 20% sequentially. Production volume was high and stable to the second quarter level of about $8 billion, which was split roughly 70-30 between refinancings and purchases.","Looking ahead, while it is reasonable to assume some volume and margin compression, we do expect overall conditions in the mortgage market to continue to remain favorable in the near term.","Investment banking was another business that was up sequentially, driven by strong syndication volume. Conversely, the other charges and fee category declined as a result of lower commitment fees, and card fees fell due to a reclassification of card rewards costs. Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income declined $111 million, driven by a $254 million increase in the mortgage repurchase provision. Apart from this, adjusted noninterest income increased $143 million or 15%. Similar to the sequential quarter comparisons, strong core mortgage production was the primary driver and higher investment banking revenue also contributed, driven by syndication and bond origination fees. Conversely, card fees declined, primarily due to the impacts of regulatory reform.","Let's turn to Slide 8 to take a look at mortgage repurchases. For consistency's sake, we've continued to share with you the same layout of this page from prior quarters. But obviously, the important news on the mortgage repurchase issue for us this quarter was contained within our September announcement. Specifically, as a result of additional information we received from both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, coupled with our own analysis of the patterns of demands and full file requests, we were able to more precisely estimate the remaining losses on pre-2009 GSE loans, the population of loans that to date have accounted for about 95% of all repurchase losses. As such, we recorded a $371 million provision this quarter, and the resulting mortgage reserve, which you can see on the bottom left of this page, increased to $694 million. Looking forward, we expect this reserve level to decline as the losses are recognized.","The top left portion of this slide shows that demand has declined to $405 million this quarter, driven primarily by the 2006 to '08 vintages. Demand levels could continue to vary in the coming quarters; however, the trends and full file requests precursors to future demands are improving in 2 ways: first, the absolute number of full file requests is declining. This suggests that, over time, we should begin seeing a decline in the overall level of demands; second, the percentage of full file requests for loans that have never been 120 days past due is increasing, and more recently, delinquent loans tend to have better cure rates. The pending demand population, which is displayed on the top right portion of this page increased to $690 million. This is due to the new demands and a modest extension of resolution time lines. We continue to take a deliberate approach in reviewing repurchase demands, ensuring that we repurchase loans where appropriate yet cure the defects or moderate losses wherever possible. Overall, and in line with what we said in September, the mortgage repurchase trends continue to play out in a manner consistent with our expectations and information we receive from the agencies.","Let's move on to expenses. Adjusted expenses were essentially stable to the prior quarter. Other real estate costs declined $22 million due to lower losses on disposition, and outside processing fell $9 million. These were offset by increases in employee compensation and FDIC premiums. The $18 million compensation increase was largely due to the accelerated vesting of deferred compensation associated with certain organizational changes and, to a lesser degree, higher contract labor costs. $7 million increase in our FDIC premium is due to quarterly variability in the assessment rate. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses declined $24 million or 2%, credit-related costs declined driven by a combined $38 million reduction in other real estate and collection services expenses. FDIC premiums also fell by $13 million. Partially offsetting these reductions was an employee compensation and benefits increase of $30 million. This was in part due to the aforementioned accelerated vesting of certain deferred compensation, as well as an overall improvement in business performance.","As we look to the fourth quarter, we currently expect our adjusted expenses to be flat to down. Cyclically, high costs are expected to continue their overall declining trend and employee compensation is expected to decline. Conversely, certain volume and seasonally driven line items, for example, outside processing and advertising, may increase.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased by about $900 million or 1%. Growth was driven again this quarter by C&I, which was up $1.1 billion or 2%, and came predominantly from large corporate clients with not-for-profit and auto dealer also contributing. Period-end C&I growth was less robust than in recent quarters as we saw some slowing of loan demand due to borrowers' uncertainties associated with the economic environment and the fiscal cliff. This said, loan pipelines still remain fairly strong. I'll also point out that our corporate investment banking unit has benefited from the increased activity in the bond market via improving bond origination fees during the last couple of quarters. Relative to the prior year, performing loans increased by $9.5 billion or 8%. C&I was the largest driver, up $5.7 billion or 12%, with growth across a diverse array of industry verticals. Additionally, guaranteed student loans were up by $2.4 billion and guaranteed mortgages, non-guaranteed mortgages and indirect consumer all increased by around $1 billion. The overall portfolio growth was partially offset by intentional declines in home equity, commercial real estate and construction. The effects of this derisking are shown on Slide 11.","The portfolios that we've categorized as higher risk declined by another $0.5 billion this quarter. While we've continued to apply the higher-risk label to this grouping of loans, I'd point out that 95% of this book is accruing. And of that, 98% is current on principal and interest. The non-accruing high-risk loans have been appropriately reserved for and the accruing book looks a lot like the rest of our portfolio. For example, the weighted average refreshed FICO scores of the higher-risk mortgage and home equity books are well above 700. Due to the improved performance of the higher-risk book and its smaller absolute size, you can expect to hear less about this portfolio in future quarters.","You see in the bottom part of this page that the government-guaranteed portfolio declined by $2.3 billion this quarter. This is largely due to the transfers to held for sale of $1.4 billion of student loans and $0.5 billion of Ginnie Mae loans. In the fourth quarter, we also expect to transfer to held for sale another approximately $600 million of student loans. This $600 million was included in the loan sale guidance that we gave in September, but did not meet the held for sale accounting criteria at quarter end. We do not expect the gain or loss associated with the fourth quarter transfer to be material.","Let's take a look at Slide 12 for a review of credit trends. Overall, the credit story is again an improving one this quarter. Early-stage delinquency ratios were relatively stable to the prior quarter. Consumer loans saw normal seasonal increases, which were partially offset by declines in home equity delinquencies. Excluding government-guaranteed loans, consumer and commercial delinquency ratios were 58 and 18 basis points, respectively, which are at relatively low levels. As such, and as is the case with most of our credit metrics, we would expect residential loans to drive future improvements as residential delinquencies are still somewhat elevated by historical standards at just above 1%.","Nonperforming assets and nonperforming loans were down by over $700 million from the prior quarter. A 30% sequential quarter decline in nonperforming loans was largely due to the $544 million sale of the mortgage and CRE NPLs. However, excluding these sales, NPLs still declined by about $185 million or over 7%. This decline came despite our adding to NPL, for regulatory guidance, $81 million in junior lien loans that are current on their payments but subordinate to a delinquent risk mortgage. At quarter end, our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was 1.42%, down from 1.97% last quarter and 2.76% a year ago. This brought our allowance to NPL ratio up to 130%, a rise of 36 percentage points from the second quarter.","Net charge-offs this quarter were $511 million as compared to $350 million last quarter. Included in this quarter's figure is the $172 million in net charge-offs associated with the NPL sales and the $65 million from the junior lien credit policy change. Backing these 2 figures out, net charge-offs were $274 million, down $76 million sequentially. Core net charge-offs have trended favorably for some time and we expect that overall trend to continue in the coming quarters. We could see some increase in the fourth quarter from this $274 million level though as a function of some normal seasonality and the fact that our recoveries were about $30 million higher this quarter than what we've experienced recently.","The allowance for loan and lease losses ended the quarter at $2.2 billion, down about $60 million from the prior quarter, due to the improving core credit quality trends. Despite the modest dollar decline in the allowance this quarter, the allowance ratio remained essentially unchanged at 1.84% on a stated basis or just above 2% when excluding government-guaranteed loans from the calculation.","Taking a step back, when you take a look at what we have done to improve the risk profile of the organization over the last little while, the last 2 slides make that really evident. We've been aggressively and intentionally reducing our higher-risk book for several years. Those balances are down by $14.6 billion or more than 60% over the past few years, so our derisking is largely complete. Nonperforming loans have been on a similar trajectory, down by $3.8 billion or almost 70% since their peak in 2009. And we took actions to further accelerate this decline this quarter as well as reduce our 90-day plus delinquency ratio. Overall, we have made meaningful and substantial strides that have resulted in a much improved risk profile for SunTrust.","Let's next take a look at our deposit performance. Average deposit balances declined modestly from the prior quarter and the favorable shift in deposit mix continued. Noninterest-bearing deposits were up $1.3 billion or 3%. This was essentially offset by a $1.2 billion or 7% reduction in time deposits as we had an above average amount of CD maturities during the third quarter. We also saw a modest decline in money market balances as we're being deliberate about pricing discipline and have let certain promotional rates expire. Relative to the prior year, deposits are up $2.4 billion or about 2%. Lower-cost accounts are the driver of the growth, led by almost $6 billion or 19% DDA growth. Conversely, higher-cost time deposits are down by $3.4 billion or 17%.","Slide 14 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital increased by approximately $400 million. Recall that the September actions were essentially neutral to our regulatory capital level, so this quarter's increase is primarily driven by core earnings. The Tier 1 common ratio ended the quarter at an estimated 9.8%, up a healthy 40 basis points from last quarter. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserve's recent notice of proposed rulemaking are implemented in their current form, held relatively stable at 7.9%.","As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio increased by 16 basis points sequentially due to a reduction in the asset base, and tangible book value per share ended the quarter at $25.72, down 1% from the prior quarter as the modest tangible book value dilution associated with the September actions was largely offset by this quarter's core earnings.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover the last few slides.","William Henry Rogers","Okay, and I'll move to Slide 15. And during the third quarter, we achieved our PPG expense program target well ahead of schedule, realizing a little over $75 million in quarterly savings or obviously $300 million on an annualized run rate. The collective efforts that got us here so quickly should not be minimized. A lot was accomplished in a relatively short period of time, and that's a result of our teammates' intensity around delivering results. But that being said, it's not lost on me or anyone at SunTrust that we still have work to do. The PPG program served as a catalyst towards achieving our ultimate goal of significantly improving the overall efficiency of the organization. It's been successful in not only garnering meaningful savings, but also in galvanizing our team in pursuit of our sub-60 efficiency ratio goal.","So now that we've hit our PPG target, what kind of updates can you expect from here? Well, we're not going to roll out a new program with a new name nor will we publicly track our progress beyond the $300 million goal. But I will tell you that we're not finished in our efforts to improve our efficiency. As a matter of fact, we're just getting started. And going forward, I want you to measure us by the same metric that we're holding ourselves accountable, our efficiency ratio. We've incorporated this metric into our incentive compensation plans. We've built a lot of intensity throughout the bank, around improving both the revenue and expense components of the calculation. So PPG was instrumental in getting us on the track and we'll leverage that momentum as we go forward.","Now moving to the next slide, and before we move into Q&A, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting the progress we've made from a line-of-business perspective.","In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we've had another quarter of solid loan production growth with year-to-date volume 15% ahead of last year. Favorable deposit trends also continued as we generated year-over-year DDA growth of 14%. And though from a revenue perspective, this business continues to be challenged due to regulatory headwinds, we have reduced expenses here by 3% from last year. Clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels, which, as just one example, has enabled us to make changes to our staffing model to improve our efficiency and effectiveness. Our Wholesale business continues to deliver strong results with year-to-date net income nearly double what it was a year ago. Significant growth in capital markets fees, coupled with a higher net interest income, drove Wholesale revenue gains of 14% over the third quarter of last year. Loans were up 8% and client deposits increased 5%. Furthermore, our Corporate Investment Banking business surpassed last quarter's revenue and net income levels, marking yet another quarter of record performance. While the Mortgage business reported a net loss, primarily due to the increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve and the mortgage NPL sale, core trends continued to markedly improve. Year-to-date mortgage production volume was $24 billion, up nearly $8 billion or 48% from last year and core mortgage origination income was $460 million higher, more than 130% increase from last year. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly been beneficial to the business while we're also continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, a core bread-and-butter business for us, and one that we think will again be the primary driver of mortgage revenue when the refi volume eventually tapers off. Additionally, we're also focused on building out channels and driving volume with better channel selection to maximize ROI and the longer-term return profile for this business.","So overall, this marked another quarter of positively trending core line of business performance. The diversity of our business mix has and will continue to benefit us as we go forward, and I'm pleased with the heightened intensity level at which our leaders and teammates are operating, focused on meeting our clients' needs and driving higher levels of return for our shareholders.","So Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we'll take some questions.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Bill. Wendy, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Wonder if you can give us more color on your -- possibly your 2013 margin outlook given your securities yields and loan yields you're seeing some downside reinvestment risk there, but relatively more resilient than we thought this quarter. So can you just give a little more color in terms of your outlook beyond the fourth quarter?","William Henry Rogers","Sure, John. Well, as you know, the big issue, obviously, is that the new loans coming on are coming on at lower going-on yields than the roll-off and securities continue to pay down. We're being very careful with the way in which we reinvest our securities book. Obviously, we're not really getting paid given the flat yield curve that take a lot of duration risk. And you saw that impact a little bit in the size of our securities book coming down a little bit this quarter. But I think what you'll see for the whole industry, as you look out, if we stay in this lower for longer environment through next year, I think you'll see the whole industry start to decrease margins probably in the, sort of, a few basis points per quarter every quarter just continuing to grind down.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that guidance you have for the fourth quarter, is that fair to assume that, that's the pace of compression to expect going through '13, or could that accelerate at all just as your funding cost leverage gradually abates?","Aleem Gillani","It may accelerate, it may decelerate, too. I don't know that it's a consistent every-quarter decline. There is some variability quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, we did receive the benefit of a number of our higher-cost CDs rolling off and that's why our margin declined only 1 basis point overall. So I think you look for some volatility with some quarters declining less and some quarters declining more. But if you look out at the trend overall, I'd look for it to be generally on the order of a few basis points a quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So when you think about the expense base, now you have all of PPG in the run rate, I'm seeing a core efficiency ratio of somewhere in the mid-60s. So can you just talk a little bit more about how you plan on closing the gap to get below 60%? I know you highlighted that you're just getting started and clearly it's a big focus internally, but can you talk about some of the levers that you still have on the expense side, particularly if the revenue picture remains weak? And from there, if you would assess the driver of reaching the targeted levels, will we need to see more on the revenue side or the expense side from here to get there?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, so to start with, I think you've got it figured out. Obviously, this quarter's efficiency ratio is a little lower. We were very clear internally that it wasn't mission accomplished. If you think about our core expense base, say, over the last 6 quarters, it's been fairly stable, so call it sort of $1.5 billion sort of core expense base. But the revenue sort of has gone from about $2.2 billion to about $2.4 billion. So you could say one side of the coin was we'd expect to see more expense savings at this particular juncture. But we've had a couple of our businesses, mortgages and -- mortgage and CIB has been sort of 2 of the examples that we're going to invest in right now because we see good revenue opportunities. So think about it sort of from that context. So what's left, I mean what are the opportunities? I mean, the list is pretty significant. We have a lot more to do in the consumer rationalization of our business spans and layers, incentive efficiencies. You saw some of the charges we took for real estate, so we still have some other real estate opportunities. Core process, consolidation, shared services. I mean, the list is actually fairly extensive. And while I said PPG was the start, I mean I meant that. I mean, it really sort of got the ball rolling down the hill. I would call that maybe some of the more low-lying fruit. Now we're going to get a little higher in the tree. But there are significant opportunities. Is it more expense or is it more revenue? A lot of that'll depend on where the market takes us. If refinance activity continues like we think it will in Mortgage, it'll be a little slower to get down to that efficiency ratio. We continue to do what we've been able to do on the CIB side. Similarly, it'll take a little bit longer. So I think it's -- and we've been very clear about saying it's the efficiency ratio versus just expense or just revenue initiatives. And I'm confident that we're on the path. I can't commit to the exact time line, but I'm confident we're on the path. And if you look into our line of businesses, start looking at the efficiency improvements within those and I think they're pretty good leading indicators of where we're going as a total company.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then if I could just ask one follow-up as a follow-up to John's question. When you think about -- you obviously said the NIMs coming down a couple of basis points a quarter, but when you think about the trajectory for NII for 4Q and beyond, how should we think about, just given Aleem's comments on asset yield spreads and reinvestment yields, should we expect that NII is going to come down at a similar pace, or do you think we can actually see enough growth to offset some of the compression?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think for next year, Ryan, I would think about NII for the full year likely to be lower than the full year 2012. Basically, we've got the changes from the foregone dividend and Coca-Cola and the loan sales. In Q2, recall we had a step-down in loan swap income. So full year I would think of as being lower next year than this year. There's some positives and negatives there. On the positive side, we are continuing to manage down our non-deposit maturity rates. Obviously, in the compressed yield environment on liabilities, there's a decreasing opportunity there, but we do have more CDs maturing. We have about $7 billion of CDs maturing during the next 5 quarters, between now and the end of next year. And as those renew, they will renew at lower yields. And against that, we're fighting against the challenging asset yield compression environment. And as a reminder, we will have another step-down as a result of swaps rolling off in Q2 next year. So year-over-year, I would think of NII coming down overall, but we know we still have some levers to pull and we're working on those.","Operator","Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about mortgage repurchase, reps and warranties. Could you give us a sense as to how you think your expenses are going to be running over the next several quarters? I think, in September you said $5 million to $10 million a quarter. Just wondering if that's still a good number or not.","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I think it is. I think we said $10 million a quarter in September and we think that $10 million is still a reasonable number. Small range around that, probably sort of plus or minus $5 million. But I think that's a good center for the overall number.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And does that represent -- does that include the increases in repurchase requests that came through in the quarter? Obviously, they were up in the quarter.","Aleem Gillani","Well, the demands were actually down in the quarter, Q3 versus Q2. And I think they're down to the lowest level we've now seen in the last several quarters. But yes, it includes everything that we've seen so far and it includes the reserve that we need for new mortgages that we're putting on.","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Right. The pending repurchase requests were up, though?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, the pending repurchase requests were up, but that's partly as a result of us being very deliberate around looking at every single file and making sure that we take the time necessary to try to cure every issue rather than acceding to a demand.","William Henry Rogers","I think another way of saying it is really everything that we represented in terms of taking this reserve in September is as we thought it was or better, and particularly as it relates to full file requests, which is sort of that leading indicator, they're probably even better than we thought they'd be. In other words, lower.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just remind us what the swap impact on the NIM and the net interest income dollars will be? I guess, it's 1Q to 2Q where there's the step-down that you referenced?","Aleem Gillani","There is another step-down in Q2, Matt. I think we've got about $1 billion notional of swaps rolling off. And so that's about $10 million or $15 million per quarter in NII at that time.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, if we look at your credit-related costs, they were down both year-over-year and linked quarter and that's actually better than what we've seen at a number of other banks that have had Q2 increases. And just maybe wondering why there's some divergence maybe between you and the industry, and it sounds like those costs will continue to come down from here.","Aleem Gillani","We do expect those costs to continue to come down a little bit, Matt. I think, maybe to be fair to the rest of the industry, they've been a little slower in coming down here. So I think this quarter, we're catching up a little bit. And you'll recall that in September, we had guided some of those costs down by about $20 million per quarter for the end of the year and we achieved $15 million of that $20 million this quarter. So perhaps a little bit faster than we had anticipated then, but we do continue to expect those costs to continue to come down.","William Henry Rogers","And as, Matt, we've said, they'll continue to trend down quarter-to-quarter. It's hard to tell exactly what's going to happen, but I think it's safe to say that the trend will continue. The slope of this quarter may have been unusually high.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So the $20 million per quarter decline that you had signaled related to the balance sheet repositioning, is most of that in the run rate in the third quarter, so we should take this run rate and take out $5 million to get to the minus $20 million then whatever else we'd assume for the rest of the pool, is that the way to think about it?","William Henry Rogers","That's generally correct. There's obviously going to be some volatility. We're not going to be able to forecast these costs within $5 million on a quarterly basis, but that's generally correct. We expected to hit $20 million by year end. We achieved a lot of that very quickly. But after we hit the $20 million, I would continue to expect those costs to move down next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Jefferson Harralson with KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I want to ask you about the loan demand and that how one hand is talking about the slowing loan demand. On the other, you're talking about how the pipeline is strong. Can you talk about the kind of what you're seeing there to -- for those comments to both jive together?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, Jefferson, and it is a bit of a dichotomy of different views. But what we're seeing is some slowdown and I think that's not been inconsistent with sort of HA [ph] data on pricing. But our pipelines are actually very good and they are as large or not larger than they've been in prior quarters. The pull-through rate is just slower. And we could all speculate as to why that might be. I think there clearly is some pent-up demand. When I'm out and about and talking to business owners and other CEOs, what I hear is we're going to wait. So we're encouraged by the fact that the pipeline's up. We're encouraged by the fact that we're having increased higher-level dialogue with our clients, but the pull-through rate almost has -- was slower this quarter. No doubt about it.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right. So if you think about the 2% average loan growth this quarter, you think that should generally pick up or slow down or remain the same in the future?","William Henry Rogers","It's hard to speculate because we're sort of dealing with a bit of a new phenomenon here in that, normally, we could look at pipelines. We could ascribe a pull-through rate of some consistency against those and be able to project that with a lot more consistency. Today, there's a little bit more of an unknown. So while I'm optimistic overall in the sense that we're -- the pipelines are big and the activity and the dialogue, I'm a little hesitant to predict exactly what's going to happen in the next quarter or 2.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow on the environmental expense question real quick. So 2 of the most important lines within the operating losses and the credit and collection, they were slightly higher quarter-to-quarter and taking your point that it's hard to think about quarter-to-quarter, I just wanted to ask a more qualitative question. What does it take for those 2 lines to start -- I know you're expecting that those 2 subcategories are going to improve, but how long is the lag versus other credit improvement for operating losses and credit and collections, specifically, to really start moving down? Is there a trigger point where they just start to accelerate or is this a multi multiyear drag for them to meaningfully reduce?","William Henry Rogers","Well, Ken, I certainly hope it's not a multiyear drag. I don't know that there's a trigger point that I could point you to, but I think there are sort of several things that you could look at, the improvements that we've made over the last couple of years, particularly some of the actions that we took this quarter also. The sale of some of our NPL loans, the sale of the Ginnie Maes, that should help also reduce some of those credit and collection costs going forward. Those are very labor-intensive loans to attempt to collect and work on over time. So I think -- we would think of that as a little bit of a trigger point. And in operating losses, there are a lot of numbers built into there -- built into that, that includes operational losses, that includes broad losses, it includes items we've got in there to build up litigation reserves. There are a lot of different numbers in there and I would look for that line to also start to come down relatively quickly as we start to think about 2013 now. And in fairness, it's not all these numbers and it's other numbers as well. But I've been pretty clear in stating that we're going to be conservative in taking some of these costs down. I mean, this was a very expensive system to build. We're really, really good at it. And so some of these hard costs and tracking this down, we're going to probably lag a little bit. And I think that's the prudent way to do it. We don't want the trucks ahead of the gas line, so to speak. So we're going to be probably a little bit conservative in bringing these down. And think about it, a lot of the costs are related to this. They just happened in the third quarter. So we'll start seeing some of that run rate come through in the fourth quarter and moving forward.","Aleem Gillani","I think, Ken, if you look at the run rate year-over-year, I think last year our run rate was something like $800 million. This year, our run rate is considerably below that. And I would expect next year, our run rate will decline further.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then my second question, Aleem, just wondering if you can help us understand how the earning asset trends should look from here because period end was, what, $152.5 million versus $153.8 million average. The timing of all the moving parts in the fourth quarter is a little tricky to understand. Then you have some underlying growth. I just wondered if you can give us kind of -- maybe even just a range of how you expect the earning asset base to trend in the fourth quarter?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think with the sales that we announced, you think about that as being about $3 billion coming out of earning assets. So start with that lower level. And I think the answer, Ken, is going to be sort of very pipeline and economy dependent in the very short term. If we can get the economy out of this malaise, you would expect to see earning assets start to climb now from that lower level that we see. But in the very short term, the next quarter or 2, while we are -- while we do have some fairly strong pipeline, it does feel like a lot of clients are being very cautious about adding new debt levels to their balance sheet and it's a bit of a challenge out there. It's a bit of a fight every day as we look to try and service our clients and grow assets that we have from here. I would look for growth. I would look for a higher balance sheet. But just to remember to start from that lower number after the sale this quarter.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're saying that the $3 billion pretty much is the right average to take out of this quarter's number?","Aleem Gillani","I think on average, that's fine. Some of those sales already came out, as I said, early this quarter, some will come out a little bit later in the quarter. But on average, that should be about right.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess more of a conceptual question related to the mortgage business that's obviously doing very, very well right now, but one of the questions that I often get from investors is how confident you all are that you can take costs out of the Mortgage business once that business begins to normalize at some point next year, and how that might affect your thinking on the efficiency ratio.","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I'll take a shot. The expenses related to the Mortgage business sort of don't follow an exact quarter-to-quarter. As I said in my comments, not only sort of what we use, what I'd call the traditional methods, so as you see that decline, you see normal expenses come down and they tend to lag a quarter or 2 depending on how much of the volume is purchased and how much is refinanced. So obviously, it'll lag more for refinanced and less for purchased. But what we're doing is a fairly significant sort of redesign of the channels in the business as we're going through this. One of the real silver linings behind HARP is where it really has afforded us the opportunity to build out our consumer direct channel. And that channel, as a percent of our business a year ago, was pretty small. It's about 10% of our business now and it is a much more efficient part of the structure. So not only sort of do you have the traditional tools, we're also going through a pretty, as I said, a redesign of the channel mix. So I'm actually fairly confident when we come out of this, we'll come out of this with a higher-margin business relative to how we entered this from the changes that we're making now.","William Henry Rogers","Hey, Matt, I'd also add one more point and that is I'd also remind you that over the last little while, we've spent several tens of millions of dollars around the consent order, consulting costs around the independent workload review. And as you look out to next year, I would expect all of those costs to abate, and that'll also provide a nice lift to the overall performance of the Mortgage business.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess just for my follow-up, just a quick question for Aleem. Aleem, what percentage of the mortgage originations this quarter related to HARP?","Aleem Gillani","In total, if you look at our total origination, Matt, it was about sort of 70-30 refi versus purchase. And of the refi, about 30% of the total refi was HARP. So if you work that through, about 20% of our total business this quarter was HARP.","Operator","Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","When you guys gave us the estimates on the core expenses of about $1.5 billion for the quarter, what would your estimate be of the associated environmental cost or OREO cost in that number in this quarter? How would that compare to a more normalized number when we get out of the mess on credit?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think, Matt -- Gerard, if you take a look at that expense slide that we got, 28, in the deck, yes, you get a sense of what the environmental costs have been within that number. And as we said earlier, that run rate is coming down pretty nicely from where it was last year and where it peaked. And I would expect that to continue to come down. If you think about a really normalized number, I mean, back in the day, that line item for us had a run rate of about $200 million annually. I don't think that we'll ever get back to that kind of a number, but it might be reasonable to assume that, that kind of a number from $200 million might double. But even when it doubles, it's 1\/2 of the $800 million we ran at last year.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. The second question was you guys indicated that $400 million of the so-called Chapter 7 type loans that the OCC regulated banks have had to identify this quarter and put into nonperforming, how much of the $400 million -- you mentioned what's performing TDR in your release, but how much of the $400 million has already been reserved for? And if you are required to put the entire $400 million on nonperforming, what type of provision would you have to take to build up that reserve?","Aleem Gillani","I'm not sure I could give you an answer to that one yet. This guidance came out right at the end of the quarter and we were not subject to it, so we're currently doing the analysis to see what the total looks like. But at a higher level, I think given that these are performing loans, you would expect that the reserve against them would be very minimal to nonexistent. And the idea that we would take them and put them into nonperforming may or may not have an impact on provisions. We're still waiting for coordinated guidance across from all the agencies. And obviously, when we hear that, we will take action immediately.","Operator","Our final question today is from Greg Ketron with UBS.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Aleem, a question on mortgage repurchase. If I -- I think I heard this right. You had mentioned that you did see a uptick in requests on performing loans. And if so, how that might affect -- is that included already in the reserve that you've set up or would that change your thinking or approach on the mortgage repurchase reserve?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, Greg. Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear on that. It's not an uptick on the request in performing loans. It's a percent of change. So that, overall, the demands were down. But out of that total decreasing number, the percentage on loans that have never been 120 is going up. So they're less delinquent and they're more recent, and therefore, contain a lower loss content than the demands on previous loans that we were getting. Does that make more sense?","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, yes. I just was thinking in terms of how that might impact or if there is any impact to the reserve that you've established today.","Aleem Gillani","Any impact is positive as these have lower loss content and that was already included in the provision that we took in the quarter. So I think the reserve that we have got now should be sufficient to cover everything that we're required to cover.","Gregory W. Ketron - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe a bigger picture question for you, Bill. We've seen a number of housing data points be very positive, particularly in the Southeast in terms of home prices, housing starts, you name it, it's all been a pretty steady stream of good data. How does that impact SunTrust from a bigger picture standpoint in terms of demand, maybe seeing Florida -- you've had a tremendous backlog in Florida, maybe seeing that speed up. And does that ultimately help lower these credit costs -- if this trajectory continues, does that ultimately help lower the credit costs faster?","William Henry Rogers","I think actually the biggest tie to housing value increase and what it does for us is increasing consumer confidence. I honestly think that's sort of the biggest tie if you can think about sort of where people are coming from, this being their largest asset. When that starts to change, they look at their, sort of as a general comment, they're more deleveraged than they were before. I think this just tries to unlock some of the consumer confidence. We're still more tied to employment than housing values, but that's also seeing some positive trajectory. I mean, take -- use Florida as an example. While still above the national average, the improvement in Florida and unemployment's gone from 10.6 to 8.7. So the largest probably percent of improvement, coupled with housing values, I mean I think it's really a consumer confidence game in terms of the opportunity for us. And we feel it.","Let me just make a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. We've made significant progress in more favorably positioning the bank through -- for the future. That's through specific actions we've taken during the quarter, but really more broadly, through the benefits of some of our strategic operating decisions. We are building a more effective and efficient company, not only through expense savings, but also in the way that we're approaching revenue generation. A significant opportunity exists to leverage the loyalty that we've built, and our team has the tools and training they need to uncover more client needs and further deepen those relationships. And that's not to say that the path ahead is not without its challenges. But there is a high level of intensity across the organization around translating opportunity into results. And I believe we're focusing that energy in areas that can best impact bottom line performance. So with that said, thank you for joining us today and please reach out to our Investor Relations team with any other questions you may have.","Operator","Thank you.

And instructions will be given to you at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host. Mr. Ankur Vyas. Please go ahead.","Ankur Vyas","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to SunTrust's first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topic that we plan to address during our call. The press release, the presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.suntrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Allison Dukes, our Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance.

The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William Rogers","Thanks, Ankur and good morning everyone. I'll begin with an overview of the first quarter which we highlight on the slide 3. Earnings per share for the quarter were $1.29, which represents an 18% increase compared to the prior quarter adjusted earnings per share and a 42% year-over-year increase. Some of this improvement was driven by favorable operating environment given both lower tax rates and higher interest rates. Our strong credit quality improved efficiency were also key contributors for this performance. ","As you've heard me in the past, the culture of continues improvement we've installed across the company is reflected within the results. Our increased discipline of both expenses and returns combined with the actions we took in 2017 are driving improvements in our profitability and ultimately enhancing the earnings power of the franchise. ","Overall, revenue trends are a bit mixed. On the lending side, we continue to have good momentum within the consumer lending at our middle market commercial banking business. This has been offset by reductions within CIB and CRE where our larger clients have strong cash flow and access to capital markets of non-bank alternatives. Pipelines did build throughout the quarter across the CIBs, CRE and commercial but more broadly the lack of commercial loan growth demand just opposed [ph] against the strong economy has been a little counter intuitive. ","As you know, loan growth is not a target we manage to and if we\u2019re unable to deliver profitable loan growth we will have the opportunity to increase capital returns to our owners. Limited loan growth has afforded us the opportunity to keep overall deposit cost control which was a key driver of the seven basis points sequential improvement and our net interest margin. ","On the fee side, mortgage in investment banking did not meet our expectations this quarter mostly driven by market conditions. But our performance in equity and M&A was strong as was our progress in delivering capital markets solutions to non-CIB clients all of which continue to reflect our increasing strategic relevance to clients. The last few weeks of the quarter was strong, and IB pipeline was very healthy but market conditions will determine how much of that is realized in the second quarter or later this year. ","Separate link credit quality continues to be strength for us. Our consistently low charge-off ratio and improved outlook for credit losses across the portfolio including potential hurricane losses drive a two basis points decline in our ALLL ratio. Lastly, our expense management efforts across the company are driving good progress, evidenced by a tangible efficiency ratio of 62.1% which represents a meaningful year-over-year improvement. Overall, we\u2019re off to a good start in 2018 and I believe that our performance can continue to improve throughout the year. ","Finally, for those of you who are already aware, Aleem Gillani will return in a few weeks and Alison succeeded in the CFO at the end of March. Aleem has been a key contributor to our results particularly as CFO over the last seven years. ","We started in these roles together and I\u2019m very grateful to him for his competence, his counsel and his leadership. He helped us getting to where we are today and set us up really well for the future. I think our owners are thankful he was here as well. ","We\u2019re also very fortunate to have Alison Duke as a team mate. Alison is extremely well suited to succeed Aleem given her long and accomplished career here at SunTrust. Alison joined SunTrust in 1997 and has delivered strong business and financial results through multiple rolls and consumer and finance which will give us a unique and multi-faceted perspective in this roll. Alison welcome. And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to you.","Alison Dukes","Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I\u2019d also like to thank Aleem for the guidance and the counsel that he has given me over the past two months since I transitioned into this role. I\u2019ll work hard to ensure the transition is seamless for all of our constituents.","Now moving to slide 4. Our net interest margin improved seven basis points this quarter which surpassed our internal expectations due to lower than expected deposit betas, wider LIBOR alliance spread, net premium amortization and the repricing of certain tax influence. There is improvement in the net interest margin was offset by the change in FTE calculation and fewer days which resulted in $11 million decline in net interest income. ","Looking ahead, the same factors that caused such positive trajectory in our net interest margin this quarter are unlikely to repeat. Accordingly, we expect the net interest margin in the second quarter to increase by 1 to 3 basis points relative to the first quarter largely as a result of the March rate hike. Beyond that, NIM trends will depend on the level of rates and the competitive environment both as it relates to lending spreads and deposit costs. ","Moving to slide 5. Non-interest income decreased by $37 million sequentially largely due to the seasonal decline in commercial real estate related income. Mortgage production was also down compared to the prior quarter and prior year as a result of lower refinancing activity and compressed gain on sale margins both of which have been impacted by higher long-term rates. Some of this decline was offset by $23 million gain related to the revaluation of an equity investment we have in a fintech company. Compared to the prior year, fees were down by $51 million with the majority of the decline driven by debt capital markets where market conditions take some of our plans on the sidelines. As Bill mentioned this was partially offset by the continued strength of our M&A and equity businesses. ","Looking to the next quarter, we expect investment banking income to demonstrate solid sequential growth assuming relatively stable capital market conditions. Finally, we adopted new accounting standards this quarter, that alter which expenses are recorded as a counter revenue for certain fee income line items. As a result, investment banking is higher by roughly $4 million whereas card fees, service charges and other fees are lower by combined $7 million. On a net basis, fee income decreases by approximately $3 million which then resulted in an equivalent $3 million decrease in non-interest expenses. We did not retake prior periods given these changes were not material. ","This brings me to slide 6. Even after the $75 million seasonal increase in employee compensation and benefit costs, expenses were only up by $9 million relative to the fourth quarter's adjusted expenses and down 3% relative to the prior year. This is a reflection of our ongoing efficiency effort in addition to the low average operating losses. Operating losses benefited from a $10 million net legal accrual reversal this quarter as a result of the progression of certain legal matters in addition to below average product losses. Other non-interest expense was lower than the prior quarter and prior year quarter given elevated efficiency related charges, including branch closure and severance costs that were recognized in 2017. ","Lastly, our FDIC premium have been trending downward over the past few quarters as a result of our improved financial position. ","As you can see on slide 7, the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 62.1% which is up relative to the fourth quarter given normal, seasonal patterns in our business but down meaningfully compared to the prior year. This improvement is even more notable when considering the 50-basis point headwind from FTE adjustments. This progress keeps us on track to meet our goal of having a 60% to 61% tangible efficiency ratio this year and a sub-60% efficiency ratio next year. ","Now moving to slide 8. Net charge offs decreased by 8 basis points sequentially. The low level of net charge offs reflects the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I portfolio. Performance we are extremely pleased with that we remain cognizant that there could be both variability and normalization going forward. The [indiscernible] ratio declined by 2 basis points sequentially as a result of continued asset quality improvements including an improved outlook for hurricane related losses. This decline when combined with the low charge-off resulted in a very low provision expense of $28 million. Overall, we expect to operate with a 25 to 35 basis points net charge-off ratio for the rest of the year and if the current asset quality condition is sustained, the ALLL ratio could decline.","Moving to the balance sheet on slide 9, average loans were down 1% sequentially with much of the decline driven by the sale of our insurance premium finance business [indiscernible] in December. Balances were stable compared to the prior year as good growth in our consumer lending and commercial banking businesses continues to be offset by decline in CIB and CRE. ","Looking ahead, our clients remain very optimistic about their prospects as noted in our annual business survey and we believe the tax reform and a generally positive economic backdrop will drive increased investment and growth. Further, our pipeline trends throughout the quarter supports this overall we are well positioned to meet our clients need whether be it lending, capital market or other solutions. ","On the deposit side, average balances were down 1% sequentially mostly due to seasonal turns in our public funds business and are stable year-over-year. As anticipated, our clients have migrated from lower cost deposits to CDs and we would expect this migration to continue as interest rates rise. The limits of loan growth we have seen in the past year combined with our access to low cost funding has enabled us to prudently manage our funding base and therefore more effectively manage overall deposit cost, evidenced by approximately 20% realized interest bearing deposit beta in the first quarter.","We do not consider this to be sustainable but we remain focused on maximizing the value proposition for our clients outside of rate case by meeting more of our clients' needs via strategic investments in talent and technology. Moving to slide 10, which provides an update on our capital position. ","Our estimated Basel III common equity Tier-1 ratio was 9.8% and when applying a 250% risk weight for MSRs as contemplated in the simplifications MPR. Our CET-1 ratio would be 9. 7%. Those ratios are up slightly relative to the prior quarter due to strong growth in retained earnings and a slight decline in risk weighted assets. ","As a reminder, we redeemed 450 million of higher cost preferred stock in March. We submitted our 2018 capital plan earlier this month and we look forward to sharing our results with you in late June. At a high level, our strong capital position specially in the context of our risk profile combined with additional capital stack optimization should allow us to continue to increase payouts to our earners. ","Now moving to the segment overview, we\u2019ll begin with the consumer segment on slide 11 where we continue to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. One of our primary strategic priorities has been to improve our balance sheet diversity and enhance return. Thus far we feel good about the results we \u2018ve delivered, the investments we\u2019ve made across consumer lending, especially in life stream and partnership with Green Sky and credit card are driving growth and improvements in our risk adjusted returns. Some of this growth has been offset by the continued declines in home equity and our intentional pull back from certain lower return portfolios like auto. ","We also expanded life stream\u2019s home improvement terms and announced a new lending partnership with [indiscernible] which provides point of sale financing for HVIC system. While this won't be a significant driver of loan growth in the context of the overall company, it is a reflection of a strong partnership capabilities and the trends towards purpose based, point of sale, digital financing. ","We continue to evaluate other opportunities like this to leverage our capabilities and capitalize on changes in consumer preferences and behaviors. While we're seeing strong growth in net interest income within consumers, fees have been structured by mortgage production. As I mentioned earlier, refinancing volumes continue to decline given the rising rate environment. Gain on sale margins have also been compressed due to the increased competitions from lenders. On the other hand, our wealth management business is demonstrating positive underlying trends with AUM up 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. A reflection that our value proposition for our targeted client segments is resonating in the marketplace, driving growth in new clients and greater wallet share with existing clients. While total revenue growth in consumers does not reflect our potential, the actions we took in 2017 to improve efficiency drove a 20% year-over-year improvement in PPNR. Our branch health is down by 6%, which is largely enabled by improving digital adoption rate. ","We've also made significant strides in streamlining operations. This quarter specifically, we completed a significant transformation in private wealth, which leverages robotics and artificial intelligence to automate many of our back and middle office functions. These are just the few examples of the work that's being done to improve efficiencies and ultimately help us achieve our profitability target. ","Importantly, we're making strides in improving efficiency while still investing in technology and revenue growth assumption -- revenue growth opportunities. This quarter specifically, we introduced a new digital mortgage application, which we refer to as Smart Guide providing for significantly better client experience that is competitive with the other online mortgage lenders. We're now one year into our journey of creating a more integrated consumer business and are very pleased with the initial results. We've made good strides in appropriately wiring the ecosystem so that the right teammate is delivering the right solution at the right time. This not only enhances the client experience it also generates operational efficiencies. There is still more work to do, but we've got a great team in place and we have a clear strategy and we're in some of the highest growth markets in the country. ","Moving to wholesale banking on slide 12. Lending trends have not changed much relative to last year, commercial banking trends remain positive, somewhat bolstered by expansion into our new markets at Texas, Ohio. This continues to be offset by declines in CIB and CRE where several factors including strong cash flows and non-bank alternatives have contributed to reductions in loan balances. In addition, some of the declines have been intentional, as more pricing and structures within CIB and CRE do not meet our return hurdles or underwriting standards. That being said, the decline in loan balance also limits our need to pay off for high class, high data deposits especially where we do not have a broader relationship. ","As mentioned previously, commercial real estate related income was down sequentially due to seasonal trends. This is partially offset by capital markets which Increased on a sequential basis but was lower than our expectations. Market conditions can and do drive some quarterly variability in this quarter which was certainly true this quarter, especially in parts of our debt capital markets business. That being said, we continue to be encouraged by the momentum we're having with our non-CIB clients. We achieved 50% year-over-year growth in capital markets revenue from our commercial banking, CRE and private wealth clients with most of the growth coming from M&A and equity. We continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this space given our full set of capabilities and our unique one team approach.","Like consumer, wholesale has maintained its strong efficiency levels while investing in the business. This quarter specifically, we completed the transition to our new cloud-based loan origination system. We also expanded the scope and capabilities of our ageing services vertical to better capture the significant opportunity we have to support this industry given our capability set and our geographic footprint. We\u2019re also delivering on our progress. ","We now have 100 corporate and commercial plans that has signed up for a momentum [on our] program which aids to help companies acquit their employees with the tools they need for financial success. The program provides over 100 simple turnkey tools with resources to help employees begin, sustain and track their progress towards financial confidence. ","And finally, we\u2019re benefitted from a benign credit environment, wholesale has provisions benefit this quarter which was in part driven by our improved outlook for hurricane losses but more so by a continued strong credit performance across the entire portfolio. Big picture while market conditions can and do create quarterly variability, we remain optimistic about the growth opportunities we have in whole if we bring our differentiated business model to clients in new and existing markets. ","Now let me turn the call back to Bill. ","William Rogers ","Thanks Alison. To conclude, I\u2019ll point to slide 13 which highlights how our performance this quarter aligns with our investment theses. We strongly believe in the importance of diversification and this quarter\u2019s performance illustrates why diversity is so important. From an area of lending, I\u2019ve not picked up yet but others like commercial banking and consumer lending were strong. Similarly, higher rates negatively impacted our mortgage business but positively impacted the value of our core deposit franchise. Because of this balance, we\u2019ve been able to reduce volatility and improve performance. ","Across the entire company, we remain highly focused on making the right investments to day which positions us to meet more client needs than drive incremental growth in the future. Alison already talked about some opportunities we took in the first quarter to expand consumer lending and our ageing services vertical. There are just two examples of investments we\u2019re making to meet client needs and capital on key long-term trends. ","While revenue growth was somewhat needed this quarter, it's important to recognize the significant progress we\u2019re making in improving the underlying financial performance of the company. Our net interest margin is up by 17 basis points year-over-year, a large part of that is attributable to the improving rate environment but we\u2019ve also benefitted from our broader balance sheet optimization efforts. ","Our tangible efficiency ratio improved by 250 basis points year-over-year in part due to actions we took in 2017. Our return on tangible common equity was just shy of 16% this quarter, this was clearly a reflection of a lower tax rate but it\u2019s also due years of work on balance sheet optimization improvements and efficiency and better asset quality. Each of the components is a key driver of the 42% improvement in our bond line results. ","Now before I conclude, I want to make you aware of the current matter. In conjunction with law enforcement, we discovered that a former employee while employed at SunTrust may have attempted to print information on approximately 1.5 million clients and share this information with a criminal third party. We believe this information included names and account balances but it did not include personally identifiable information such as social security numbers, account numbers and users' IDs, passwords or driver\u2019s license numbers. We and third parties have done forensic analysis on these accounts and we have not identify significant fraudulent activity regarding the effect of the accounts. ","All that said, we're guided by a purpose of lighting the way to financial wellbeing and this applies to clients and formation security as well. So, for this reason, we're going to offer a broad set of ongoing identity protection services took all of our clients free of charge not just us potentially impacted. Given the increased performance and importance of information security and our client first principle, I was convinced that this comprehensive and proactive approach was the right decision. There will be modest cost for this and other investments in clients' financial confidence but we expect to be able to absorb those in our normal course of business. ","More broadly, I remain optimistic about our company's future, both in 2018 and beyond. We'll continue to invest in our franchise both people and technology all while generating efficiencies and ensuring a strong risk management foundation. Our first quarter performance was a good start for 2018 and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year. ","So, with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur. ","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Bill. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I'd like to ask the participant to please limit yourself to one primary question and one follow up so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Vivek [indiscernible] with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. Bill, I have a question for you based on the announcement you\u2019ve just made. Can you give us a little bit more color on the timing when you found out and how long you observed this lack of fraud losses?","William Rogers","Sure. Thanks, good morning. We began our all internal investigation and through that process, approximately 6 to 8 weeks ago, we discovered that a former employee attempted to download client information. We engage experts, we conducted a full review. And we believe until late last week that the information did not leave SunTrust. Late last week, we received new information and learned that there was a possibility of external exposure of information. And once I learnt there was even a possibility of external exposure that triggered my decision to disclose this to clients and owners. Just a couple of things to make sure that I clarify, we've not identified significant fraudulent activity in these accounts. In fact, our [indiscernible] actually for the first quarter were lower than they've been relative to recent past. And also, as I said, the information did not include personally identifiable information. ","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So, given that it didn't include this personally identifiable information and you're not expecting a material financial impact. That that might have conclude that Allison's comment earlier about your efficiency ratio guidance. You're still sticking by and you expect that to kept there?","William Rogers","Yeah, I mean as you said, it did not include personally identifiable information if you went through a legal lens or materiality lens you can convince yourself not to disclose. That just wasn't an option for us. That's not the standard that I hold myself to. And knowing that there was even a possibility we decided to disclose. As I said before, the cost of this is modest, this is nothing to do with the efficiency ratio and the guidance that we\u2019re giving and in that sense we\u2019re actually more confident than that guidance. this was really about client care. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","John McDonald ","Hey good morning. I was wondering in terms of capital levels, do any of the new regulatory proposals or commentary from the said official's effect how you think about the minimum capital level that you\u2019ll need to run out overtime or is the mix of your distributions of excess capital between dividends and buybacks. ","William Rogers","Yeah, I mean we\u2019re still processing through all that but right that really doesn\u2019t change the way that we\u2019ve used sort of 321 [ph]. I mean I think we\u2019ve sort of said something with an [eight handles]. I don\u2019t think anything changes our ability to achieve and sustain that kind of level for the mix of our company. And then as it relates to the distribution, you know we said before, we said about the higher end of the dividend range, that doesn\u2019t mean the said [ph] is not a little bit of room and so if we\u2019re going to get to that, it's got to be some combination of buyback.","John McDonald ","Okay, and then just quick follow up for Alison, nice improvement in expenses this quarter, does that first quarter expense level pull through as a starting point for the second quarter. I know you have a legal gain other than that whether there are any other elements of first quarter expense that wasn\u2019t sustainable should we think of that as a jumping off point?","Alison Dukes","You know we really don\u2019t manage to expenses and there is a decent amount of noise and puts and takes in any quarter just given the seasonality and some of the non-recurring items like you just mentioned. But the legal reserve is what I would guide you to is our efficiency ratio guidance that was going to land between 50 and 61% this year. obviously, revenue is a big important factor in that equation as well and so we\u2019re really managing to an efficiency ratio that comes in sub 61%. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Betsy Graseck","Could we talk a little bit about the NIM and the rate sensitivity? I know you\u2019ve been taking down your C&I swap position, could you just update us on how much is left if any and what the sensitivity looks like at this stage?","Alison Dukes","Sure. I mean if we\u2019re going to talk about NIM sensitivity and kind of let me start there, I think you\u2019re kind of at two different places there. so, let's start with NIM and just where we are at this quarter kind of level start relative to last quarter. So, at primary drivers as we mentioned in terms of our seven-basis points improvement where low betas 20% realized data in the in the first quarter. LIBOR [indiscernible], lower premium amortization and then contractual repricing of tax [indiscernible] and just continuing to progress there. Those are factors that are not likely to repeat, so as we think about our NIM improvement in the second quarter it's not going to match a seven-basis points quarter-over-quarter increase. And also keep in mind data comp differences between first quarter and second quarter. So, as we think about where we guide to and what\u2019s the next quarter looks like it's probably something in the 1 to 3 basis point benefit category and that\u2019s really largely going to be driven by the march rate high hike. ","Betsy Graseck","So, I just wanted to make sure I understood on the swap positions that you have had that have been producing the asset sensitivity in a low rate environment. Do you still have that -- how much is left on that?","Alison Dukes","And so, our swap position -- remember swaps are really has a tool for to manage our interest rate risk and we're not going to use them any differently than that. And as we think about our asset sensitivity and where we want to be. We're in the 1.5% to 2.5% context that\u2019s what we are continuing to managed to. Our swap both has declined as you know and that's through a combination of early terminations and just maturities. And we're somewhere around about $12 billion in notional amount on the swap book right now. And we'll use that to continue to manage to that asset sensitivity range.","Unidentified Analyst","And no plans to take that down materially from here?","Alison Dukes","No. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. ","Matthew O'Connor","I was just wondering from a very high-level point of view. We have seen the economy pickup. And when we look across not just your bank but a number of the banks out there. You're not seeing a pickup in loan growth which I think has been discussed and tracked for a couple of quarters now. But a lot of the fee categories were sluggish as well and obviously the outlook for investment banking is for a lot better in 2Q. And kind of any one of the categories I guess you could explain, but just when you take them together, it's a little hard to reconcile your broad-based company in terms of your business mix, geographies you're in or stronger geographies. You're just not seeing kind of the pickup in growth throughout maybe the volume side of things. Again, it's not just you, but I'm little curious just from a high-level point of view like why we aren't seeing more business activity in this economy at the banks and your bank. ","William Rogers","So, I think It's important to bifurcate that a bit and try to dissect sort of what's core and what's market driven and trying to think about it. Because I think we're all trying to answer the question that you've asked or relative to the economy. If you think just like a SunTrust specifically if you think commercial banking is more of reflective of sort of a core part of the business more reflective of the markets that we serve and the opportunity that we have. And if you just use lending as the commercial part, that was up nice over 3% year-over-year and good momentum and good pipelines. And as I also noted earlier and really good fee activity coming from that business as well. So, if you use that as a parameter of the health of the business and the reflection of the economy, that's a pretty good signal. ","Similarly for us consumer banking lending also up nicely up over 5% most areas that we look at, look at credit card utilization, look at live stream, look at the things that we do within our franchise related to consumer lending and that reflects positively on what's going on, that's just opposed against things that we see in paydowns like C&I which I think are more market and outside general economic of the geography side. ","If we go to investment banking which you're asked about. I mean most of that was syndicated finance sort of was off to a pretty slow start this quarter I think for us and everybody else. M&A was really -- we had a really good month average fees were up; M&A fees were up. As Allison also mentioned our entr\u00e9e into the non-CIB clients was up a healthy 50% and in the last six weeks of the quarter, we\u2019re a lot stronger. And pipelines continue to be good in almost all areas of both investment banking and even the lending side. So, I do agree there is some countervailing forces but if you bifurcate it a little bit and try to sort of grind down in the sort of what are the key correlations to normal kind of business activities, I think those numbers actually look pretty good. ","Matthew O'Connor","Okay. And then just some more related I mean you showed really good flexibility to bring down the cost this quarter, maybe given some of the weakness in fees and obviously you reiterated the efficiency targets for this year, but if there is continued sluggishness in some of these revenues, do you still have the expense flexibility that you showed this quarter or going forward?","William Rogers","I do think you pointed out and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s becoming more evident for us, it's not only do we have the intensity around the expense side, we\u2019ve got good plans and good focus and then we\u2019re also showing the requisite amount of flexibility. This flexibility always isn\u2019t quarter-to-quarter but it's certainly year-over-year as we think about that and as we manage doing efficiency ratio. I mean clearly, we\u2019re more confident in our guidance of this quarter you know sort of where we came out and feel positive about that flexibility and capability. And I think as an indicator of our ability to be more resilient to situations both good and bad. I mean we\u2019ll see some more revenue growth and we\u2019ll have the ability to respond to that as well.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Marlin Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. ","Marlin Mosby","Thanks. Bill a part of this revenue growth I think is that you still have this focus on balance sheet optimization and as you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re trying here to see the returns go higher. You\u2019re seeing the operating leverage from what you\u2019re being able to accomplish. One, are we kind of only getting through that point where we\u2019re going to start to see those core revenues start to come through and then two, the last stage of balance sheet optimization has to be the return of capital to shareholders. So is there a commitment to finalize that process and get the excess capital off your back to be able to fully optimize because if you\u2019re going to get the eventual [indiscernible], you really have to get the capital back to finish the process. ","William Rogers","You know the optimization process -- we\u2019re sort -- latter part of our optimization we think about our balance sheet we still have opportunities to grow consumers there is proportionately relative to where we are and those kinds of things. But the point you made is not necessarily related to optimization but it is related to return and we are focused on as you know we don\u2019t guide towards and we don\u2019t compensate towards loan growth, that\u2019s not our sort of core parameter we look at returns and are we giving the right returns and in this environment there have been some opportunities that we just didn\u2019t think had their requisite returns and we didn\u2019t feel like we needed to lean in with the loan side of that. I don\u2019t know if that is much an optimization issue as it is just the way we run our business and the way we think about returns overall. ","That being said, you also made the point on the commitment to return to shareholders and to get down to what we see as a more optimal capital. I think I feel confident that we'll be able to continue as one of our core tenants of our strategy to increase our return to shareholders. But given the CCAR process that is always going to be [star step] process. I think the [star step] will continue down, I think that will be positive. I think we'll be making strides towards achieving that goal. We are reflecting the asset growth and that thought process. So that has been part of our thought process. But it will go on its own natural pace. ","Marlin Mosby","And then kind of the part of that, Bank of America this quarter actually stopped reporting mortgage banking separately. And actually, because they're putting more and more on the balance sheet. Has the business just evolved to a point where their all securitization model and the servicing model that you are still kind of committed to is actually kind of changed over to creating because you're not creating as much loan growth elsewhere putting more of this on to the balance sheet. And have you kind of thought about a more significant transition in that way.","William Rogers","I think Bank of America's position is pretty dramatically different than maybe the rest of the community and which is fine if that\u2019s their strategy. I think the more mortgage business continues to be an important part of how we serve our client's needs and how we make sure that we have a comprehensive way to approach them. Our mix of sort of what we put on the balance sheet from a jumbo standpoint. I think we're sort of in that same kind of mode. We're not making a dramatic shift in that process. I think our relative in terms of back of the balance optimization comment are relative exposure of mortgage on the balance sheet. We are sort of in that range. We're not let him to disproportionally grow that part but also continue to create the opportunity to serve our clients. This is a quarter when mortgages rates are up and mortgages are down and you feel less doing about being in the mortgage business but there are plenty of quarters where you feel great about it and important part is to serve the clients and the how about products and the capability and an efficient way of serving this important need for our clients. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. ","Kenneth Usdin","On the consumer loan side. There is always a chance that there is some seasonality. The indirect [ph] as you said was down, and I'm just wondering how much push and pulls there is, I know you're not imaging to loans. But in terms of where you stand on willingness and ability to lend more in that consumer indirect space? And just in demand that you're seeing in terms of what kind of growth you can see at out of that side of the business. Thanks. ","William Rogers","Yeah, Ken a little bit of your question broke up so if I don't get it all make sure you have some more. As it relates to the two categories. As it relates to consumer lending as a whole, we have a lot of capacity and opportunity in that bucket. I mean we feel good about that, we feel we've had good growth characteristics, we've got a good production engine in place. It's efficient it's client responsive, we've invested in making sure that we've got the right digital response, we've got the right efficiency client experience. So, it's sort of a broader comment, we feel really good about the consumer lending business and our position in that and our capability. Now as it relates to indirect specifically you know that going to have a lot to do with the balance sheet optimizations question earlier. Right now, on the auto side we hope the returns are commensurate with what we want to achieve in the company. Yeah, you seen some of the significant increase in our royalty fee, we want to make sure we sort of stay at that high levels. So that part probably is not reflective as much about the opportunity as it is about our choice. So that\u2019s an area where again we feel like we\u2019ve got the right amount of exposure and we\u2019re going to calibrate relative to return. ","Kenneth Usdin","And then on the second side of consumer, I think there has been an expectation that we\u2019d start to see some of that newer business normalizing credit but it's not, it's looking quite great and just so as far as an outlook on just broadly speaking which continues to be amazing and all the metrics anything popping in there, [indiscernible] but could you just give us that general thought for just credit and the outlook and anything changing underneath the surface?","William Rogers","Just the general comment you know there is not one thing that we see popping its head up. We\u2019re bankers and we\u2019re going to be cautious and we\u2019re bankers and we\u2019re in low charge-offs land and we\u2019re going to be cautious and we\u2019re constantly going to be looking for the brown shoes, maybe instead of green shoes. But today there isn\u2019t one thing that I would point to and say gosh this is an indication that we\u2019re making a dramatic shift. I don\u2019t know if you have anything to add to that. ","Alison Dukes","I would incur with all of that, I would just reiterate that our net charge-off experience this quarter with particularly low. I think it surprised us to some extent how low it was. We would continue to expect net charge offs to be in the 25 to 35 basis point range for the year. But [indiscernible] said, there is nothing we\u2019re particularly concerned about. We\u2019re really just pointing more towards a normalized charge-off environment that we would expect in this economic context.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.","Saul Martinez ","In the past I think you guys have mentioned that your expectations were for IDCs to grow in 2018 versus 2017, recognizing that your comments on the pipeline and better result in the second quarter. Is that still the expectation sitting today?","William Rogers","Still is, I mean we\u2019ve had you know we\u2019ve had a decade long and continued growth in that business given the investments we\u2019ve made and you know equally important the depth and breadth of where our fees come from now is just like the rest of our balance sheet in a more diversified and I think has lower volatility over time. You know if I have to get some small caveat, there are market conditions and assuming that market conditions stay you now relatively that you\u2019re relatively in this range. I feel good that we can continue to have the same progress. And again, everything I have seen on the last several weeks of the quarter and most importantly the pipeline and the talent and the capability of the conversations and the breadth and depth of what we do need to continue to be confident in the growth line of that business. ","Saul Martinez ","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Moving on the loan growth, last quarter you mentioned prepayments were elevated and that was the headwind, this quarter can you just comment on prepays versus last quarter was it notably different was it at similar level? I may have missed it in the opening remarks. If you did talk about that? And sort of as an adjunct to that, can you just comment on utilization rates whether they're moving upwards or kind of still flat line there?","William Rogers","Yeah pay downs are slightly lower, so we'll do that as a positive when you think about the formula. But there is slightly lower often still an elevated level relative to sort of history. But both the utilization are up. And this quarter was one of the lowest quarters we've experienced and overall utilization. We had increased number of revolvers, so we had increased exposure and increased opportunity, but utilization was low this quarter. ","Saul Martinez ","And what do you think that was?","William Rogers","I think it's sort to back to the other issues we've talked about. I think clients in particular at that larger side have a lot cash. And if you have a lot of cash and you're not deploying it you're going to pay down debt. I'm still optimistic about the deployment. I think it takes time to get the advent of tax reform through and get it to all the cylinders to be popping at the same time. But I think it's not more complicated than there is cash. And the first-place cash is to revolve. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. ","Erika Najarian","Recognizing that the first quarter seems to be a high watermark for the efficiency ratio. I'm wondering if you could walk us through beyond the second quarter. The revenue assumptions, the major revenue assumptions that you have baked in, in terms of feeding into the 60% to 61% tangible efficiency goal. You answered the questions on investment banking, but I'm wondering if you could share with us beyond the second quarter expectations for net interest income and major assumptions underneath that. And also, for mortgage production income.","William Rogers","Sure. I mean just as a general comment what I'm sort of doing quarter-by-quarter guidance, where we sit in the first quarter, we're going to see revenues trending down and expenses trending down. There are going to be more sophisticated than that but that's what we see in the pipeline and the momentum that we see on the revenue side and some of the seasonality impacts and things like mortgage which you just discussed, pipelines and investment banking et cetera would have on that side, on the revenue side. And then the expense side, you've got onetime things in the first quarter. They come off and we expect that to continue to go down. So, getting from where we are now to 60 to 61 on average for the year that would necessarily be the trend. ","Erika Najarian","From what you know now about the data breach issue. Do you not anticipate having to significantly improve some security or your systems that would disallow single employee to be able to access that much data at one point?","William Rogers","Yeah just a couple of clarifying comments if I may. This was not a data breach. So, I want to make sure from a language standpoint that we are clear. The second part of your question that was is a great question. And that clearly that employee was not authorized to get that level of information, we\u2019re clearly are reviewing systems and capabilities but it's not a disproportionate level of investment, this is something we\u2019ve been investing in for a long time, we\u2019re going to continue invest in, this is unfortunately the world we live in and it will continue to have a high level of investment that we have in the past. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","John Pancari ","On the expense side on the consumer bank, can you remind us of the magnitude of the targeted reduction in the efficiency ratio that Mark [indiscernible] is working on their in the consumer business. I believe you had indicated about 500 basis points of targeted reduction in that efficiency and also over what period are you looking to achieve that? Thanks.","William Rogers","Yeah, I mean that\u2019s over a longer period of time and as you know I mean what we do is sort of a reminder as we look at all of our businesses we\u2019ve set an efficiency target for all of those stump [ph] lines of business that\u2019s were weighted to be in the top quartile in terms of their performance. So, if we take consumer and if you sort of bifurcate our opportunities, you see most of the opportunity on the efficiency side comes from consumers. So, the math is not that complicated and that is half of our business. And then you know Mark\u2019s got a good plan and that, that\u2019s related to in addition to the branch network and things we talked about the process automation, organizational redesign, third party optimization. We\u2019ve got efforts in this core consumer side, private wealth management, robotics and restructuring the support model, strategic vendor better management. We\u2019ve talked a lot about the opportunities and mortgage being part consumers. So, it\u2019s a multi-faceted plan, it\u2019s a plan that\u2019s over time it is incorporated into our overall guidance obviously for the year and ongoing and the team is -- they\u2019re executing well in some of that is evidenced this quarter and they\u2019re executing with a lot of intensity.","John Pancari ","Okay. And then related to that, how much of that targeted savings is coming from revenue versus expenses?","William Rogers","Well I\u2019d say it\u2019s a balance and in terms of that and that\u2019s why we talk about efficiency ratio, we\u2019ll have some of the flexibility, if you can sort of break it up if you can see on the consumer lending side. We\u2019re making some good investments there and we\u2019re making -- we are leaning towards that, that will have a revenue of push in an extent to pull later in the process and then on the mortgage side we\u2019re doing a lot of optimization relative to where that business is and where high rates are. So, the answer is that by sub-LOV and each one have had a little bit of a different strategy related to risk related to the revenue and expense standpoint. But the answer for the total segment is its balanced.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Michael Mayo ","You\u2019ve had seven years of continuing improvement and efficiency and I\u2019m still wondering about the trade-off between the level of investing and your efficiency ratio and I know it\u2019s not an easy question that you have to ask. But do you have the right level of investments, how much do you invest each year, how much of that in technology? And I still go back to 1985, when you had an efficiency ratio of 60%. So maybe if you get to that 60% ratio sooner than what you forecast or your goal for this year, you have lower deposit insurance in the second half as you can quantify that. And then lastly, in the timing differences your branches are down, your ATMs are down your employees are down year-over-year but some of your comp and occupancy expenses were up year-over-year. So, several questions in one there, but just really looking more color on efficiency?","William Rogers","Sure. I want to remember the start of the question. 7 years of continued improvement efficiency. So, let's start there and again I think we'll have a 8th year and 9th year. So, we're committed to continue to make that improvement. But the whole reason that we've been driving towards the concept of efficiency ratio and improvement overtime is the exact other part of your question is we still think we have a lot of opportunities to invest. And you've seen those areas that we've invested in and where we've received really good results. And if you think probably the largest in terms of investment and look at investment banking. I mean we continue to invest we do that in area that's got to really strong I would say top quartile efficiency ratio. So, we think we're sort of at the longer end of that curve in terms of investing versus pay off. And now we sort of have a consistent model that that works. ","From the technology side, we're significant investors in technology, look at some of the leading things we're doing with [indiscernible] and things we're doing in treasury payment [indiscernible] transaction monetization. I mean so the what we just announced on the mortgage front end. that's part of what we do and it's really recognized in our mobile adoption. We have some of the highest mobile adoption of banks that are similar to ourselves. So not only are we investing I think we've got good evidence that there is results of that investment in technology. ","As it relates to the comp part of your equation. It's also another reason that we talked about the efficiency ratio. So, while we're somewhat down total FTEs, some of that we've been adding is in the more highly skilled areas. And what we think overtime will be some more of the higher return areas. So, there is a little bit of trade off. And if there is a little bit of a lag effect. And we'll see some of that lag effect and that will be reflected in that efficiency ratio as we go forward. Did I hit all of them Mike?","Michael Mayo ","I think so. let me get back to the second question. So, you're harvesting a little bit more in investing and investment banking. And you sprinkle [indiscernible] for your CEO Letter in the annual report. But then results did seem to comment a little bit less than expected here. But you still expect there is revenue fee up this year. So, I'm just trying to kind understand where you are in the investment banking progression. I guess fixed income was weak it's in the large national banks too. Are you still as confident or are you just lower expectations little here?","William Rogers","No, I'm not lowering expectations at all. I mean I still have the same level of confidence. It's not a quarter-by-quarter business as you well know. It's something you have to look at it over the long term. And I think our long-term track record a decade plus I think speaks for itself. The talent that we've had, we just added a lot of 10-year pins to the leadership and SunTrust office in Humphry. So, this is the business that we\u2019ve got a lot of consistency in the strategic element of expanding that across the broader part of our franchise, actually just gives me more confidence. it is not totally market dependent, we\u2019re building essentially additional verticals and in the success of that business. So, I\u2019m not backing up my confidence from eight weeks of less than exciting performance to start the year.","Michael Mayo ","All right [indiscernible] stake and house at the start of the second quarter for the investment banking. ","William Rogers","We\u2019re off to a good start, that the second quarter is off to a better start. Again, I\u2019m also not going to project the whole quarter based on the first couple of weeks of the second quarter but we\u2019re off to a good start and the pipelines -- most importantly, the pipeline is really good. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. ","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, I think you guys touched upon your deposit beta this quarter if I heard Alison correctly was about 20%? Can you share with us if you break it out by customer base and the retail consumer beta versus your wealth management beta and your commercial deposit betas? And second to that question when do you think you\u2019re going to get to the open-end level of where those numbers could get to in terms of being at their maximum level. ","Alison Dukes","So, in terms of breaking out the 20% deposit beta, it's in line with what you would expect our consumer deposit betas are low and remain low. Our wholesale and corporate deposit betas and our private wealth client deposit data is on the higher side and they\u2019ve remained on the higher side and they\u2019ve been pretty consistent over the last few quarters. That said, they are lower than I think we would expect and then in some respect lower than the industry would expect. Your question of when do we get to that absolute height there, is an answer of it really depends. It depends on the level of loan growth we received because we have the opportunity to stay disciplined and manage our rates paid in the absence of loan growth. It depends on the absolute level of rates that are out there and it also depends on the number of rate hike and how quickly we see those rates hikes. So, it's taking all of that in context. I think the answer is it depends but we would expect them to go higher perhaps somewhere in the context of 25 to 35% for 2018.","Gerard Cassidy","Yeah, just really quickly. I know credit is very strong for your folks as for the industry, we don\u2019t expect it to be an issue this year. But could you just share with us, I know you are coming off a very low base but on slide 17 you do show that the commercial real estate non-performing loans rose again. Any color there, is it a one-off or just maybe some color there?","William Rogers","Yeah, that\u2019s really both, one is working up a low base, so when you have one of two situations, it sorts of distorts it as a percentage, but that\u2019s like one off related to some of things we\u2019ve seen in the retail segment of real estate. ","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. ","William Rogers","Doesn\u2019t have a lot of exposure for us but that was little bit of a one-off.","Ankur Vyas","This concludes our call. Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the IR department. ","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]. I'd like to inform you that the call is being recorded and if you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the call over to Ankur Vyas, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, you may begin. ","Ankur Vyas","Thank you, Iris. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Thank you for joining us. In addition to today's press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules can be accessed at investors.SunTrust.com. With me today, among other members of our executive management team are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer. ","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings which are available on our website.

I'll begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I'll turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results at the business segment level. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long term strategy and overall investment thesis. We reported $0.91 of earnings this quarter which represents a 2% increase relative to the core earnings of the prior quarter and prior year. Overall, I'd characterize this as a good quarter.","Revenue growth in particular was very strong, up 8% compared to the prior year and reflects the ongoing investments we've made in each of our businesses over the past few years. Noninterest income was up 10% year-over-year, driven by strength in mortgage and another record quarter in capital markets which is clear that we're increasingly becoming a preferred strategic advisor to our clients. Net interest income was up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Our businesses remain focused on managing the balance sheet in a strategic, profitable manner which has allowed us to overcome much of the margin compression. The $1 billion auto loan sale we executed this quarter is fully consistent with our commitment to meet our clients' needs, while also optimizing the balance sheet by staying disciplined on returns.","Overall, our strong revenue growth helped offset the increase in expenses and keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving the efficiency of the Company, evidenced by the fact that our year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to all of 2015. Now with that said, absolute expenses this quarter came in higher than I feel is acceptable. Some of this was related to revenue and some were anticipated increases, but overall, we did not fully demonstrate the strong expense control I think we're capable of. Asset quality improved as we made further progress in working through certain energy credits. ","The net charge-off ratio declined to 35 basis points. Non-performing loans were stable and provision expense declined. I consider our overall asset quality to be strong which is a testament to the solid economic conditions in our markets and businesses and our continued underwriting discipline. Our capital position was stable with our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio estimated to be 9.7% on a Basel III fully phased-in basis. Tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Additionally, we began executing our 2016 capital plan this quarter, of which we will return 23% more capital to our shareholders relative to the previous plan.","In addition, I'll highlight the acquisition of Pillar Financial which was announced yesterday. As you've heard us say in the past, the types of acquisitions we're focused on today are businesses that complement and leverage our existing capabilities, while also being accretive to our return profile. Pillar Financial does just that. They're a multi-family agency lending and servicing Company that holds Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA licenses with an originate to distribute focus. This acquisition broadens the capabilities of our commercial real estate team, increases the velocity of our balance sheet and allows us to meet more of our client's permanent financing needs.","Lastly, I'm pleased to provide an update regarding our onUp Movement which is focused on sparking a conversation with all Americans about money and giving them the tools and resources they need to move from financial stress to financial confidence. We formally launched this movement with our Super Bowl ad back in February. But it's truly is an extension of our Company's purpose of lighting the way to financial well-being. I'm pleased to announce that over 700,000 people have joined the movement, by taking a first step towards financial confidence. This is just one symbol of our commitment to put our purpose in action every day.","So with that, let me turn it over to Aleem. ","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. Let's move on to slide 4 and take a look at our net interest margin. You can see that it declined by 3 basis points compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to the continued low interest rate environment which negatively impacted both residential mortgage loan and security yields. In addition, the full effect of last quarter's subordinated debt issuance, along with slightly higher deposit costs, also contributed to the sequential decline.","These negative impacts were partially offset by an increase in LIBOR and further favorable mix shift in our loan portfolio, as a result of our continuous balance sheet optimization efforts. Net interest income increased $19 million from prior quarter, as solid 1% average loan and deposit growth counteracted the reduction in NIM. Assuming a static rate environment, we expect the net interest margin to decline 2 to 3 basis points next quarter. We're continuing to carefully manage the duration of the balance sheet, given the prolonged low rate environment, while also being cognizant of controlling interest rate risk. ","Moving on to slide 5, you can see that despite the recognition of $44 million in net asset-related gains last quarter, noninterest income declined only $9 million, due to strength in both capital markets and mortgage. Capital markets-related income had another record quarter, increasing $52 million sequentially and exhibiting strong returns on the strategic investments we have made in this business over many years. In addition, as a reminder, we had $17 million in CVA-related charges last quarter which suppressed the income.","Mortgage production income increased $7 million from an already strong second quarter, benefiting from increases in both purchase and refinancing activity. As a reminder, we're now fully implementing our enhanced posting order process and expect to see a reduction in service charges of approximately $10 million per quarter starting now. ","Moving on to expenses on slide 6, noninterest expense increased $64 million relative to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher regulatory and compliance-related costs, higher costs associated with increased revenue and business activity and increased net occupancy expenses. In terms of the specific expense categories, outside processing and software costs increased $23 million sequentially, primarily due to increased technology investments, higher regulatory-related costs, higher levels of business activity and normal quarterly variability.","Net occupancy expense increased from the prior quarter due to a $6 million discrete benefit in the second quarter and a reduction in amortized gains from prior sale leaseback transactions. Over time, these amortized gains will further dissipate. However, we will be able to offset most of this with a more efficient branch network, resulting in net occupancy costs that are generally stable from here on. Lastly, the improved levels of revenue and business activity resulted in increased incentive compensation and also partially impacted the growth in outside processing, as I noted earlier.","In comparison to the third quarter of last year, noninterest expense was up 11%, not only due to the same reasons as the sequential increase, but also due to roughly $30 million of discrete mortgage-related recoveries and roughly $30 million of lower incentive and benefit costs in the prior year. Overall, while a portion of the expense growth this quarter was related to revenue and a portion was anticipated increases, we do not view the absolute level of expenses we reported this quarter to be our new run rate and we will continue to work diligently to improve our execution and effectiveness. ","On slide 7, as we had discussed last quarter, the tangible efficiency ratio increased and was 62.5% for the third quarter. Year-to-date, the tangible efficiency ratio is 61.6%, 100 basis points better than the full year 2015 and we're well on track to meet our 2016 commitment. Going forward, we've continue to remain focused on continuous improvement towards achieving our long term goal of a sub-60% efficiency ratio. ","Moving on to slide 8, asset quality trends were generally similar to previous quarters and we saw visible improvement in energy-related charge-offs which drove the 4 basis point reduction in the total net charge-off ratio. Assuming oil prices do not decline significantly, we still expect a remaining $40 million to $60 million of energy-related charge-offs over the coming two or three quarters. ","Nonperforming loans were flat from the prior quarter at 67 basis points, as slightly lower energy NPLs were offset by modest increases in other categories. The ALLL ratio decreased 2 basis points from the prior quarter, as a result of continued improvements in the asset quality of our residential loan portfolio. This improvement, combined with slower loan growth and a lower energy-related provision resulted in total provision expense that declined $49 million compared to the second quarter.","Given good progress so far, we're now able to tighten our expected range for the Company's overall net charge-off ratio to be between 30 and 35 basis points for the full year 2016. We expect a relatively stable allowance ratio in the near- to medium term which should result in a provision expense that modestly exceeds net charge-offs, although there will always be some of level of quarterly variability. ","Turning to balance sheet trends on slide 9, average performing loans increased 1% from the prior quarter, primarily due to growth in consumer banking, as our lending strategies continue to produce growth through each of our major channels. In addition, we completed a $1 billion auto loan sale, consistent with our strategic goals to optimize the balance sheet and increase velocity, while also allowing us to continue to meet the financing needs of our auto dealer clients.","Separately, we reclassified approximately $1 billion of loans from commercial real estate to commercial construction this quarter, in accordance with a revised interpretation of regulatory classification requirements. On a year-over-year basis, average performing loans grew $8.9 billion or 7%, driven by broad-based growth in C&I, CRE, residential and consumer loans. ","Let's take a look at deposits. Average client deposits increased 1% compared to the prior quarter and 7% year-over-year, primarily due to growth in NOW, DDA and money market accounts. More impressively, average client deposits are up a full 17% over the past two years, amongst the highest of our peers. ","This success reflects our overall strategic focus on meeting more clients' deposit and payment needs, our investments in technology platforms and teammates in each of our three operating segments. Rates paid on deposits increased 1 basis point sequentially, a reflection of a slight mix shift towards wholesale banking versus consumer banking clients. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to pricing, with a focus on maximizing the value proposition outside of rate paid for our clients. ","Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. We commenced our 2016 capital plan this quarter which included an increase in our quarterly share buyback amount from $175 million to $240 million and an increase in our dividend from $0.24 per share to $0.26, the combination of which was a 23% increase in total capital return. Despite this increase in capital return and lower AOCI as a result of higher long term rates in the quarter, we still grew tangible book value per share 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year and maintained strong capital levels, evidenced by a 9.7% fully phased-in Basel III CET1 ratio. ","Separately, we have reviewed the Federal Reserve's notice of proposed rulemaking regarding capital and stress test rules. And while there are still details to be ironed out next year, we believe the new rules and comments are a positive development in tailoring regulations towards actual risk profile and complexity. Lastly, our liquidity coverage ratio exceeds current regulatory requirements and we expect to add approximately $1 billion of high quality liquid securities in the fourth quarter to finalize our progress towards the increased 2017 requirements. ","Moving on to the segment overviews, let's begin with consumer banking and private wealth management on slide 12. Net income increased $14 million sequentially, as a result of higher revenue and lower credit costs, but was $21 million lower compared to the prior year, as higher noninterest expense and provision expense offset a 3% increase in revenue. Net interest income was up 2% sequentially and 5% versus the prior year, driven by strong loan and deposit growth. More specifically, excuse me, our investments in direct consumer lending continue to yield positive results. Consumer loans are up 20% year-over-year, as our product offerings and strong client experience have driven continued market share gains.","Noninterest income was up 6% sequentially as a result of discrete items in the current quarter and prior quarter, in addition to seasonally higher trust and investment management fees. Retail investment income is down sequentially and year-over-year, as reduced transaction-related activity has been partially offset by growth in our retail brokerage managed money product, a strategic shift we've been working on for over a year now and one that will continue over the medium term. ","While this is negative for near term retail investment income growth trends, it is positive for our clients and the long term health of our business. Overall asset quality remains strong, with delinquencies and net charge-offs remaining near historically low levels. The sequential decline in provision expense was primarily due to improvements in the home equity portfolio. Noninterest expense increased 4% sequentially and 8% compared to the prior year, generally driven by higher FDIC and regulatory costs, higher occupancy costs and other discrete costs and investments.","We continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our consumer banking business, as we make further investments in talent and technology, while also realizing the benefits of a reduced physical real estate footprint. ","Moving on to wholesale banking on slide 13, we had another strong quarter, in part due to strong market conditions, but more reflective of the continued strategic momentum we're having with our clients. Revenues were up 4%, both sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to capital markets record performance where we continue to see the results of our consistent focus on expanding and deepening client relationships and meeting the capital market needs of all wholesale banking clients.","More specifically, M&A, a business which takes a long time to develop and has been a key area of investment for us, had a record quarter, another proof point that our clients increasingly view us as a trusted strategic advisor. Additionally, capital markets income from non-CIB clients is up 34% year-to-date and we feel confident that this will become a more meaningful contributor to the bottom line, as we work together as a team to become the preferred advisor to our commercial, CRE and private wealth clients.","Net interest income was up 2% sequentially, as a result of modest increases in loan spreads and continued deposit growth. Net income was up sequentially and down year-over-year, largely due to the variance in provision expense which decreased sequentially as a result of the decline in energy net charge-offs, but increased on a year-over-year basis, also driven by energy. Overall, we believe our wholesale banking business is highly differentiated and we'll capitalize on this positive momentum to deliver profitable growth.","Additionally, with the acquisition of Pillar Financial, wholesale's annual revenue should increase by roughly $90 million beginning in 2017. Pillar's efficiency ratio is roughly 80% to 85%. And while this will be dilutive to the overall efficiency ratio, the acquisition of Pillar will be accretive to our capabilities, ROA, ROE and net income. ","Moving to mortgage on slide 14, mortgage was once again a key contributor to our performance this quarter. Revenue was up 1% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven by higher noninterest income. As you may remember last quarter, mortgage production income had a $10 million benefit from a product offering change which altered the timing of revenue recognition. Despite this benefit in the second quarter, production income increased another $7 million sequentially, as a result of higher volumes.","Compared to the prior year, production income increased $60 million, driven by higher volume and higher gain on sale margins. Servicing income decreased sequentially as a result of anticipated increases in decay expense, but increased by $9 million compared to the prior year, as a result of improved hedge performance and portfolio acquisitions. Our servicing UPB is up 2% year-over-year and we have purchased an additional $3 billion which will transfer in the fourth quarter. ","Net income was down $12 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year. The sequential decrease was driven by higher noninterest expense, while the year-over-year decrease was due to approximately $50 million in after-tax discrete benefits recognized in the third quarter of 2015. At a high level, our continued focus on originating high quality mortgages, maintaining executional excellence and gaining smart market share has positively benefited both our clients and our shareholders. ","Looking to the next quarter, pipelines and application activity point to softening, albeit still good momentum in mortgage production volumes. While we don't expect to match this quarter's results, mortgage production income should demonstrate improvement, relative to the fourth quarter of last year.","I'll now turn the call over to Bill for some concluding remarks. ","Bill Rogers","Thanks, Aleem. And to conclude, I'll point to slide 15 which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis and the strategies we have in place. But first, the diversity of our business model helped us mitigate risk and achieve 8% year-over-year revenue growth. We delivered good revenue momentum across both net interest income and noninterest income and in each business segment.","Second, while we had an increase in expenses this quarter, some of which was tied to revenue growth, the year-to-date tangible efficiency ratio is 100 basis points better relative to 2015 and we remain absolutely steadfast in our commitment to achieving our long term sub-60% efficiency ratio target. Third, the revenue growth we produced this quarter is a reflection of the consistent strategic investments we've been making in each of our businesses for now many years. As an example, this quarter was another record quarter for capital markets, an area where we've been making investments in talent, technology and resources for over 10 years. ","More recently, we've also been investing in corporate finance and industry specialists within commercial banking. These investments, combined with our heightened focus on working better together to meet the capital markets needs of all of our wholesale banking clients, continue to contribute to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey's success. In mortgage, we've been making targeted investments in both people and technology, across both origination and servicing. Our origination market share has increased and we continue to make servicing acquisitions. ","Similarly, consumer lending has been another key area of investment over the last few years and it's demonstrating strong, consistent momentum, evidenced by the 20% year-over-year increase in consumer loans. This growth has also resulted in a positive mix shift within the loan portfolio, helping to of offset some of the margin compression in other areas. And fourth, our strong capital position has afforded us the opportunity to grow capital returns and make targeted acquisitions like Pillar Financial. Pillar is accretive to SunTrust's capabilities and our financial position and is also fully consistent with our purpose by helping finance critically-needed affordable housing and senior housing for the communities we serve.","So to conclude, I'm pleased with our Company's performance in the third quarter, though as always, there are things we can improve upon. Our strategic consistency has helped us improve execution and financial performance across the organization. Remaining focused on purpose of moving clients from financial stress to financial competence will continue to be our guiding principle. In living this principle daily, will result in improved financial well-being for our clients, our teammates, our communities and of course, our shareholders. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Ankur and begin the Q&A. ","Ankur Vyas","Thanks, Bill. Iris, we're now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do so, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be coming from the line of Mr. Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Sir, your line is open. ","Matt O'Connor","You were pretty clear in your prepared remarks, that expenses were a bit higher than expected this quarter and you expect them to go down. And maybe it's just semantics, but I'm wondering, do you view the expenses as disappointing this quarter? Did it kind of catch you off guard or was there some discretion there, given the strong revenue? ","Bill Rogers","Well, expenses sort of lie where they lie, in terms of discretion. But maybe I'd say it this way, Matt, so to start at the high level. So it's fall in the southeast, so I'm going to use a football analogy. So we didn't over-spike the ball in the second quarter and similarly, we're not conceding our ability to get in the end zone based on the third quarter and the end zone being improved efficiency ratio for the year. There were things that were positive from the expense side, so obviously expense tied to revenue.","There were things that were strategic investments from the technology side that we wanted to make sure that we continued to do, to support our businesses. There were investments in people and other resources. And then, there were things like, there were some -- you saw the increase in operating loss, some small legal components as part of that. And those are consistent things, but if they're disappointing, yes, absolutely, they're disappointing. And I want to make sure that we continue to keep and I'm confident we've got it, the stringent focus on achieving the overall efficiency ratio.","Remember, it's not the expense target. I think the good news, I think the expense target, so to what we talked about at the beginning of the year, probably is going to go up a little bit. But the good news is, it's going up for the right reasons. It's going up, because we've got more revenue, we've got more capability. And the efficiency ratio target improvement this year over last year and improvement next year over this year, is a consistent theme that we've done for five years. And I don't plan on breaking it. ","Matt O'Connor","And then, just my follow-up would be, what's the magnitude of the decline, costs of [Technical Difficulty] and how can you maybe frame next year's expense run rate?","Aleem Gillani","Magnitude of decline. ","Bill Rogers","I'm sorry, Matt, say that again, I didn't quite get that. ","Matt O'Connor","Yes, how much do you expect costs to go down in the fourth quarter versus 3Q and how do we think about the run rate in 2017, if you have anything to share there? ","Aleem Gillani","All right. Well, let me take that one. So as Bill said, look, we're not happy about the expense level this quarter in and of itself and we're working on ways to bring that down. But I do want to take a step back and look at expenses overall in the context of the Company. You recall, at the beginning of this year, we thought that expenses could be around $5.4 billion for the year, if we had good revenue growth and if we were able to also deliver some operating leverage.","I think when you look now, nine months through the year, we can probably say that revenue growth is actually ahead of expectations and thus, so are expenses. And you can see the improvement in the overall efficiency ratio for the year so far and we expect that to continue for this year. From an operating leverage perspective, our revenues this year are up, north of $400 million and compared to expense growth of about $200 million. So we've delivered $200 million more PP&R and a business that's about 100 basis points more efficient overall.","As I think about now Q4 and looking at next year, I don't think that we're going to consistently operate with an expense base that's north of $1.4 billion per quarter, although it is to some extent going to be revenue dependent. If we continue to deliver revenue growth the way we have this year, obviously our expense base is going to climb for comp, outside processing and other volume-related costs. We've also had some step-ups in expenses, things like the new FDIC assessment and we continue to make investments in technology and talent to help grow revenue.","But as I look to next year, we have delivered I think, Matt, counting this year, five years of continued efficiency ratio improvements. We expect to be able to do that again next year and we've also very consistently said, if it takes $1 of expense to generate $2 of revenue, that is, that's going to be a trade we're willing to make. You can see we did that pretty well exactly in the nine months this year, relative to last year, right? We had $200 million more expenses and $400 million more revenue.","So that, we've done that. We're going to try to continue to grow revenue more than expenses and we're going to continue to try to make this Company more efficient and look to bring our efficiency ratio down next year, relative to this year. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of John McDonald of Bernstein. Your line is open. ","John McDonald","I wanted to follow up on the comments around the net interest margin line. You mentioned in a static rate environment, you'd likely see 2 to 3 basis points of NIM compression in the current rate environment. What's driving that? And then, I'll just ask my follow-up now. And if you do get one Fed rate hike, how much would that help incrementally? ","Aleem Gillani","Well, John, what drove the reduction or what will drive the reduction of a couple basis points in the short term, I think is going to continue to be that, new production yields are generally equal to or slightly lower than portfolio yields. So that volume inevitably is going to grind into NIM and bring margins down just a little bit. But I think in the context of net interest income, if you look at the last several years, we've been able to despite the decline in NIM continue to bring net interest income generally up.","And if we continue to get solid loan growth the way that we have been and expect, we do expect that we'll be able to bring net interest income up somewhat. I think net interest income can grow. It will be modest, perhaps, relative to where we were this quarter, but I do expect net income to climb, despite the slight decline in NIMs. ","John McDonald","Okay. And the impact from a fed hike if we do get one in December, what kind of impact would you expect late in the quarter and maybe into first quarter from a hike? ","Aleem Gillani","Well, probably no impact in Q4 for a hike in December. But if there's a 25 basis point hike in December and then I look to Q1 coming out of that, if you look at our overall asset sensitivity numbers, you see we're about 2.1% asset sensitive. That would translate, given a fed hike of 25 basis points and given the profile of the rate risk we have across the curve, probably to about a couple of basis points of NIM in Q1. ","Bill Rogers","And John, this is Bill. By the way, I would really characterize that, if we get a rate increase post-election and that results in consumer confidence and business confidence and that's exponentially more beneficial to us than a 25 basis point increase, running through the balance sheet and the income statement. So if it's a signal of a positive development and gets people off the sidelines and into the queue, I think we're just, never been better positioned to take advantage of that. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of [indiscernible] of CLSA. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","Can you give more color on capital markets? I mean, when I look at the largest banks and then I look at you, your growth rates are a lot more for trading and investment banking. And so, would you describe that as product mix, geographic mix? Are you getting share gains? And the retreat of the European banks, do you see that at all or are you taking more risk? ","Aleem Gillani","I'd say yes to all the other -- the first questions and no to the last one. ","Bill Rogers","So I do think, Mike, it's as you said, it's a combination of a lot of things. And the great news is that, the diversity of the increase, so it's not sort of coming from one thing. It's not coming one geography. Even on the trading line, it's pretty diverse. I mean, for us, fixed income is 30% or so of that. So you also get the benefit of the derivative part. So just the core part of running our business better, foreign exchange, whatever, all the components that go into trading.","And then across investment banking, as Aleem said, I mean, M&A had a great quarter. If you put sort of M&A, equity, equity sales and trading all into some bucket, that's 30%-plus of our contribution this quarter. So it's well-distributed. I think the part that I mentioned also in my comments that we're starting to see and I'm excited about for the future, is what we've built in the commercial side, really sort of to try to really replicate what we're doing in the -- in CIB and get that same advisory type primary positioning in the commercial market.","And we made a lot of investments there, somewhere between commercial and CRE, I mean, we're up 20%-plus and really building good momentum in that segment as well which is like to me, like building a whole new industry vertical in our business. And it's doing it without having to take more risk, because we already have the balance sheet. We've already committed the balance sheet to those clients. We're really now getting the additional fee-based advisory business from that. ","Aleem Gillani","Mike, the reason that trading might look like it's a very high growth rate to you, is because of that CVA charge in Q2. That was a $17 million amount as a result of a methodology change. And so, that might be one of the reasons why trading looks high to you now. But from a risk perspective, if you think about it in VaR terms, our daily VaR in capital markets is about $5 million or less. So we're not a risk-taking business as such. We're very much a client facilitation business. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of [indiscernible] of Jefferies. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst","I heard in the prepared comments that you're still expecting pretty good loan growth this quarter. Obviously, we saw the $1 billion moved out on the auto side. Sequentially, C&I was down and a lot of other banks have seen that. Can you just talk about the opportunity set, still that you see out. And Bill, I heard your point to John's question about the, was a rate hike indicate better things out there, can you just talk about end demand in C&I? And then your philosophy of kind of maintaining the ROE potential of each relationship, versus what you're seeing in the market? ","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think we've been really clear, is we don't manage to loan growth. I mean, that's an outcome. So if I look and I'll get to C&I, but if I look sort of corporately for the quarter, relative to this quarter last year, production was up 6.5% or so. And overall, we have really good pipelines, paydowns were up a bit and then we had the $1 billion loan sale. So that sort of balances out sort of where the total piece is. ","As it relates to C&I, there's some seasonal things. So for example, the dealer portfolio goes down a little bit in the third quarter, revolver utilization goes down a bit. We had some more paydowns. Our production in C&I is fine. The CRE production is down which you would expect. And then, if I look at sort of the pipeline, the pipeline looks -- in C&I looks good. So the pipeline looks okay. So we did have sort of flattish, but I think some of that's seasonal. And the metrics that I look at, production and pipelines is sort of where I start with, those look okay. ","Aleem Gillani","And I think the auto loan sales helps us look flattish. Otherwise, we certainly would have grown our average more than you see here. And I think that's a demonstration as Bill said, Ken, of we don't manage to loan growth. If we wanted to show loans up, we would have just not sold those loans. But the reason we sold them was, it was the right thing to do. They're relatively low ROA assets for us. And we can improve our returns for the Company overall, even though it might look optically, like our loan growth isn't as high as some would want. ","Bill Rogers","And then, you also asked a question about ROE by relationship. And we have I think, an incredible amount of intensity on that focus. That's something that we've engrained into the system, sort of from day one. And what you can see is the, the benefit of that, is you can see that fee income growing, without the balance sheet having to grow. And over time, we would hope that can continue to be disproportionate. ","So that discipline is well-engrained in the system and we see it in the velocity of the balance sheet. That's another thing that I look at. So things that are low yielding and we're not achieving the hurdle rates, we're pretty quick to take action. And we hold our relationship managers, I would put in the category of highly accountable, to achieving the things that we've both set out for and taking advantage of all the investments that we've made. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. ","John Pancari","A quick question again around expenses, I know you indicated that the fourth quarter level was elevated. When it comes to the regulatory compliance costs, could you give us an idea of the, if those costs have are peaked and the timing of when you could really see an abatement in those levels and if you've quantified the annualized compliance and regulatory costs that you're incurring at this point? Thanks. ","Bill Rogers","Well, let me answer your second one first or perhaps not answer your second one first. We don't actually quantify our regulatory and compliance costs, in and of themselves, because they sit on so many different line items and are part of our total Company. If you think about investments in technology, if we need to add a module onto a system to make sure that it's completely regulatory compliant, that, the cost of investing in that module we don't show as regulatory or compliance costs specifically and call that out. So that's kind of a non-answer to your second question. ","But in terms of overall regulatory and compliance costs, if I look forward, John, I don't think that in the short- to medium term I would think of regulatory costs in general abating or declining. I think we're in an environment, where we would expect regulatory and compliance costs to be generally stable or increasing over time. And just the environment that we're in, I don't see realistically that anybody in the industry is going to see regulatory and compliance costs fall off. ","Aleem Gillani","I might add to that, maybe the slope might change a little bit, but I think the slope will still be positive. We continue to look for efficiencies as well, in the compliance and regulatory and risk components of what we do. And then, it's offset. So if we just sat here over year ago, we wouldn't have been talking about DOL and the FDIC increase, as an example. So there are things that are going to continue to be new in the fabric of what you do and how you run the business. And I think we've got the scale and the competence to absorb those and continue to execute our business. And all the commitments we make around efficiency ratio are anticipating that it would be increased. ","John Pancari","Now, you've alluded to the potential to mitigate some of that upside pressure, not only in regulatory, but also in the occupancy side and you indicated the ability to address the footprint. Can you talk a little about branch consolidation plans and the timing and potential magnitude there? Thanks. ","Bill Rogers","Yes, if you look at us, since 2011, I mean, our branches are down 17%. So this is not some of a new thing for us, we've been in the branch consolidation and branch maximization and optimization mode for now quite a few years. And I would anticipate over the next three plus years, we'd have another 15% or so in branches. There'll be some opening of new branches. There'll be some closing of branches.","There'll be some shrinking of branches. As Aleem talked out about, we have sale leaseback opportunity within our portfolio. I think you know that our markets are such, that they're concentrated. Our branches are generally concentrated in urban centers, so that gives us -- affords us a lot more opportunity I think to optimize. We've got the combination of in-store and traditional banking centers which also gives us an opportunity to optimize.","So we feel that the branches will continue to go down, the investments in digital will offset that. And I would think, as Aleem alluded to, occupancy expense will sort of level out, because some of those increases will be offset by the efficiencies that we're going to achieve. ","John Pancari","And Bill, that 15%, that's net? ","Bill Rogers","Yes, that's net of new branches that we're opening, yes. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question will be coming from the line of Mr. Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities. ","Jason Harbes","It's actually Jason Harbes on for Matt. So a question on fees. A very, really impressive results this quarter, fee income up about, I think 13% year-over-year. And you gave us some good guidance around some of the different line items. Sounds like deposit charges will be down sequentially from the posting order change, mortgage will be down seasonally as well.","But and I guess, you're going to get the benefit of Pillar Financial which I don't think you disclosed the potential impact. But just adding everything together, I mean, maybe could you comment on the sustainability of the fee income growth that you saw this quarter, as we head into the fourth quarter? ","Aleem Gillani","Sure thing, Jason and I think you've already called several of them. If I think about overall consumer banking and private wealth, there's pluses and minuses in there. With the effect of the posting order, that will be a little bit of a negative. But as we continue to bring in more clients into our private wealth business and move them into an asset management model, they're very good long term fees that I think are going to be generated, as we help that set of clients. ","Mortgage overall, as you know, seasonally Q2 and Q3 are the best seasons for mortgage. Q4 and Q1 are typically slower. So as we move into Q4, mortgage fees probably come off. But looking out over the course of the next year or two, we've built a terrific mortgage business and we're gaining market share. And as we do that, I feel good about where our mortgage business is going overall. ","Within the wholesale banking business, we've already talked a fair bit about the growth in capital markets, about our business model that brings big bank capabilities and expertise to our core commercial client base. And as we continue to work more with that client base, I think you're going to see fees and wholesale banking grow, as we gain market share there.","So if I try to put all of those things together over time, Jason, the net fees for us even excluding Pillar, I think are going to be going up over time. Adding Pillar to that is only a positive. And as I said earlier about Pillar specifically, I think in 2017, we'll see about $90 million of fee revenue from Pillar. ","Jason Harbes","Okay. ","Bill Rogers","It will be a little bit different from fourth quarter of 2015. And the IB side, we have more momentum and we've expanded our scope and our business is just bigger. So I expect it to be better than fourth quarter of 2015. And on the mortgage side, while purchases are sort of following a seasonal pattern and it will and we're a good, strong purchase player, we also have still some refinance left in there.","So I expect fourth quarter of 2016, to be better than fourth quarter of 2015 in mortgage. So maybe a slight from the third quarter, but both probably better than the fourth quarter of last year. ","Jason Harbes","Just drilling down, if I could on the card business within fee income, that's been pretty flattish, despite some pretty impressive growth in the receivables side. So I mean, is that a function of the increasingly generous rewards that you're offering to kind of drive greater card member engagement? ","Aleem Gillani","You're right, it is a highly competitive business overall, but as we grow our card business, we'll get the benefits of scale. And as we continue to build that business out, both in consumer and in our wholesale banking business, those scale synergies are going to be picking up and we expect the fee income from card to start to do better. ","Bill Rogers","Yes and we'll start seeing the outstandings. So we've got a lot more cards in people's wallets. And I think as you accurately pointed out, the way the card business works is when you're growing, you tend to push on the fee side, because rewards sort of offset the growth in fees. But then the outstandings follow and they follow on a multi quarter basis. So I think, at overall, we'll see the growth, but we're just going to see it in some different categories. ","Jason Harbes","Okay. And if I can just sneak one last one in on cards again. Have you guys set a target for where you'd like that to be? It's about 1% of the loan book today, so still small, it's a $1 billion portfolio. But do you have a longer term target for where you'd like to grow that business? Thanks. ","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I mean, we don't set a target as it relates to credit cards. So we've kept a philosophy that this is a relationship-oriented business for our client base. So as our client base grows and our card product becomes more relevant and it's part of lighting the way to financial well-being for more of our clients, then it will grow proportionately. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Steve Scouten of Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. ","Steve Scouten","I wanted to get a little clarity there on Pillar. I know you just mentioned it could add about $90 million in fees in 2017. But what kind of expense load would you expect there as well or maybe what kind of generic efficiency ratio does that business tend to possess? ","Aleem Gillani","Steve, Pillar has about, what I expect to see in 2017 from Pillar as the first year, is about an 80% or 85% efficiency ratio. So it's not going to be accretive to the Company's overall efficiency ratio in the first year, but it will be accretive to our return on equity. It will be accretive to our net income. And it will allow us to get into businesses that we're not in today, cover more clients and satisfy them in new ways that we can't do today. And then, if I start to look out to 2018 and 2019, as we build better connections through Pillar with new clients, I expect the growth rate in net income to be better from there. ","Steve Scouten","And then, just one other drill-down on the expenses, sounded like you said $1.4 billion is probably not a number you'll be materially higher than heading into 2017. But 1Q 2017 tends to be a high quarter for you guys on employee comp and benefits. So how can we think about that and your ability to manage 1Q expenses in particular, with that seasonal increase? ","Aleem Gillani","Well, you're right, first quarter for us is always going to be higher. That's just the way it works in our industry. And so, I do expect that for that quarter, in and of itself we'll have -- if you look at one line item being expenses, it will be higher than you would see otherwise, but we don't really think about one quarter in and of itself, in the context of running the overall business.","Our commitment has been, we're going to continue to make this business more efficient over time. We've done that now for five years in a row. And right now, looking out into 2017, I fully expect that our 2017 efficiency ratio is going to look the same or better than 2016 does. And on a full year basis, across the entire income statement, that's what we try to do. ","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Marty Mosby, Vining Sparks. Your line is open. ","Marty Mosby","We can wrap it up with a couple questions here. You mentioned the higher operating losses this quarter and potentially the litigation that might have been in there. I'm looking at the prior quarter, it was around $20 million, this quarter was $35 million. Is that about the right delta or were there other expenses that were kind of unusual like that, that were embedded in the numbers this quarter? ","Bill Rogers","Marty, that is indeed right about the right delta and there's not one big thing in there. We're talking about several small items, none of which in and of themselves, were worth calling out. ","Marty Mosby","And Aleem, I'm going to dig into two subjects here. First, on the net interest margin, when you talk about the compression you've had in the last two quarters, you always mention the balance sheet repricing. But yet there's a lot of financial events that are going on that, I think are affecting the run rate of the margin right now. First, you have the debt issuance. That would have been dilutive to your NIM, while if you're matching it up, wouldn't affect NII so bad. ","And then you talked about in the fourth quarter adding $1 billion in liquid assets for finalizing your liquidity coverage ratio which would also be punitive to your net interest margin, while not as effective on your net interest income. So it seems like there's some things behind that are -- which are exaggerating the compression related to the balance sheet repricing. I just wanted to make sure I was reading that right. ","Aleem Gillani","Marty, again, you've got it exactly right. There's lots of things going on in there, some positive, some negative. And while if I look at NIM, I can see NIM declining a couple basis points in Q4. When I look at NII for all of those reasons, including the growth in securities, I do think that NII, we can continue to increase from the levels you saw in Q3 this year. ","Marty Mosby","And then lastly and this may be too detailed for the call, but your segments are all showing declines year-over-year, with expenses growing faster than revenues. However, the segment you don't show is corporate which when you look at the net interest income is up almost $70 million over the last year. So is there some transfer of pricing or some mechanism that is creating, somehow reallocating more to the corporate versus the other segments and then kind of creating somewhat of a misleading picture when you look at the segment reports? ","Bill Rogers","Marty, your previous training is causing you to look into this with a lot of detail and again, you're exactly right. If you think about how FTP works over time, the effect of FTP changes can be exaggerated at turns in rates.","So when rates are moving up and they turn and go down, you kind of have an exaggerated FTP effect for a year. When rates have been going down and they kind of turn and start to go up, you see that same effect. And in our case for 2016, you're seeing exactly some of that in FTP for 2016. I would expect some of that to dissipate, as we start to get a trend in rates, with rates going up over time. ","Ankur Vyas","This concludes our call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

I'm going to start this morning's call with a quick overview of the quarter, and I'm going to pass it on to Aleem to provide details on the results. I'm then going to come back and wrap up the call with some highlights from a business segment perspective, where you'll see we generated continued positive momentum in our Consumer and Wholesale businesses, but faced some headwinds in mortgage.","Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.68 and net income grew to $365 million. Ongoing credit improvement, coupled with continued expense discipline, drove the earnings growth up 36% over last year.","On a sequential quarter basis, both net interest and noninterest income were down modestly. The net interest income decline was from the expected decrease in our commercial loan swap income. The decline in noninterest income was driven by lower mortgage-related income. However, this was almost entirely offset by broad-based growth in other noninterest income categories, most notably, investment banking income and wealth management-related fees. Our intensive and ongoing efforts to drive efficiency improvements produced a 10% reduction in noninterest expense from last year. Core operating expenses continued to be well controlled this quarter, though the more volatile cyclical costs increased. This increase was something we expected coming off a low first quarter levels, though its magnitude was higher than I care to see. Overall, we saw a 2% sequential quarter increase in total expenses and an increase in our efficiency ratio. We still anticipate that these cyclical expenses will continue to trend down, and our focus on achieving our efficiency ratio objectives remains high.","Average performing loans were up about $600 million during the quarter and the ongoing portfolio diversification efforts continued, with targeted growth in both C&I and commercial real estate loans. The credit quality story continues to be a good one, with nonperforming loans and net charge-offs hitting their lowest levels in over 5 years. Nonperforming loans declined by over 50% from last year and this quarter's net charge-off ratio improved to 59 basis points.","Lastly, our capital position continue to improve, with our Tier 1 common ratio reaching new all-time high at an estimated 10.15%. Consistent with our CCAR announcement, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 to $0.10 per share during the quarter, and we also commenced our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million of our common stock during the quarter.","Overall, for the quarter, we demonstrated progress in our strategic initiatives to grow and diversify our business, and our financial results continue to trend favorably. While we see solid pipelines and much improved loan production, our loan balance growth isn't quite yet what we'd like, and near-term mortgage revenue is likely to slow. However, the improving operating environment and southeastern economy, coupled with our enhanced focus and execution, I believe bode well for SunTrust future opportunities.","And with that, let me turn it over to Aleem to walk you through the quarter in more detail.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin my comments today with summary observations on this quarter's key earnings drivers and then, we'll delve deeper on subsequent slides.","Our profitability growth continued this quarter with earnings per share of $0.68, which was $0.05 more than last quarter and $0.18 higher than last year. The sequential quarter increase was due to the ongoing improvement in credit quality, which resulted in a lower provision for loan losses and this more than offset the modest revenue decline and expense increase.","Relative to last year, the 36% increase in earnings per share was due to a lower provision for credit losses and a 10% decline in noninterest expense. The latter of which was a result of our efficiency improvements and the abatement of cyclically high costs. Lower net interest income, due to the impact of the interest rate environment as well as declines in mortgage and trading revenue, were partial offsets. We'll review all of the underlying trend in more detail starting on Slide 5.","Net interest income declined sequentially by $9 million. This was driven entirely by the $14 million reduction in commercial loan swap income, partially offset by an additional business day in the current quarter and modestly higher average earning assets. Consistent with our prior guidance, the net interest margin declined 8 basis points. The NIM compression resulted from the commercial loan swap income decline, as well as the ongoing compression in earning asset yields due to the low-rate environment. A modest reduction in deposit rates paid was a partial offset.","Relative to the prior year, net interest income was $64 million lower and the net interest margin declined 14 basis points. The primary drivers of both were lower asset yields, a reduction in commercial loan swap income and the elimination of The Coca-Cola Company dividend. These factors were partially offset by favorable shifts in the deposit mix, lower deposit rates and the benefits from an over $3 billion reduction in our long-term debt.","The steepening in the yield curve over the course of the quarter obviously is topical. So before we move on, let's spend a minute there. As you're all aware, a steeper curve is beneficial to spread income for the banking industry. Of course, higher short-term rates in conjunction with a steeper curve would be even better, but we have to start somewhere. Before touching on the positives of the steeper curve, let me first acknowledge a couple of the negatives, both of which we'll discuss more on subsequent slides. Higher rates are likely to lead to less mortgage refinance activity, as well as a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income. And we saw both of those occur this quarter. That said, I don't think many of us expected the refi boom to last too much longer. And while the mark-to-market value on our investment portfolio was lower today, the value of the entire balance sheet, most notably deposits, which obviously are not mark-to-market, is considerably more. If rates stay at their current levels, it will take a little time before the positive benefits of the steeper curve evidence themselves in the earnings string. For example, as existing investment securities and mortgages provide cash flow over the coming quarters, we'll reap the benefit by redeploying the proceeds at higher yields. We're also staying agile and trying to be opportunistic in managing through the rate environment. Specifically, during the second quarter, we issued 10-year debt early in the quarter when rates were low and locked in a very attractive coupon. Late in the quarter, after rates increased, we added some received fixed pay floating commercial loan swaps and we expect this to aid net interest income in the near term to the tune of about $8 million per quarter.","All told, as we look toward the coming quarters and assuming current rates hold, we expect the steeper yield curve to help mitigate the declining trend in net interest margin, as well as to provide an increasing benefit to net interest income over time.","With respect to our NIM outlook, specifically for the back half of this year, we anticipate a mid-single digit basis point decline in the third quarter, followed by a more stable margin in Q4.","Moving on to Slide 6. Noninterest income declined modestly from the prior quarter, primarily due to lower mortgage-related revenue, which was largely offset by broad-based increases in other categories. I'll focus first on mortgage production income, which was $133 million for the quarter and down $26 million sequentially. The origination fee component of this income stream was about $60 million and stable to the prior quarter as closed loan volumes was similar to the strong levels in Q1.","However, gain on sale revenue, which you'll recall we book at rate lock, declined due to the significant increase in mortgage rates. Mortgage servicing income was $1 million for the quarter, down $37 million sequentially and well below recent quarters. A lower net hedge gain was the driver, as rates were volatile during the quarter and the net hedge performance was essentially breakeven versus being a positive contributor to servicing income in recent quarters.","While mortgage revenue was down, other fee income streams rebounded nicely from first quarter levels. Most notable was investment banking income, which was $93 million for the quarter and up $25 million sequentially, driven by increased syndicated finance and high-yield bond fees. Wealth Management-related revenue also increased with trust income and retail investment income up a combined $14 million due to improved market conditions and managed account growth.","Looking year-over-year, noninterest income declined $82 million. Mortgage servicing income fell $69 million, driven by lower net hedge outperformance, as well as from declines in the value of the MSR due to the higher collection of cash flows, which is a result of the increase in refinance volume.","I will note that we provided a summary schedule in the appendix, which gives you some additional clarity on the moving pieces within servicing income. In general, MSR net hedge income depends upon the rate environment, with periods of low interest rate volatility, such as we experienced over most of last year, more likely to produce favorable results than during a more volatile period, such as this quarter.","As it relates to the decay, one partial benefit from a slowing refi market is that decay is expected to trend lower as refinance volume declines. Trading income also declined on a year-over-year basis as the increase in rates during the current quarter yielded lower fixed income trading results. On the flip side, investment banking income was higher by almost 25% and mortgage production increased as the decline in the repurchase provision more than offset lower gain on sale revenue.","Touching briefly on mortgage repurchases, we continued to have an increased pace of resolution activity this quarter on the part of both SunTrust and the GSEs. You're probably aware that the FHFA has a published objective of completing rep and warranty demands on pre-conservatorship loan activity during 2013. Likewise, SunTrust is equally interested in working through the demands as quickly as possible. This increased pace of resolution evidenced itself in the second quarter by a lower pending population and higher charge-offs, as well as increased profile requests. Meanwhile, repurchase demands fell relative to first quarter levels.","Let's move on to expenses on Slide 7. You'll recall that last quarter, we had an over $70 million or 50% sequential quarter decline in our credit-related expenses and operating losses, falling to levels that were below our normalized projections. As expected, these cyclical costs increased this quarter. Although as Bill noted, more than we would have liked, and drove the $34 million or 2% increase in total noninterest expenses. This increase was due entirely to a specific legal accrual recorded in the operating loss line item.","Over the past several years, we and other banks have received various claims made by government agencies, primarily around our precrisis mortgage origination and servicing activities, a matter this quarter, is also mortgage related. And while it is not fully resolved, based on the information we have at hand, we believed it prudent to make an accrual this quarter for the estimated cost of resolution. Collections expense also rose, primarily due to an accelerated pace of default resolution. Partially offsetting these increases were lower core operating costs, including reductions in employee benefits expense due to seasonality.","Looking at year-over-year trends, our efficiency improvement is evident in the $149 million or 10% noninterest expense decline. Roughly half of this was due to lower core operating costs, including compensation, legal and consulting. And the balance was due to the abatement of cyclical expenses. Year-to-date, our expenses were down over $300 million and prudent expense management remains an area of focus for Bill and our entire management team.","As you can see on Slide 8, while our efficiency ratio improved year-over-year, it went the wrong direction sequentially due to the cyclical cost increase and the modest revenue decline. While this is my least favorite slide this quarter, we promised you and our SunTrust teammates transparency around this issue. We remain committed to achieving an approximate 65% efficiency ratio in 2013, and to our long-term target of below 60%.","Turning to credit quality. The notable improvement in our asset quality trends continued this quarter. Net charge-offs, which were at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007, declined by about 50% from last year and 20% sequentially, driven by the residential portfolio. The improving housing market certainly contributed as we're benefiting from fewer delinquencies, lower loss severities and higher prices upon disposition of foreclosed assets.","Concurrent with lower net charge-offs, the provision expense has declined, while the allowance for loan and lease losses has also come down, albeit at a slower pace in recent quarters, as the allowance ratio has reached a lower absolute level. Similar to net charge-offs, nonperforming loans also declined about 50% from last year and 20% sequentially. Every loan category improved, most notably, residential loans. Contributing to the sequential quarter decline was the return of about $220 million in Chapter 7 bankruptcy loans to accruing status. You will recall that in the fourth quarter of last year, we reclassified about $230 million of residential loans previously discharged from Chapter 7 bankruptcy to nonperforming. While the preponderance of these loans had been current on their payments for some time, the reclassification to nonaccruing status was made to be consistent with regulatory guidance around this topic. Because these loans have now remained current for 6 months since the time they were moved to NPL, the $220 million was reclassified back into performing loans this quarter. This reclassification had no impact on our second quarter net charge-offs or loan loss provision. And these Chapter 7-related loans will remain classified as accruing TDRs.","Lastly, on this topic, I'll point out that even excluding the impact of this reclassification, nonperforming loans declined by 7% sequentially. As we look to next quarter, we anticipate that nonperforming loans will continue to trend lower and for net charge-offs to be relatively stable to their second quarter level. Consistent with our comments in recent quarters, we continue to expect future credit quality improvement to be led by residential loans as commercial and consumer category credit metrics already approximate normalized levels.","Turning to balance sheet trends on Slide 10. Average performing loans increased sequentially by $600 million or about 0.5 percentage point. C&I was the largest contributor and commercial real estate was also up. Bill will give you a little more color on both of these when he discusses our Wholesale segment results. Most other loan categories were relatively stable to the prior quarter, with the exception of continued takedowns in our government-guaranteed mortgage portfolio. Relative to the prior year, performing loans were down modestly. Guaranteed student loans and guaranteed mortgages declined a combined $4 billion, primarily due to the loan sales we executed late in 2012. Offsetting this, we had organic loan -- organic growth in C&I of $3.7 billion or 7%. Additionally, consumer loans, excluding guaranteed student loans, were up $1.1 billion or about 9%. Overall, loan growth remains moderate, though we continue to see some potential precursors to it improving, most notably in commercial loan pipelines that remained at healthy levels during the quarter, and gradual improvement in consumer and business confidence.","Turning now to deposits. Average client deposits declined by about $1 billion this quarter, as growth in DDA was more than offset by seasonal reductions in commercial client tax accounts, as well as ongoing declines in time deposits. Relative to the prior year, deposits were up 1%, though the underlying favorable shift in the deposit mix was the more notable story. Lower cost deposits were up almost $4 billion, with DDA the largest contributor, growing by over $2 billion or 6%. Concurrently, higher cost time deposits were managed down by $3 billion or 17%. This favorable shift in deposit mix helped drive the approximately 20 basis points or $43 million year-over-year reduction in interest-bearing deposit cost.","Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital again expanded, this time, by approximately $300 million, and the Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 10.15%. Based upon our current interpretation of the final Basel III capital rules issued on July 2, we estimate our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio to be approximately 9.5%.","As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio and our tangible book value per share both declined modestly, which was due to lower unrealized gains on our securities portfolio from the increase in interest rates during the quarter. This was largely offset by higher retained earnings. As Bill noted earlier, we commenced our share repurchase program this quarter, buying back $50 million of our common stock. Per the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the CCAR process, we have the capacity and the intent to repurchase up to another $150 million through the first quarter of 2014.","With that, I'll now turn things back over to Bill to cover our business segment performance.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem. And I'll move to Slide 13. Taking a look at our business from a segment basis reveals several favorable operating trends. In our Consumer and Private Wealth Management businesses, net income was up 21% over last year, result of continued credit quality improvement and a 9% reduction in noninterest expenses due to changes in our staffing model and our branch network. We've steadily improved the efficiency ratio in this business, driving it down over 200 basis points from the last year to 65.4%. We obviously continue -- we need to continue to focus here, but we have good momentum behind us.","The loan balances were down from last year due to the fourth quarter student loan sales. Consumers willingness to borrow seems to be improving. We continue to see strong production across our consumer lending products with production volume up 16%. Overall, deposits were down 1%, though DDA continued to increase and consumer time deposits were down 17%, marking another quarter of favorable mix trends.","Now let's take a closer look at our Wholesale business this quarter. Our Wholesale business had its second highest net income quarter ever and grew 37% over last year. Ongoing improvement in credit quality drove a substantial decrease in the provision for credit losses, as well as a reduction in OREO expenses. A 10% expense decline from last year, as well as higher net interest income, helped drive down the efficiency ratio over 650 basis points to 52%. The segment had solid loan growth as we continued to grow C&I. Growth was driven by our not-for-profit and government industry vertical and dealer businesses, along with our large corporate lending areas, most notably, asset securitization, our energy vertical and asset-based lending.","As you're aware, Wholesale is an important business for us. We've had a lot of success already in our strategic initiatives to grow its business, and much of that continued this quarter. Corporate investment banking turned another strong quarter with near-record net income. Our efforts to develop lead relationships have resulted in a 20% increase from January of last year and more than double what they were at the beginning of 2010. We're also gaining momentum on our efforts to grow targeted new businesses -- new business and commercial real estate. After reaching an inflection point in the first quarter, CRE was again profitable with further sequential growth and loan balances and marked production increases over last year. We continue to develop our pipeline and believe we'll be successful in our efforts to drive further growth here.","Now let's take a look at mortgage. As you heard in some of Aleem's comments, our mortgage business was challenged this quarter. Continued credit quality improvement helped shrink the overall net loss from last year. However, lower servicing and gain on sale revenue has increased and -- as well as increased cyclical cost drove a larger sequential quarter net loss. This quarter's closed production volume was $9 billion, which was the highest level since the third quarter of 2009. That said, as you're aware, the state of affairs in the mortgage business changed a lot in the latter part of the quarter due to the increase in rates. And we do expect refi volume to begin abating during the second half of the year.","Purchase volume, on the other hand, continues to gain momentum, though obviously, not nearly enough to offset the expected refi decline. While overall volume in our mortgage segment is expected to decline, let me provide a little perspective here. Noninterest income on our mortgage segment was about $130 million this quarter, which equated to 6% of SunTrust's total revenue. And while mortgage fee income declined by about $65 million sequentially, our business mix diversity helped mitigate this as our total revenue was relatively stable. Furthermore, ongoing credit quality improvement, which also happens to be primarily mortgage related, helped drive earnings growth this quarter.","So in summary, considerable opportunity continues to remain across our markets. We have targeted strategies to address these opportunities and are seeing meaningful progress towards our goal. We remain focused on our priorities to grow profitably and improve our efficiency.","With that said, Kris, let me turn it back over to you, and we can start taking some questions.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Bill. Carolene, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Paul Miller from FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Real quick housekeeping question. On your income statement, where it says mortgage banking, $133 million, is that net of the provision?","William Henry Rogers","The repurchase provision for the quarter, Paul?","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, it is. Yes.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So that $133 million is net, so if that provision wasn't there, it would be even closer to $200 million?","William Henry Rogers","Now the provision for the quarter -- the repurchase provision for the quarter was $15 million.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Oh, $15 million. I'm sorry, yes. So it would be closer to $133 million plus $15 million?","William Henry Rogers","Exactly.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, can you add some more color on your purchase volumes? Like, are you guys increasing that dynamic by going after that product or is it just coming in the door? Because I know we've seen purchase volume up pretty strong across the space.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, we've always been a good purchase mortgage business. And you certainly saw that mix, substantially, in the latter part of the quarter. I mean, our closed purchase volume in June was 40% of our business. Of course, it was down overall, but it was 40% of our business. Our absent purchase are up fairly substantially. And if you look at us and think about some of the markets that we operate in and some of the recovery in those markets, we're pretty bullish on what we see on the purchase side. Now that being said, and I said in my comments, that's not enough to offset refi.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, one last question is, what percentage of your stuff is -- are HARP loans? Do you guys know that?","William Henry Rogers","In the quarter, about 20% of our refi was HARP. What you'll see is, applications of HARP are down, down fairly substantially, which wouldn't be a surprise.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Erika Penala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Aleem, I just wanted to ask you a question about the comments you made on your MSR hedging. I guess, and I apologize if this seems like a silly question but I always thought that when long rates went up, then we could expect more hedge gains as you revalue your portfolio higher. But you mentioned on the call or during your prepared remarks that it would continue to go down, but decay less. Am I misunderstanding that?","Aleem Gillani","Yes. Erika, yes, a little bit. The decay is a reduction to income. If you take a look at the deck, in the back of the new slide that we put in to try and help you. If you take a look at Page 27 in the appendix, and you'll see a line there called decay. And that's a reduction to servicing income. And as refis decline, that decay ought to reduce. That's what -- that's the point I was trying to make. And so that ought to help servicing income over time.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And my follow-up question is on your gain on sale margin. Could you help us think about, as we forecast out, how we should think about your purchase gain on sale, your non-HARP refi gain on sale and your HARP gain on sale?","Aleem Gillani","Well, we -- the gain on sale, in general across those, is relatively similar in terms of margins. We don't have a higher -- we don't charge a higher rate for HARP, for example, versus other loans in general. Where we get a slightly higher gain on HARP is because we put most HARP loans in through our least expensive channel, consumer direct. And so the lower expense for HARP loans leads to a, sort of, slightly higher gain on those loans. I don't know if that gets to the point of your question. But in general, if you look at our margins across the board, they're not that much higher in terms of rates charged for HARP relative to other loans.","Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So just to make sure I understand, and I'll get back in the queue, the mix shift shouldn't have an impact on your gain on sale margin going forward?","Aleem Gillani","It may have a little bit as, if HARP declines and therefore, we have less HARP to put through our least expensive channel, that might have a slight negative impact on our overall gain on sale.","William Henry Rogers","Well, Erika, let me also come back to a point I think you asked on your first question on MSR, on the hedging activity. We hedge our MSR out every day, not just every quarter, but every day. And so the volatility in MSR is a volatility that we're generally not willing to take on a day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter basis because we treat those at fair value. So if you think about MSR a little bit like a trading asset, that's volatility we're not willing to absorb. So we hedge that out. If you, again, take a look at Page 27, what you'll see is that the write-up in MSR this quarter was almost perfectly offset by the hedge. The hedge worked really well, and if that's getting to your point about you were expecting to see a big gain from MSR, that did, in fact, occur. The asset did go up, but the hedge worked very well to offset that.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just questions on expenses. There's a bunch of moving parts, obviously, and I just wanted to understand a couple of things. First of all, can you give us an update on -- you had previously said something about environmental moving back towards $325 plus or minus $50 million. And obviously, we're back up this quarter, as expected, to about a 500 run rate. So can you just give us an understanding of, do you expect to trend back down towards $325 million plus or minus $50 million? Or from what you see, could we get distinctly better than that at some point?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think, this quarter, we did have a tick back up for a couple of reasons, Ken. Some of that was a little bit than we expected. And I think last quarter, we guided to a slight increase back up, just because of the big step down we had in Q1. And the Q1 number would have taken us to sort of well below that $325 million if you had annualized that. But if you look at, if you remove the 1 item, the mortgage-related legal accrual item, which goes into that -- and you can see some detail on this on Page 29 of our appendix. If you remove that 1 item, then, if you annualize the first half of the year, we're actually in line with that normalized level of $325 million plus or minus.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Well, exactly. And so if you're already there, I would presume that there's still a very good amount to go from here or is there any reason why that wouldn't continue to improve meaningfully?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I would hope it would decline some. But a portion of that, if you look, again, at Page 29, a portion of that is credit services. And that portion is actually what we pay every quarter anyway just the ongoing cost of putting new loans on the books. So that portion is not going to change very much. OREO, if you take a look at OREO costs, you've seen in the first half of the year, our OREO costs are a total of $1 million and that's not really going to be sustainable in the long term. You would expect that to come up a little bit. So while the other 2 components of our cyclical costs ought to come down some, there will be some upward pressure from OREO. In general, I would expect this to trend down a little bit, but I think that $325 million plus or minus is actually our attempt to give you some pretty good guidance.","William Henry Rogers","Yes. And remember, sort of pre-crisis, this number was sort of in the $200 million or $250 million kind of range, and it got up to about the $700 million range. So the $325 million was an attempt to try to figure out, the $325 million plus or minus as you defined it, was try to sort of figure out what's the new normal. I don't think the new normal will be pre-crisis. But clearly, we're trending down and I think the way Aleem described it, sort of, more annualized in the first half, seems to be that we're tracking towards what we talked about.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. Okay. And then, my second question is just about the mortgage business. And you guys are doing a really good job on the comp and benefits side, adjusting. I'm just wondering, how much have you already adjusted with your mortgage capacity versus how much you could -- you still have to adjust here relative to the ongoing changes in the origination environment. So again, kind of, what's already been adjusted to versus how much can you adjust further?","William Henry Rogers","Let me take a crack at that. As you mentioned, there is about 20% of the variable cost which are in the categories you primarily talked about, which are compensation and then, just sort of when you think about sort of normal kind of cost of appraisals, and those things that are just highly variable to activity. Now they do lag a little bit because of the lock and close. We booked a gain at -- book the gain at lock and we pay the comp at close, so it's got a little bit of lag. But the 20% sort of happens. I mean, that's part of the system. We made a conscious decision as we were building up -- and seeing what we had in the refi side, as we built up this time, we took about 25% to 30% of our cost and essentially, let's call it, outsourced it for lack of a better word, and we created more variability. So that cost, in the past, would have been more fixed cost on our books. It's now more of a variable cost. So several weeks ago, literally the day, I think when we started to see what was going on with rates, we started putting contingency plans in place to not only get those variable costs down, some of the fixed costs we converted to variable and then, putting plans in place to figure out what the actual fixed cost as well, have to -- have to come down. And those plans are already in place. I mean, we've already punched the button. I guess, if I were trying to summarize sort of how to think about it, if you think about sort of the new mortgage takes all the legacy out, at the higher gain on sale, we were originating the mortgage at about a 50% efficiency ratio, to sort of think about that at a high level. Now with sort of the changes in trying to -- with the lag and everything else, our goal will be, and I'm fairly confident we can see a path to this, we'll continue to originate mortgages in a way that is accretive to our current efficiency ratio. Maybe, does that help?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes. I guess, if you'd wrap it all together just on the expense comments, can expenses continue to come down from here, just in absolute terms?","William Henry Rogers","Total expenses or mortgage related?","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Total.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, total. So we were operating sort of at a total expense level, sort of, at $1.5 billion kind of handle to it. It now has a $1.3 billion handle to it, and that feels a lot better. So I have no intention of us going backwards from that standpoint. And we've committed to an efficiency ratio of 65%. And long term, we've committed to efficiency ratio of 60%. So some combination of revenue and expense, relativity is going to get us to that 60% efficiency ratio. So if we stay in this low-revenue environment, we're going to lower our expenses. Hopefully, with the initiatives that we've seen, changes in the rates, increase in NII, we'll be able to have some revenue component to add as well.","Aleem Gillani","Ken, when you think about what our expenses were last year or the year before, we were running at $6.2 billion in annualized expenses. If you look at where we've come in this year, we're running about $5.6 billion in annualized expenses. So we've taken $600 million of expenses out of the system so far, but we haven't stopped. There are going to be other opportunities. We're looking at other things. The focus of this management team remains intense.","William Henry Rogers","And also, that's sort of a natural. As expenses are coming down, they get annualized and actualized. So as they come down, they tend to have a natural momentum.","Operator","Our next question or comment comes from Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, first, maybe a question on the margin. Given the fact that the swap roll-off is no longer a headwind for the next couple of quarters and Aleem, you mentioned reinvestment yields are improving, I understand that we're going to be down a couple of basis points next quarter and then, we should stabilize for 4Q. Can you just help us understand what the path may be beyond 4Q? Has the rate environment improved enough such that reinvesting yields are greater and you can -- and we can now see some more stability to the margin? And I have a follow-up.","Aleem Gillani","Well, that's sort of a tough question, Ryan. There's a little bit of a crystal ball in here. I think the rate move that we saw was certainly nice, that the industry certainly needed it. So thank you, Mr. Bernanke. However, what the industry really needs is move up in short-term rates to take us back to the profitability levels that we enjoyed before the crisis. And while this is great and this will certainly help mitigate the overall decline in margin for the industry and for SunTrust, it's -- all this is, is a steep -- a somewhat steepening of the curve. We're certainly not back to normalized rate levels. And when you think about where the industry's net exposure is along the curve, it's generally much shorter as an industry than 10 years. So this is going to help somewhat. It's not going to be what we need to take us back to much higher net interest margin levels.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Aleem, if I could just add 1 follow-up. Just related to the swaps. I think the release mentioned that you did add some swaps in the quarter. Can you just remind us what the duration of the swap book is? And I think, also, according to the 10-Q, it says when rates rise, I think, 200 basis points, we should see NII rise 5.3%. Does that number take into account the impact of swaps rolling off? And if not, what would your asset sensitivity look like without that?","Aleem Gillani","Well, our asset sensitivity -- let me start with our asset sensitivity, at the end of the second quarter, is currently 1.3%, and that's based on 100-basis-point parallel shift. So that's an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel shift and how much our NII will go up as a result. The swap book duration at the end of the second quarter is 2.5 years. And the way the balance sheet is structured, we become more asset-sensitive every month, naturally, unless we do anything. So unless we take action, we're structured to become more asset-sensitive every month. As the swaps roll off over the course of the next 2.5 years, and some of them obviously are before that, you'll see us becoming more asset-sensitive over time.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Gerard Cassidy from RBC.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I may have missed it, but can you give us some color on your Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III increased very nicely in the quarter? And we saw that the risk weighted asset number fell, which was a driving factor. What drove the risk-weighted assets down?","Aleem Gillani","Under the Basel III calculations, Gerard?","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's correct.","Aleem Gillani","The new rules have changed pretty substantially from the previous proposal. And the effect of the new rules is for some that there were -- in the previous proposal, there were multiple tiers of risk weightings for mortgages, including 1 tier that was up to 200%. The new rules basically put all mortgages into 2 tiers, 50% and 100%. And as a result, doing sort of normal mortgages for normal clients doesn't require us to put up additional capital for regular mortgages, as well as, for home equity. And that's a big benefit for our portfolio. We also received additional benefits for our CRE exposure. I think what you ought to see is, across of the industry, you ought to see regional banks do better as a result of the new rule than money center banks. You ought to see regional banks do better than investment banks. And you want to see banks that have mortgage exposures do better than banks that don't have mortgage exposures.","William Henry Rogers","Relatively.","Aleem Gillani","Relatively.","Gerard S. Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. Great. And the second question is, coming back to the environmental cost, where you guys have indicated that around that $325 million is the new norm, down from $700 million, but up from, I think, you said 2.25 or 2.50. What's preventing the environmental cost from -- when we get to a normalized state and you can pick whenever that is, it may be a couple of years from now, but what prevents the environmental cost from actually getting back to the way they were pre-crisis?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think one of the things that I'm concerned about in general is, as a country, as an industry, have we trained consumers that it's okay to not repay debt? And is there going to be a higher incidence of default over time in the future than there has been in the past? That is one of the things I'm concerned about, and that's one of the things that's holding me back from saying that we're going to get back to the world that we once had.","William Henry Rogers","And I think, if you also just -- some of this, well, may also be our natural conservatism. So there may be some factor in there, but if you think about the cost of things. So think about the cost of collection and credit services under a different regulatory environment. And the requirements to meet different and more stringent standards, there's just some additional cost for that. Now how much that is, I don't think we also know. That hasn't leveled out yet. But the only the reason we say it's more than previous is there just really is embedded increased different cost of compliance that didn't exist before.","Aleem Gillani","Cost of service is likely to be higher, as Bill says...","William Henry Rogers","It's going to be.","Aleem Gillani","And there are likely to be higher set of repurchase demands from the GSE in the future than there have been in the past, and a longer duration. And now it also takes longer to resolve default and other issues than it used to. So Gerard, I think, directionally, you're right. But I'm not sure that we'll get back to that type of a number.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Brian Foran from Autonomous.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess, given the payout ratio this year, I know it's early to talk about next year's CCAR, but just remind us, you will be accreting capital lapse and a big change in the balance sheet growth outlook. And maybe kind of looking at a 10%-ish Basel III ratio next year. How are you thinking about the priorities beyond organic growth, which I'm sure is the first priority both now and in the future?","Aleem Gillani","You're right. Organic growth is absolutely #1.","William Henry Rogers","You're also right, it's early to talk about CCAR.","Aleem Gillani","But if what you're asking, Brian, is a CCAR question...","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","I guess, maybe I shouldn't have mentioned CCAR, just more the capital waterfall now that 6 months ago, we wouldn't have necessarily had you in the excess capital bucket. Now we've got you in a pretty big excess capital bucket, at least, on our numbers. And just remind us of what your waterfall is beyond that organic growth between dividends, buybacks, acquisitions, all that kind of good stuff?","Aleem Gillani","Acquisitions aren't really making the list, that's pretty low down. Organic growth is #1, meeting our clients' needs is always #1 for SunTrust. Beyond that, to the extent that we'll be able to grow dividend and buyback and return capital to our shareholders, obviously, that's going to be high on our list. And by the way, we're delighted to be able to start to do that this quarter for the first time in 6 or 7 years. So we're pretty happy about being on this side of the line. Never say never for acquisitions, I guess, but we've got so much opportunity, Brian, to run our company better and become more efficient, to focus on our clients and just do more business. That's really what we're focused on.","Brian Foran - Autonomous Research LLP","And then, just maybe 1 follow-up on the swaps, not to overkill the issue. But what's the reasoning -- so swaps versus MBS or swaps versus securities, I mean, the reasoning to add swaps, is it just more efficient from a balance sheet perspective? Or does that do other things for you as well?","Aleem Gillani","One of the things it does is that it's quick. When -- I said earlier that we're opportunistic in the way we did this, and we were able to add $2 billion in swaps right at the end of the quarter very quickly as rates moved up. So these swaps are efficient from a transactional perspective, both going in and going out. So that's helpful. They don't also affect earnings in a one-time way on the outlook. We sell securities and take a gain, that gain shows up immediately and then, requires an adjustment by everybody. Whereas, if we exited swaps, the gain in the swap just accretes in the income over the original life of the swap, and so it doesn't require a lot of sort of extra adjustments. I guess, one other point is that they are a really good hedge in the balance sheet for our commercial loans.","Operator","Our next question or comment is from Marty Mosby from Guggenheim.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Aleem, I wanted to walk through the mortgage banking segment income statement. You're showing a $76 million loss in the quarter. And what I was trying to do is think of, as you talked about the production coming down, you've already kind of, like you said, you do have locks so you've already got a lot of the gain on sale margin compression in there. But I think there's 3 other moving pieces that will, potentially, more than bring this to a breakeven. I think you've got the $72 million legal matter in this segment because that would be real estate-related. You've got the $28 million of incremental collection cost, and you also have suppressed servicing profitability as your, like you said, decay goes back to where it was. Even if you have your hedge about 0 or breakeven, your decay should improve by about $20 million. So in my mind, I'm just trying to map the $76 million to, at least, to break even in the short run, and these 3 moving pieces seem to kind of get me there. I just wanted to see what you thought about that.","Aleem Gillani","Marty, I think you got the direction right, but the numbers, perhaps, not exactly right. That legal matter wasn't as high as the $76 million. We referenced the legal matter as being sort of the primary driver for our overall increase in expenses, which were up $34 million. So the legal matter I would think about it in that context rather than the $76 million. The increase in operational expenses, credit expenses, was about 18. And I think you've mentioned a higher number just now. And over time, yes, I think directionally, you're also right on servicing. And servicing income ought to also come back, will also come back over time as we start to get less volatility again, and rates will help and as decays come down. So directionally, I think you're right on every one of those pieces. But the numbers you mentioned seem a little high to me.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, just a follow up on the servicing side. When you look at your net hedge performance, it's been favorable. And you mentioned the volatility being the driver of the negative that you saw going from -- what's been a $30 million to $40 million net positive, down to about breakeven. Are you using forward commitments, and is that mainly why you end up with a little more the volatility matter than if you were using interest rate swaps, which don't typically be -- aren't as related to the volatility in the marketplace. So I just was wondering, if we do see rates leveling back out, could even the net hedge performance improve from where it's at right now?","Aleem Gillani","Marty, I would think about it this way. MSR, as an asset, are inherently negatively convexed. So within MSR, we're naturally short volatility. So the hedging process requires that we buy volatility or offset that short volatility position. And it's cheaper to do that in any quarter when there is less volatility in the market. So and that's been the case as we have seen for the last year or so. This quarter, obviously, there was a lot of rate volatility in the market. And so just the cost of buying back that short volatility position went up. If, as you say, we head back to a more normal rate environment -- and it sort of doesn't really matter if it's going up or down as long as it's not volatile, the hedge ought to start to perform -- the outperformance we've had in the hedge ought to start to come back, yes.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just out of curiosity, the product you're using to get that convexity is a forward commitment? Is that -- what's the product you're using to hedge here?","Aleem Gillani","We've got some forwards, we've got futures, we've got swaps, we've got securities and we have options.","Marty Mosby - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Would swaps be a smaller part of that? I'm just trying to -- because typically, the swaps don't have the convexity and don't relate to the volatility, is what I'm trying to get at.","Aleem Gillani","You're exactly right. When we use swaps, we're using that for a duration hedge, not really a convexity hedge. And it's more options and forwards that will help us on the convexity side.","Operator","And our last question comes from Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Aleem, I just wanted to ask a question from Page 25 of the supplement, and the Corporate and Other page, where you say, where you lay out your interest income, interest rate sensitivity. It looks like it's down by a bit more than half from the first quarter numbers that you put on the same page. And I guess, I'm just curious if you can give a little color as to what's going on there? And how you're thinking about how that might change over the course of the next 3 to 6 months?","Aleem Gillani","Well, Matt, I think that's another crystal ball question. That depends on exactly what rates do, how steep the curve gets and whether short rates move at all. But in general, our asset sensitivity increases by -- and I'm going to round here, but it's about 0.1\/10 of 1% per month. So it will naturally go up unless we do something. What we did do in this quarter is we added some of those swaps. So the swaps that we added reduced our asset sensitivity some, but they also added $8 million a quarter to our interest income. And on Page 24 of the deck, when you look at the new swap income forecast, you'll see that that's flattened out pretty considerably now right into the middle of next year. So we added some surety as we took advantage of the higher rates that we saw in the second quarter, and that did make us a little bit less asset-sensitive in the short term. But that asset sensitivity will come back while we've added NII.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Let me ask a question about the non-mortgage lending business, if I can. Bill, you mentioned your increased level of confidence about commercial lending and potential loan growth in the second half of the year. Could you give us a little more color as to why you're feeling more confident about that? And are there any specific regions or products within C&I that are particularly fertile areas for loan growth?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, and I don't want to get over my skis on confidence, but I want to talk about the things that we do see. And if you sort of look at -- one of the bigger things that we look at, as I look at it, are our commercial pipeline. Our commercial pipeline was about equal to what it was at the end of the first quarter. But that's about 60% ahead of where it was at the end of 2012. So we're built -- so we're building a pipeline that's positive. In terms of the places where we've seen, to date, good activity, in the commercial side, our not-for-profit business has been really good. On the CIB side our energy business, I'm really happy to see things like -- that we've invested in, like asset-based lending, are starting to click in and provide some more activity. And then, related to the consumer side, production is up and we saw -- I don't -- maybe it's an inflection point, but we saw an inflection point on home equity that, that sort of finally stabilized. Remember, we have sort of been in a fully attriting mode on home equity over the last quarter, that sort of has stabilized. And production in home equity is really, really good. So it's mainly production and pipeline kind of things that I see, and those are all offset against continued deleveraging and other activities. And then, the final is CRE. And albeit off a smaller base, it's about $5 billion base. I mean, similar there, we hit an inflection point already. So at the last quarter, we hit an inflection point. We're now starting to be in a growth mode. And production there in the -- I guess, primarily, the institutional side has been good. From a region-by-region perspective, it's pretty evenly distributed, but we are seeing parts of our markets, take Florida, probably, as the largest example of the most recovery in the shortest period of time, which make us more optimistic as we see sort of state unemployment rates, again, particularly in areas that were way down, like Florida, which are now way up, and trending ahead of national numbers.","Mark Palmer - BTIG, LLC, Research Division","One of your competitors mentioned continued conservatism in the mid-market and small business sector. Is that consistent with what you're seeing as well?","William Henry Rogers","You mean, from the client perspective, continued conservatism?","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","William Henry Rogers","I think that's accurate. They continue to have a lot of cash, while there's lots of dialogue and conversation. But I think conservatism in that group, as defined, is an accurate statement.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, everyone, for joining us today, and we appreciate it.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to introduce Kris Dickson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to SunTrust's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us. In addition to the press release, we've also provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call today. The press release, presentation and detailed financial schedules are available on our website, www.suntrust.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","With me today, among other members of our executive management team, are Bill Rogers, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Aleem Gillani, our Chief Financial Officer; and Tom Freeman, our Chief Risk Officer.","Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments today may include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risk and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause the actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures in talking about the company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our press release and on our website. Finally, SunTrust is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized live and archived webcasts are located on our website. With that out of the way, I'll turn things over to Bill.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Kris. I'm going to begin this morning with a brief overview of the year and quarter, then Aleem is going to give more details on the results, and I'll wrap up the call with some perspective on our line of business performance. SunTrust made significant progress during the year on several fronts. Our core performance improved, driven by higher revenue with stable expenses. We also took definitive action to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our risk profile. Credit quality has improved significantly, and credit-related expenses are abating. All of these translated into better bottom line performance and improvement in our efficiency ratio. The solid core performance trends and earnings momentum we established earlier in the year continued throughout the fourth quarter and these are summarized on Slide 3. Most notable this quarter was strong noninterest income, driven by record investment banking quarter and continued mortgage strength, reduced expenses and favorable deposit and credit trends. These items, along with the lower provision for credit losses and tax rate, contributed to earnings per share of $0.65.","The diversity of our revenue stream continue to benefit us this quarter, as the strength in noninterest income more than offset a net interest income decline due to the impact of our previously announced loan sales. Adjusted expenses were lower from the prior quarter due to reduced compensation, along with the continued drop in credit-related expenses. Expenses were also down as compared to the fourth quarter of last year.","Now taking a look at the balance sheet. Overall, average performing loans were down modestly from the third quarter due to loan sales, but growth in targeted categories, particularly C&I, continued. Compared to last year, performing loans were up $4 billion or 3%, again, due to targeted loan growth driven by C&I.  The favorable deposit mix shift continued, with average DDA growth of 4% from the prior quarter and 16% from the prior year, while higher cost time deposits were down 5% and 18% respectively. From a credit perspective, nonperforming loans declined 11% from the last quarter, inclusive of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy related loan transfers that Aleem will detail shortly, and NPLs are down nearly 50% from last year.  Our capital position continued to increase, but our Tier 1 common ratio -- equity ratio estimated at 10%, up about 20 basis points from last quarter. So overall, we made significant progress this year as we endeavored to improve our overall risk profile, capitalize on revenue opportunities and improve our efficiency.","Now if you'll indulge me, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank the SunTrust teammates for all they did in 2012. We are united in our purpose of lighting the way to financial well being for our clients and communities, and our continued focus towards delivering upon our performance promise to our shareholders. So teammates, thank you.","Now I'm going to turn it over to Aleem to walk you through the details and give you more clarity on the quarter's results.","Aleem Gillani","Thanks, Bill. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'll begin with a review of the summary income statement on Slide 4. First, you will recall that our third quarter earnings per share of $1.98 benefited by $1.40 per share from the actions we announced in September. Therefore, the sequential quarter comparisons are somewhat skewed by the September transactions. However, I will provide transparency regarding the core trends on subsequent slides.","Looking at our bottom line, our earnings per share this quarter increased to $0.65, up from an adjusted $0.58 in the third quarter and continuing the increased core earnings trajectory that we've delivered in every quarter of 2012. As Bill noted, the highlights of this quarter included strength in noninterest income, continued credit quality improvements and lower noninterest expense.","These positive trends drove a strong finish to the year despite the negative impact to this quarter's earnings from the reclassification of consumer loans discharged from Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Current quarter results also benefited from a low effective tax rate due to year end true-ups and audit settlements.","For the full year, earnings per share were $3.59 or $2.19 after adjusting for the September announcement. This adjusted amount was still more than double our 2011 earnings level, driven by higher revenue, a lower provision as a result of improved credit quality and the reduction in preferred dividends due to the redemption of TARP.","Let's begin a more detailed review of the quarterly trends, starting on Slide 5. Net interest income declined sequentially by $25 million or 2%, primarily due to a reduction in earning assets from the loan sales we announced last quarter. As a reminder, those sales included $500 million of nonperforming loans, which was substantially completed during the third quarter, as well as about $2.5 billion combined of government-guaranteed student and mortgage loans, the majority of which were delinquent. As anticipated, we completed the remaining sales of these loans during the fourth quarter. The effect of these loan sales resulted in a decrease of approximately $15 million of the sequential quarter net interest income. The remaining reduction was largely due to a 5 basis point decrease in loan yields and a 10 basis point compression of securities yields,  which were a result of the ongoing low rate environment. This was partially offset by continued reductions in deposit rates, as well as lower average balances and rates paid on long-term debt, which collectively drove an 8 basis point decline in interest-bearing liability costs. These same trends explain the 2 basis point decrease in the net interest margin.","Relative to the prior year, net interest income declined by $48 million and the margin fell 10 basis points. Loan income was down about $90 million, as growth in the loan portfolio was offset by lower yields and a decline in commercial loan swap income. Investment securities income declined by $60 million due to 3 primary reasons: the size of the portfolio was somewhat reduced, reinvestment rates declined and the dividend on the Coca-Cola company stock was forgone after the third quarter transaction. Partially offsetting the lower interest income was a reduction in interest expense of about $100 million, driven by a favorable shift in the deposit mix, lower deposit rates and a decline in long-term borrowing costs of greater than 45%.","As we look to the first quarter of 2013, the full impact of the loan sales will be in the run rate. As I noted earlier, the sales reduced fourth quarter net interest income by about $15 million. Since they occurred throughout the fourth quarter, we'll have some additional loan sale related net interest income decline in the first quarter of approximately $10 million. On an interim basis, we've utilized the loan sale proceeds to reduce short-term borrowings. Over the coming months, we'll evaluate options to redeploy these proceeds into higher returning alternatives, which will help partially mitigate the net interest income impact. With regard to the first quarter net interest margins, we currently anticipate a decline on the order of mid-single digit basis points.","Slide 6 shows trends in noninterest income. Reported noninterest income declined sequentially due to the third quarter gain from the Coca-Cola transaction. However, adjusted noninterest income increased by $272 million to its highest level in over 2 years. The sequential quarter growth was driven by a $359 million reduction in the mortgage repurchase provision due to last quarter's increase in the mortgage repurchase reserve. We also had a record quarter in investment banking income, which was up $29 million sequentially, and was driven by strong syndicated finance and bond origination fees. Market conditions were conducive to debt financing, and we continue to gain share in our corporate investment banking business. Our mortgage production income remains strong overall, with production volume again around the $8 billion mark this quarter, split roughly 75:25 between refinance and purchase. However, we did experience some decline in margins from their unsustainably high third quarter levels. This was not surprising, as well as we saw some usual fourth quarter seasonality decline in loan applications.","Relative to the prior year, adjusted noninterest income increased by $262 million. Mortgage production income was up by over $300 million, roughly $200 million of which was from a lower mortgage repurchase provision and $100 million from higher core production income. Investment banking income also delivered strong growth, up by $25 million, again due to higher syndicated finance and bond origination activity. These increases were partially offset by a $21 million decline in other income due primarily to losses recognized in the fourth quarter from Ginnie Mae loan sales, which were incremental to the sales we announced last quarter.","Turning now to Slide 7 for a discussion of this quarter's trends in mortgage repurchases. Repurchased demands declined, which is consistent with the declining trend that we saw in full file requests in recent quarters. This quarter's demands were the lowest level experienced in 6 quarters, and the decline was most notable in 2007 originated loans, which as you know, has been the most troublesome vintage. Pending demands also declined modestly due to an increase in the pace of resolution.","Focusing on the reserve in the bottom left portion of the page. As expected, our reserve declined, following the increase we made throughout last quarter to reflect our estimate for incurred losses on the agreed 2009 GSE loans. The ending reserve was $632 million, and this quarter's provision of $12 million came in exactly on our previously stated expectations. Similar to several other bank's experience, Freddie Mac informed SunTrust that they plan to re-examine loans originated in 2004 and 2005, and they have already been making full file requests relating to these vintages. However,  of our 2004 and '05 loans sold to the GSEs less than 15% were sold to Freddie Mac, and we believe our existing reserve is already sufficient to cover any of their incremental demands relating to these years.","Let's move on to expenses on Slide 8. Adjusted expenses declined $27 million from the prior quarter. Employee compensation and benefits fell by $42 million, driven by lower salaries due to a decline in the number of full-time equivalent employees from the third quarter, a reduction in temporary labor costs and a one-time deferred compensation impact in the third quarter. Credit-related costs also declined with other real estate and collection service expenses down a combined $29 million or over 35%. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in outside processing, as well as seasonally higher advertising expenses. Relative to the prior year, adjusted expenses were down $60 million or 4%, driven by significant decline in credit-related expenses and operating losses. These cyclically high items were at their lowest combined level in almost 3 years, and we were pleased to have some real traction in their abatement over the course of 2012.","For the full year 2011, these costs were about $800 million, excluding the accrual for the national mortgage servicing settlement. In 2012, they declined to $650 million. This year, we expect further meaningful year-over-year declines in these costs.  Relative to the fourth quarter of last year, these reductions in cyclical costs were partially offset by higher outside processing. Reported employee compensation and benefits also increased due to the positive impact of onetime items last year. However, salaries declined $14 million due to a reduction in the number of full time equivalent employees.","As announced last week, SunTrust and 9 other mortgage servicers entered into an agreement in principle with the Federal Reserve and the OCC regarding the independent foreclosure review. SunTrust's cash portion of the settlement was $63 million. $32 million of this was recognized during the fourth quarter, which together with previous accruals, fully captures our expected cash expense for this matter. SunTrust's portion of the settlement also includes providing $100 million in relief to borrowers. We expect the costs associated with this relief to be substantially absorbed via our existing allowance for loan losses and other activities.  As we look to the first quarter for noninterest expense, I'll remind you that we will have the normal seasonal increase in employee benefits due to FICA and 401(k) resets, which typically amounts to about $40 million. Despite this increase, we do not currently expect our overall noninterest expenses to increase as compared to the fourth quarter.","Switching gears to the balance sheet. Average performing loans declined sequentially by $1.7 billion or 1%. This decline was driven entirely by the aforementioned loan sales, with guaranteed mortgage and student loans down by a combined $2.2 billion. Excluding the impact of the sales, loans were up modestly during the quarter. C&I increased 1% on an average balanced basis, driven by asset-based lending, not-for-profit and asset securitizations. Growth in C&I did pick up toward the end of the quarter and period end balances finished up 3% sequentially, in part due to an increase in utilization rates. Commercial real estate balances continued their decline this quarter. However, that was driven by our special assets division. CRE production continues to improve, and this is a business whose growth prospects we remain optimistic about for the future. Relative to the prior year, average performing loans were up $3.6 billion or 3%. C&I was again the driver, up by over $4 billion or 9%. Balanced growth came primarily from large corporate borrowers, and was widespread across industry verticals. Residential loans declined modestly as an increase in high credit quality, non-guaranteed loans was offset by declines in home equity and guaranteed mortgages. Conversely, consumer loans increased by $1 billion or 6%, primarily due to indirect auto, but also from strong growth, albeit from low basis in direct consumer and credit card.","A review of our credit trends begins on Slide 10. Credit trends continued their multi-quarter and now multi-year improvement. Delinquency ratios declined, driven by a 23 basis point reduction in non-guaranteed residential mortgages, which partially offset a modest increase in consumer loans due to normal seasonality. Nonperforming assets on loans also improved, both declining by 11% sequentially and driven by commercial loans. This nonperforming loan improvement occurred despite the fourth quarter reclassification to nonperforming status of $232 million of mortgage and consumer loans discharged as a result of Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Although the vast majority of these loans are current, we elected to make this policy change in order to align our accounting with others in the industry who are adopting this treatment as a result of guidance issued by the OCC. Partially offsetting the Chapter 7-related increase was the sale of an additional $160 million in nonperforming mortgage and CRE loans during the quarter. These sales were incremental to those we announced as part of our third quarter strategic actions.","Net charge-offs declined by $113 million this quarter. You'll recall the third quarter net charge-offs and loan loss provision included $172 million related to the nonperforming loan sales we announced in September and $65 million related to a junior lien policy change. The current quarter included $79 million in net charge-offs and loan loss provision due to the post-Chapter 7 bankruptcy change and $39 million from the additional nonperforming loan sales I mentioned. Adjusted for these policy changes in nonperforming loan sales, net charge-offs were relatively stable sequentially. In light of the ongoing improvement in credit quality, the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans declined by 4 basis points sequentially to 1.8%. Excluding government guaranteed loans, the ratio stood at 1.95% at quarter end.  SunTrust asset quality improved substantially throughout 2012, and was widespread across loan types.  Relative to year end 2011, delinquency ratios declined by approximately 20 basis points. Nonperforming loans fell by almost 50%, and net charge offs declined on a stated basis, and were markedly lower on a core basis.","Key credit metrics for both commercial and consumer loans now approximate normalized levels, while those for residential loans are still somewhat elevated by historical standards. Consequently, as we look into 2013, we expect the improvement in asset quality metrics to be primarily residential driven.  Focusing on the first quarter specifically, we expect nonperforming loans to continue to decline. Additionally, core net charge-offs are anticipated to be stable to down from fourth quarter levels, adjusted for the impacts of the Chapter 7 loan reclassification and nonperforming loan sales.","Let's take a look at our deposit performance. Average client deposits increased by $2.6 billion or 2% from the prior quarter, in part due to year end seasonality. The favorable shift in the deposit mix continued, as growth was driven entirely by lower cost accounts, most notably DDA, which was up $1.6 billion or 4%. Money market and NOW accounts also increased, while higher cost time deposits fell by 5%. The story, as compared to the prior year, is a similar one. Lower cost accounts increased over $6 billion, led by a $5.4 billion or 16% increase in DDA. Higher cost time deposits declined by over $3 billion or 18%. As I mentioned earlier in the context of our net interest income discussion, this mix shift, together with the reduction in deposit rates paid, has helped to mitigate some of the rate pressure that we and the industry have faced on the asset side.","Slide 12 provides information on our capital metrics. Tier 1 common capital expanded by approximately $300 million and the Tier 1 common ratio again increased up to an estimated 10%. Our estimate for the Basel III Tier 1 common ratio, assuming that all the components of the Federal Reserves recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are implemented in their current form, is 8.2%. As shown at the bottom of the page, the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share both increased somewhat, driven by increased earnings and partially offset by lower other comprehensive income.","With that, I'll turn things back over to Bill to cover the last couple of slides.","William Henry Rogers","Okay. Thanks, Aleem, and before we move into Q&A, I want to point out some of the highlights from a segment perspective and that will start on Slide 13. In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, loan production was up 13% over the prior year, and that was driven by good mix from home equity, consumer direct and indirect auto. Furthermore, their favorable deposit trends continued, as DDA grew 20% from the prior year. Additionally, we maintained our industry-leading loyalty and service in our branches, which provides the path to help deepen our client relationships and meet more client needs. We're also committed to operating more efficiently, while expanding our penetration of existing relationships. The fact that clients are increasingly utilizing self-service channels has provided the opportunity to make some changes to both our staffing model and retail branch network without compromising service levels. Our wholesale business overall had a really strong year, hitting record net income levels. Net income is double what it was a year ago, reflective of both improved operating performance and credit improvement.","Revenue was up 8% to $3.4 billion. Capital markets revenue was up by more than 20%, led by several corporate investment banking, industry verticals, notably energy, media and communications, but also, as well as by leveraging our CIB product base and expertise to meet more needs of our core commercial clients. Wholesale's year-over-year revenue growth was also driven by higher net interest income due to loan and deposit growth, which were both up 7% year-over-year. This revenue growth, coupled with a year-over-year 4% decline in total expenses, led a significant improvement from an efficiency standpoint, with this segment's efficiency ratio declining from 65.3 in 2011 to 57.5 in 2012. Furthermore, strong performance drove the fourth quarter efficiency ratio slightly under 50%.  While mortgage banking reported a net loss for 2002, its core trends were much improved and the future prospects for this business are very sound. Production volume was up $9 billion or nearly 40% and despite a higher repurchase provision, 2012 revenue increased 42%.","Excluding the impact of the mortgage repurchase provision, core origination income was up $573 million, more than double what it was in 2011. The elevated levels of refinance activity have certainly benefited the business in 2012. While that is going to abate at some point and we may see some additional margin declines, we do expect the current favorable mortgage market to remain certainly for the near term. There are a lot more clients that can benefit from refinancing. The purchase market is improving and so is the overall housing market. Given our markets and business model, I think we're uniquely well-positioned to benefit from this. We're also positioning this business for the longer term. For example, we're continuing to devote resources to purchase activity, which represented 23% of our fourth quarter production. On the efficiency side, we're focused on expanding our presence in lower-cost channels and optimizing our channel selection to maximize the long-term profile of this business. We have a diverse business mix that benefit us and will continue to do so going forward. Over the past year, we saw the firming up of several core trends in our lines of businesses, as we continue to grow, while also improving efficiency.","If you turn to Slide 14, I think you can see some of these favorable trajectories. Many positive trends emerged during 2012, with each quarter building up on the successes from the prior and combining to drive meaningful improvement in our bottom line. The earnings improvement over this time frame was driven first by revenue gains, specifically fee income, and secondarily, by ongoing credit improvement. We're starting to see tangible evidence of the progress that we've been making in both revenue and expenses. If you look back at the second quarter of 2011, which is when we really began our efforts in earnest to driving efficiency improvements. Our revenue was about $2.2 billion per quarter and our expenses were above $1.5 billion. Relative to those figures, our core revenue in recent quarters is up about $100 million per quarter, while our expenses have actually come down a bit. So we're driving growth and positive operating leverage and this, of course, is improving the bottom line and our efficiency ratio, which I think is really evident at the bottom of this page.","Now with that, I'll turn it over to Kris, and we'll start taking some questions.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, Bill. Wendy, we're ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kevin St. Pierre with Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Question on the credit-related expenses, Slide 25 in the appendix, if I look at those, you had -- if we look at operating losses excluding your settlement charge, seem to be down significantly to, say, $45 million, a big decline in OREO expenses in the quarter. Is that -- can we use that, adjust for the settlement charge and make that a new base and expect a continued decline? Or how do we think about those expenses going forward?","Aleem Gillani","Kevin, yes, I think that this -- take a look at this number, and we do expect to see continued improvement in this quarter as we get improvement over the year as we go through 2013. If you look at the total, you'll recall what we've been saying for a while is that we think 2011 was the peak in these costs at about $800 million per year. And prior to going into the financial crisis, we were running more like $200 million or $250 million a year. After peaking at $800 million this year, we're now down to $650 million. I don't think we'll actually go back to that run rate of $200 million to $250 million before the financial crisis, but we're headed down toward a much lower number from $650 million, and we think we'll see some of those benefits in '13 again.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then the actual net charge-offs have been bouncing around a bit based on the NPL sales and change in policy. Your guidance or outlook for stable to down net charge-offs next quarter, kind of sticking in this 90 basis point to 1% range, any reason we shouldn't expect that those trend down significantly over 2013?","Aleem Gillani","Well, that depends a little bit on the economy and how the economy goes in 2013. But if you'll think about net charge-offs as sort of an adjusted number, about $280 million last quarter and this quarter, 3 and 4. I think if you take that $280 million as the base of looking to Q1, you'd expect that number to be stable to down some.","Thomas E. Freeman","Yes, it's Tom Freeman. I think as you continue to see delinquencies improve and the overall credit quality organization improve, I think you're establishing a base now at the number Aleem was talking about. And as long as delinquencies continue to improve, I think you'll see charge-offs continue to improve over an extended period of time.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","C&I lending, we saw a lot of your competitors have released on a national basis, more so on a regional basis, see some very strong broad-based C&I lending. Just wondering, is it -- are you seeing more activity in your markets on that front?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, this is Bill, and I think Aleem also pointed out what we really started seeing is actually that's building up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. If you look at sort of our core commercial, November was a lot better than October and December was a lot better than November. So we started seeing some build there towards the end of the quarter. So I'm pretty bullish on C&I, again, sort of seeing the trends that we're looking at, looking at the pipelines. All that being said, there is a little pull of uncertainty. So while the pipelines continue to be strong, our pull-through rates continue to be a little bit better. Our drawdown rates actually have gone -- have been a little bit improved this quarter, and that's actually different than actually the several prior 8 quarters. I think if we can get a little relief for the safety valve, we'll see C&I take off fairly well.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just a really quick follow-up, on your mortgage banking side, can -- do you disclose how much of your HARP is -- your production is HARP-related?","William Henry Rogers","Well, it's 15% in the fourth quarter.","Aleem Gillani","Paul, just as a follow-up, we've been running on HARP of the 75% of refi. About 25% of the 75% has been HARP.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is that declining or staying relatively stable because I know some people have mentioned that they burned through the most of their HARP eligible loans?","William Henry Rogers","Yes -- no, the -- I mean, every cloud has a silver lining. I mean, we have a HARP eligible environment in which we operate. Ours has been fairly stable in that sort of 15% to 17% range here in the last couple of quarters. And if you look out, I mean, we talked about this at the end of the quarter, I mean, we've got sort of 5x our quarterly run rate in terms of eligibility. That can change, housing prices increase, eligibility changes and those kinds of things, but we see a multi-quarter run rate still for us in HARP. As a matter of fact, we're intensifying our efforts on HARP.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Bill, can you provide some more commentary just on your outlook for the mortgage business, particularly the past gain on sale spreads and just given how much HARP volume you still have that you alluded to? And I guess just secondly on the mortgage business, are you seeing capacity coming back into the market and how are you expecting this to evolve over the next few quarters?","William Henry Rogers","Okay, I'll try to get them all there, Ryan. If I miss one, come back to me. But in sort of how we look at the business overall, I think if you think about for us specifically in terms of opportunity, we're seeing our housing markets recover. We have been, I think, doing the right things in keeping a lot of purchase capacity into our business. You sort of think about a quarter of our business is purchase. We've had a good history of that. So as we start to see that market rebound, we'll start to see more activity from there. And as I've said before, we've got 4x to 5x our quarterly run rate in HARP opportunity. So I think we have more run rate there. We're building more capacity, I can say that. So we're building more capacity into our system, and we're also becoming a heck a lot of more efficient as I talk about. So while we'll see -- yet we see some margin decline, I'll talk about that in a minute. Some of it's going to be offset by just the efficiency of our own operation. That has a lot to do with channel selectivity and productivity and other things that we've been doing over the last year. In terms of gain-on-sale margin, the third quarter for us was really unusually high. I mean, we really reached some rarified air on gain on sale margin in the fourth quarter. It was down probably about 15% or so. Will we see continued gain on sale margin to be under a little bit of pressure, I think so. If I look at the first 2 weeks or 2.5 weeks of the year, things are looking pretty good. I mean, our add volume really sort of jumped back up pretty significantly in January. It fell off a lot in the last 2 weeks of the year, which I think has a seasonal impact, but jumped back pretty significantly. So certainly, for this -- what I can see in the short term, I'm still pretty optimistic about our other opportunities in mortgage.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just as a follow-up, as we think about later in the year or maybe even -- or as we move into 2014, can you talk about how much of the expense base in the mortgage business is variable? So if we were to get 15%, say, 15% to 20% decline in applications at some point, what do you think the change in expenses would look like?","William Henry Rogers","Yes, there certainly are variable costs. They tend to lag by a quarter or so, sort of depending on whether it's purchased or depending on whether it's refinanced in terms of the length of pull through rate, and so I'm confident certainly based upon what we've done in the past and our ability to regulate our variable cost. Ours is going to be unique also and that our fixed costs are coming down. Our fixed costs on the credit side are actually coming down fairly significantly as well. So if the market changes out in end of '13, end '14, I'm fairly confident we can react from a variable standpoint, but you're also going to be seeing some of the fixed cost come down.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Maybe you could just provide a little more thoughts on the NIM kind of looking out for the rest of year. I think you talked about mid-single-digit decline in the first quarter and there's always some seasonal quarks there. But just as you think about the rest of the year, maybe loan growth picking up a little bit, how does all that kind of filter through into the net interest margin?","Aleem Gillani","Matt, well, we do expect to see some modest NIM compression throughout the full year, as long as rates stay where they are. So if we do stay in this for the long low-rate environment, of course, our maturing fixed-rate assets will be reinvested at lower rates and there is less capacity now for us to reprice on the liability side. So we've actually been pretty successful until now on being able to reprice liabilities both in terms of long-term debt, as well as deposits with the recent quarter, us being able to match the 8 basis point decline in asset yields, with an 8 basis point decline in liability cost. I think that as we look out to '13, there will be less capacity for us to do that on the liability side as we're getting toward terminally low rates on liabilities. If you look at year-over-year, '12 relative to '11, our NIM was down 10 basis points, full year to full year. And as I think about '13, I don't see any reason or a substantial change from that.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, I know there was some moving pieces in the loan buckets with some loan sales, nonperforming sales, but if we look at period end loan growth, it was in aggregate just up a little bit. Any thoughts on -- I mean, commercial is good, but net-net, was up just a little bit. Any thoughts on just loan growth this year and what it might take to get a pickup?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I would expect loan growth to actually be positive this year. As Bill pointed out, we did see some nice increase in loan growth toward the end of 2012, and we're pretty optimistic about '13. As you know, we've clearly got the capacity. We've got the capital to go. We've got the liquidity to go, and we're happy to service our client needs. So any chance that we can get to deliver appropriate services to our clients, we're going to be ready to be there for them, and I do expect to see some loan growth from us in '13, and we'll need to do that to offset some of those NII declines that we'd be expecting otherwise.","William Henry Rogers","And you're starting to see, Matt,  some of the headwinds for us start to run off. I mean, think about sort of our high-risk portfolio, which has been a headwind, it's been coming down by sort of $0.5 billion a quarter. Take CRE sort of like specifically, maybe this will be a little bit of a microcosm as  our outstandings were down $1 billion over the course of the year. That was primarily, well, almost exclusively, from our sad part of our business. Our production was about double that. The current outstandings in that set are about $600 million. So they're not going to run -- they're not going to have as much of that headwind, going forward, and we'll start to see the impacts of the production. Same thing is true with home equity and I've talked with the production there. So a lot of the headwinds we're starting to see now behind us, and I think we'll start seeing more the benefits of the production.","Operator","Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you give us a little more color on the decline in the comp expense in the quarter? How much -- what was the size of that deferred comp impact? And then, also, the $40 million seasonal increase in comp expense you expect for the first quarter, is that going to be off of this lower base in the comp expense line coming out of this quarter?","Aleem Gillani","So the third quarter impact you're talking about was a $13 million item. That was a vesting of accelerated benefits for a particular business line. As we look forward now from here, I do expect overall comp to be going down. If you look at our total cost base, half of it comes from comp, and so that's in an area on which we're intensely focused, and we're doing a lot to make sure that we align comp with performance in every one of our segments in every one of our functions. I would expect, as you look to '13, that overall comp is going to look better. Particularly, if you look at it less from a line item basis and more from an efficiency ratio perspective, if we have the ability to add comp, but at the same time add revenue, we're always going to take that alternative. So while we are focused on comp, we're also more focused on the efficiency ratio and trying to get whatever benefits that we can get to deliver more to the bottom line that way.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. So that $40 million in seasonality you expect for the first quarter of '13 should come off of this low base, coming out of this quarter?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, that $40 million is -- that's sort of a one quarter item, first quarter of every year, as FICA numbers go back up, 401(k) plans all reset and the company contributes to our teammates' 401(k) plan primarily in the first quarter of every year. But from then on, yes that ought to reset that.","William Henry Rogers","Yes, that is not evident to change in our strategy or trajectory.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then secondly, on the investment banking revenue, can you just give us a little color what drove it again, if you can give some indicated syndications? But also, how sustainable, more importantly, that item should be in the coming quarters?","William Henry Rogers","The good news is it came from a lot of places. I mean, we talk about syndications, but it also came from high-yield and high-grade. It came from M&A. It came from our asset securitization parts of our business. So the growth in the quarter really was the fact that a lot of cylinders hit versus one cylinder hit really well. So I think it's a sustainable question. Every quarter is going to be a little more volatile. First quarter investment banking is typically not your best quarter. But based upon sort of what we've seen, the momentum we've built, if you look at us on a multi-quarter basis, I mean, this has got really good momentum, and it's very diverse and very deep.","Aleem Gillani","John, I wouldn't be surprised if we a saw slight decline in Q1, as we think maybe some of our Q1 business might have been pulled forward a little bit into Q4, as our clients tried to get ahead of year end on some transactions. But outside that, this is a business where we're growing substantially and we're growing market share well. So overall, I think this is a sustainable and growing and scalable business.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to follow-up on just -- on the expense topic again. So a quick confirmation, when you guys are talking about expenses in the first quarter being no different than flat, that's just the reported number, $1.51 billion, correct?","Aleem Gillani","That is exactly correct. So you know we're expecting a $40 million increase in one line item, but there are going to be enough offsets throughout, but I think our total number will not go up.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. Well, certainly, you've got the $32 million settlement in there as well. And that was going to be my second question is what else comes out of the run rate as you look forward? How much were you spending on quarterly consent order costs underneath the one-time settlement?","Aleem Gillani","We have been spending on the order of $10 million to $15 million on those consulting costs per quarter. That number -- at least some of that will still exist in the first quarter. It won't all come out, but I think as you look out from partially Q1 and then all of it starting Q2 onward.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just -- then to continue the conversation about environmental expenses and the trajectory post the first quarter, what kind of line of sight can you give us on ongoing improvement environmental expenses and as well as progress you can make on your prior comments about taking -- moving the efficiency ratio?","Aleem Gillani","I think our efficiency ratio improvements, we're working on improving that from sort of several line items, not just that one. Comp is obviously one. Real estate cost is another. We're working to become more efficient in the way we handle our real estate footprint. We're working with several of our vendors and supplier partners to rationalize our use of some of their services and pricing there. So I think there's several different types of line items that we're working on to try and bring our efficiency ratio down. One of those areas will be some of these credit-related costs and after seeing that $150 million reduction in '12 versus '11, I think we ought to see in '13 a further reduction in that number and I wouldn't be surprised if that's an additional 8-figure reduction.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then so if you put all that together, is it fair to say that even after the first quarter kind of keeping it flat that we should see expenses continue to track down directionally just even if there's some underlying spending to the points you're making about how much tighter you're being on finding more costs to take out?","William Henry Rogers","I think the answer to that's yes, but as -- obviously, but as it gets to the credit related, it's just as you get down to these numbers quarter-by-quarter, it's just hard to make a commitment because -- and you've seen that trend while they're trending $800 million to $650 million, and we think clearly at a lower run rate in '13. It's just hard to commit quarter-by-quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeffrey Harralson with KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just want to do one quick follow-up on that expense line, just to make sure I'm thinking about it right. The -- you take the $1.51 billion and take out the 40, for ongoing quarters, you're at $1.47 billion, you have probably, I don't know, at some point anyway $60 million a quarter at least coming out in environmental types of costs, and all that's probably offset by some core growth in there. So maybe the base is, I don't know, if you want to think about $1.4 billion being a base, but that's sort of the base that we're working off of, x credit-related costs, is that -- am I thinking about that generally correctly?","Aleem Gillani","That's your model, Jeff. I think that's an interesting one. You might want to talk with Kris about how he sees that.","Operator","Our next question is from Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just had a quick question. Aleem, you mentioned that you expect about 10 basis points of compression over the next 4 quarters. So after the 5 basis points this quarter, obviously, it implies that it's pretty flat for the remaining of the year. Does that include the impact of the swap continuing to roll off on the commercial book?","Aleem Gillani","Erika, maybe I wasn't clear on that 10 basis points. I was looking at that as a year-over-year number, not a fourth quarter run rate number. From '11 to '12, our overall NIM dropped 10 basis points and what I'm thinking is from '12 to '13, we might see that type of decline again as long as rates stay where they are. If you look at the swap book, we do have some swaps rolling off in Q2 and Q3 this year. And as they roll off, we're not able to replace those swap deals, that might be in addition to the NIM decline we just talked about.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And could you give us a sense of how much that would impact if you can't replace those swaps?","Aleem Gillani","I think the amount of NII rolling off in Q2 and Q3 from the swaps, Erika, is on the order of about $25 million or $30 million.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just wanted to sneak one last one as a follow-up to Ryan's question. You mentioned that your production volume on the mortgage side continues to be quite strong, but you're seeing a little bit of softening, as is everybody on the gain on sale margin. If your mortgage banking revenues are trickling down because of gain on sale, not because of production, how much variable cost can come out in that scenario?","Aleem Gillani","Well, I think when you look at our variable cost in that segment, I think they're pretty similar to what I'm seeing around the rest of the industry. Our variable costs are arranged somewhere between 25% and 40% of the total cost base in mortgage. I'd look at that, but I'd also remake Bill's point. We're -- that mortgage segment for us is becoming increasingly efficient. We're just running it better. We're operating it better. And as we're doing that, our fixed costs are also declining as we're working through the set of improvements we're making.","Operator","Our final question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Since I get 1 question, it will have 7 parts. Housing, I was wondering if you could just touch on some of the trends you're seeing by market, particularly in Georgia, since it seems pretty clear Florida has already turned, unless you disagree with that. And then two, if you think there's any meaningful impact from the new CFPB rules around servicing or if they're just codifying what you and others are already doing?","William Henry Rogers","Let me take housing first. I think you said it, I mean, clearly, Florida, we're really seeing nice improvement and when I was asked this question 3 or 4 quarters ago, we would have talked by zip code. Then we would have talked by county, and now we're really talking by markets and by state. So we're really starting to see sort of a universal improvement. And in some places like South Florida, it's actually sort of fairly dramatic in terms of what we're seeing.  Georgia, I think, Atlanta being the primary part of Georgia, we're starting to see again some improvement. It's starting to ease back up. Atlanta, in fairness, was lagging a little bit, but now we're starting to see some of that increase. It now is like by description more of a county by county kind of increase, and I would assume that it would follow the same kind of trend that I talked about before. Now the rest of the state is okay. Pockets are better than others, but the rest of the state's okay. Some places, Savannah and those kind of places, are doing pretty well. Other places are -- didn't go down as far, and they won't come back as far. As it relates to the CFPB and the servicing, I think it really does and I think what you said is really right. I mean, we've been obviously anticipating this for quite a while and have put, I think, a lot of the infrastructure in place to make sure that we respond. Might there be some small marginal expense related to that? Maybe. But I think that's more of a small issue in that it really just does solidify some of the discussion. And fortunately, the investments we've been making have been extremely consistent with that announcement.","And just a quick comment before we wrap up the call today. I really believe we've built a strong foundation from which we'll be able to continue to grow and leverage the momentum we've generated. Our team is engaged. We're starting to see meaningful progress in their efforts. We're building a more effective and efficient company. The intensity across this organization is real and it's coupled with the right focus, and I think you're starting to see the real bottom line improvements. And I look very forward to updating you on our progress in 2013, and thank you.","Kris Dickson","Thanks, everybody, for joining us.

I will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and then I am going to turn it over to Aleem for additional details including our results within the consumer and wholesale segment. I'll conclude with some perspectives on how this quarter's performance fits into our long-term strategy and investment thesis in addition to sharing some perspectives on our purpose and outlook for the future.","We reported $1.03 of earnings per share this quarter, which is up 10% year-over-year. Overall I'm pleased with the results we delivered this quarter. Our performance is a testament to our ability to delivery on the commitments we've made to our owners. First, our focus on optimizing the balance sheet and business mix resulted in improve net interest margin and enabled us to deliver 2% year-over-year revenue growth despite the continued market pressures in mortgage.","Second, improving efficiency remains a key priority across the company and our strong execution this quarter resulted in a tangible efficiency ratio of 60.6% which keeps us on track to meet our goal of improving our efficiency ratio for the sixth consecutive year and creates capacity for strategic investments in growth.","Third, our ongoing commitment to maintaining underwriting discipline has resulted in consistently strong asset quality which not only benefits our profitability, but also enabled us to deliver on our commitment of growing capital returns. And as most of you are aware the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2017 capital plan which calls for a 54% increase in the dividend and a 38% increase in share repurchases, thereby keeping us on track to increase capital returns for the sixth consecutive year.","Now getting into the specifics, this quarter we delivered 1% sequential revenue growth driven by higher net interest income as a result of a five basis point increase in the net interest margin. This more than offset the decline in noninterest income which was higher than the first quarter as a result of investment banking's record performance. Momentum across our entire wholesale segment remained strong with the business delivering record revenue and net income in the second quarter.","As anticipated, expenses decreased sequentially driven primarily by seasonal decline in employee benefits related cost in addition to good expense control across the company. The efficiency improvements we've made also enabled us to deliver on our commitment to investing in growth across the company. Our ongoing investments and consumer lending initiatives such as LightStream and credit card drove solid loan growth this quarter.","Similarly our long term investments in SunTrust Robinson Humphrey continued to yield results evidenced by the 17% year-over-year growth in investment banking. Asset quality continues to be an area of strength of the company evidenced by the 12 basis points decline in net charge-offs to multiyear low of low of 20 basis points. This performance can be attributed to our focus on maintaining a diverse high-quality balance sheet and consistent underwriting discipline. This perspective is shared by the Federal Reserve CCAR process where our loss rates and severely adverse economic scenarios are much below as compared to other banks, a relative position where we've been consistently at the bottom for the last four years.","Big picture, the course we set on five years ago has us performing at a higher level and puts us in a position of strength for the remainder of this year and beyond.","And with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Aleem to provide some more detail on this quarter's performance.","Aleem Gillani","Thank you, Bill. Good morning everybody. We appreciate it is a busy day for you today, so we appreciate you joining our call. Let's move to Slide 4, where as Bill indicated our net interest margin improved 5 basis points driven by higher loan yields primarily as a result of the increase in contractual short-term rates, but also due to continued improvements in our loan mix. Net interest income increased 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as a result of the higher net interest margin and milder returning asset growth.","Looking to the third quarter, we expect the net interest margin to be between 314 and 316 which would represent a sequential NIM expansion that is lower than the second quarter increase. This is driven by an anticipated increase in deposit betas which tend to lag the increase in short-term rates. There are also other factors such as potentially higher premium amortization expense which typically lagged the decline in long-term rates and day count. We will continue to manage through a moderately asset sensitive balance sheet while also being cognitive of opportunities to add durations as and if the yield curve steepens.","Moving to Slide 5, you will see that noninterest income declined by $20 million sequentially primarily as a result of the record investment banking performance we delivered in the previous quarter. This is the third best quarter for investment banking, a great testament to the success that our teammates in CIB and the broader wholesale segment are having in strengthening client relationships and taking market share.","Mortgage production income was stable sequentially as a decline in salable volume was offset by slightly higher gain on sale margins. Compared to the prior year, production income declined 55% due to the lower refinancing activity and lower margins. Mortgage servicing income was down $14 million sequentially as a result of lower net hedge performance in addition to higher decay expense. The higher decay expenses due to the fact that the MSR asset has significantly increased in value in the previous few quarters and thus incoming cash flow creates a larger level of decay expense all things being equal.","Lastly, as a reminder, much of the year-over-year decline in noninterest income is due to the $44 million in net asset related gains recognized in the second quarter of last year. In addition to the impact of post moderate changes which were implemented in the fourth quarter of last year.","Let's move on to Slide 6, noninterest expense decreased $77 million this quarter driven primarily by the seasonal decline in personnel expense in addition to ongoing efficiency initiatives. We achieved our goal of closing 6% of branches in the first half of 2017 in line with the objective we articulated in January. We are continuously evaluating opportunities to further optimize our branch network which will in part allow us to fund additional investments in digital channels to satisfy evolving client preferences.","Compared to prior year our expense base grew 3% which is a reflection of several factors that somewhat mask the strong cost control we demonstrated in the second quarter. First, expenses from the Pillar & Cohen business we acquired in December which is efficiency dilutive but return accretive. Second, higher compensation costs in connection with strong revenue growth and our ongoing investments in talent. Third, higher FDIC premiums which stepped up in the third quarter of last year, and finally the reduction of amortized gains from prior sale leaseback transactions which also begin impacting occupancy costs in the third quarter of last year.","While quarter-to-quarter our expense base has and will vary, we continue to maintain a high focus on expense discipline so that we can also make the requisite investments to serve our clients.","Moving to Slide 7, you see the tangible efficiency ratio for the quarter was 60.6% which is down meaningfully relative to the first quarter and up 50 basis points compared the prior year. When considering the $44 million of net asset related gains we benefited from in the second quarter of last year, combined with the recent headwinds I discussed on the prior slide, the core efficiency progress year-over-year is strong. This strength combined with our positive revenue momentum and the ongoing efficiency initiatives we have underway enables us to remain on track to meet our goals of having a tangible efficiency ratio between 61% and 62% for this year and sub- 60% by 2019.","Take a look at Slide 8, our asset quality metrics improved further this quarter, evidenced by the 12 basis point decline in net charge-offs and three basis point decline in nonperforming loans. The low levels of net charge-offs reflect the relative strength we're seeing across our C&I portfolio. Performance we're extremely pleased with, but we remain cognizant that there will be both lumpiness and normalization going forward.","Given the strength of our asset quality performance in the first half of the year, we now expect an improved net charge-off ration for the full year somewhere between 25 to 35 basis points. Separately we continue to expect a relatively stable allowance level and therefore a provision expense that generally approximates net charge-offs.","Let's take a look at the balance sheet. Average loans increased 1% sequentially primarily due to growth in consumer lending. On a year-over-year basis average performing loans grew $3.4 billion or 2% with growth driven by consumer lending and commercial. In particular our targeted investments in LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are driving solid loan growth and also improving our return profile.","Commercial loan balances have been relatively stable, which is the net result of two different trends. In corporate and investment banking paydowns have been elevated over the past two quarters, reflective of the fact that we have helped these clients access the strong capital markets and our focus on ensuring that we have the appropriate relationship returns. On the other hand loan growth in our commercial banking business is improving and it is broad based reflective of solid economic trends and the differentiated value proposition we are increasingly providing these clients.","Going forward as clarity on various policy fronts develops we believe our clients will be ready to invest and we are extremely well positioned to meet their needs whether via lending, capital markets or other solutions.","Turning to deposits, average client deposits were stable sequentially and up 3% year-over-year with growth across most products and businesses. Period end balances were down 2% in part due to seasonal trends with bonuses and tax refunds received in the first quarter and tax payments and spending in the second, but also due to our decisions to forego raising deposit rates for certain corporate clients.","The strong deposit growth we have produced over the past several years in addition to our access to low-cost funding enables us to prudently manage our funding base and therefore more effectively manage deposit betas. Over time deposit betas will normalize. Nonetheless, we will continue to keep our focus on maximizing the value proposition for our clients outside of rate paid by meeting more of our client's needs via strategic investments in talent and technology.","Slide 11 provides an update on our capital position. As Bill noted, the Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted in conjunction with the 2017 CCAR process and our relative performance within that bank group continues to be strong. This is most notably evidenced by SunTrust consistently having amongst the lowest levels of loan losses in a severely adverse economic scenario relative to other CCAR banks. Our performance reflects the significant and cumulative actions we've taken over the past six years to derisk our balance sheet and improve the quality of loan production.","The capital plan includes a share buyback program of up to $1.32 billion over the coming four quarters. We will also increase our annual common stock dividend from a $1.04 to $1.60 subject to board approval. In total this represents a 41% increase in capital return relative to our previous - a meaningful benefit for our owners. In addition, our current dividend yield of 2.9% is now at the high end of our peer group.","This increase in capital return combined with issuances of preferred stock including the $750 million we issued in May will optimize our overall capital structure and help drive us towards a CET1 ratio below 9%, thereby improving our return on tangible common equity. The May issuance resulted in $6 million of increased preferred dividends in the second quarter and the whole $9 million dividend will begin in the third quarter.","Moving to the segment overviews, let's begin with the new combined consumer segment on Slide 12 where we continued to deliver healthy overall business and revenue momentum. Our 2% sequential revenue growth was driven largely by net interest income which was up 3% and 7% year-over-year as a result of strong loan and deposit growth in addition to continued improvements in loan mix.","Our targeted investments in consumer lending are consistently yielding good results, evidenced by the 1% sequential and 4% year-over-year increase in average loans. When extracting the declines in residential related lending, other consumer loan balances are up 14% year-over-year, which is meaningful in both the context of the company's overall growth and return profile.","Noninterest income was stable sequentially and down 13% year-over-year driven entirely by lower mortgage related revenue offset by solid trends in card fees and wealth management. Within wealth particularly we're pleased with the improved momentum we have developed. Wealth management related revenue is beginning to stabilize and grow slightly. This is a reflection of our client first focus and continued improvement in capabilities, resulting in our ability to attract and retain top talent and grow AUM.","Noninterest expense was down 4% sequentially as a result of the seasonal declines in benefits and was up 1% year-over-year. When considering the year-over-year comparison includes higher net occupancy costs and higher FDIC premiums, core expense management was strong. That being said, we continue to see opportunities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our consumer segment.","As a reminder we integrated mortgage with consumer and private wealth management at the beginning of April to create the new consumer segment. As we noted last quarter, the goal is to create a more consistent, integrated and improved experience for our clients across all consumer products and services, somewhat akin to the integrated ecosystem Mark Chancy and his leadership team developed in our wholesale segment. While we were only three months in, we are pleased with the initial progress and teammates are optimistic about the opportunities we have to improve the client experience and therefore deliver more growth for our clients and owners.","Moving on to wholesale on Slide 13, we delivered yet another record revenue quarter due to strong execution across all lines of business and favorable market conditions. Net interest income was up 3% sequentially and 13% compared to the prior year, driven primarily by improvements in the net interest margin.","Average loan balances were down sequentially and stable year-over-year as our solid core production has been offset by recent elevated pay downs. In many cases, a trend we are very comfortable with as our focus is overall returns, not just loan growth. Average deposits were also down sequentially given our intentional discipline on rate paid in addition to typical seasonal trends with municipal clients, but were up 4% year-over-year as a result of our ongoing focus on deepening client relationships.","Noninterest income increased 17% year-over-year, driven by investment banking which benefited from favorable market conditions, continued increases in the average fee per transaction and higher revenue across our entire spectrum of clients, the latter two of which reflect our increasing strategic relevance and differentiated value proposition for clients.","Pillar & Cohen also provided roughly $20 million of incremental fee income year-over-year. While we are only a few months into the acquisition, we are highly encouraged by the early synergies that we are realizing by having the permanent financing capabilities that the Pillar & Cohen business provides for our CRE clients.","Noninterest expense was up 10% year-over-year driven by incremental expenses from the Pillar & Cohen business in addition to increased investments in technology. Net income was up $29 million sequentially and a $109 million year-over-year, as a result of higher revenue, improved profitability and lower credit costs given the resolution of certain energy credits and overall asset quality strength.","In conclusion, while market conditions can drive quarterly variability, our wholesale segment continues to set new records. Clear evidence that our differentiated business model of delivering full capabilities to mid corporate and middle market clients is enabling us to deepen client relationships, consistently grow market share and enhance the earnings profile of the company.","With that, I'll turn it over back to Bill for some concluding remarks.","Bill Rogers","Thanks Aleem. So to conclude I'm going to point you to Slide 14, which highlights how this quarter's performance aligns with our overall investment thesis. So, first, the investments we have made in improving the diversity of our revenue mix was a key contributor to SunTrust delivering 10% year-over-year growth and earnings per share despite the 40% decline in mortgage-related revenue. At a high level much of our investment strategy has been the focus on growing and supporting our key areas of differentiation which has proven to be highly effective the more specifically.","Within CIB we have been particularly focused on investing in our M&A and equity platforms to allow us to increasingly become the strategic advisor of choice. M&A has delivered nearly as much revenue in the first six months of this year as they did in all of 2016. Further, our equity related businesses are continuing to gain relevance in market share with our corporate and institutional clients.","Within commercial banking and the broader wholesale platform we have invested heavily in developing our industry and corporate finance expertise such that we can deliver increasingly sophisticated solutions to all our clients. This quarter commercial banking produced record capital markets related income. And finally, the investments we made at LightStream, credit card and other consumer lending initiatives are providing top notch experiences for our clients in addition to consistent and profitable growth.","Each of these are significant accomplishments and the product of our proven execution, our consistent strategy and a high caliber of talent. In addition, we continue to make meaningful investments in technology to modernize our infrastructure and deliver differentiated experiences which embody our purpose, meet evolving client needs and position us for growth.","In the second quarter specifically we began on-boarding clients to SunView, our new online Treasury Manager Platform which provides an enhanced client experience. Improving our Treasury & Payment platforms is an integral part of our ability to fulfill our purpose and provide clients with capabilities outside of just rate paid. Additionally, we continue to test and pilot Robotic Process Automation in certain parts of the company where we expanded our class capabilities. Each of these investments will improve the client experience, help us to become more efficient and increase our flexibility and speed the market.","Second, we further improved the overall return and efficiency profile of the company. Our balance sheet optimization efforts combined with the improved rate environment drove 15 basis points year-over-year expansion in net interest margin. These efforts in conjunction with our progress and efficiency improvements in asset quality and higher capital returns led to a solid 12.5% return on tangible common equity in the second quarter.","While we made significant improvements we have accomplishments more to come. Going forward we will continue to build from this position of strength, maintaining a high focus on reducing cost that are not productive so we can invest further in talent and technology that provides for superior client experience.","Lastly, the strength of our capital position combined with our strong underwriting discipline enabled us to again grow capital returns in the CCAR cycles a significant achievement for the company, but more importantly, a significant value driver for our owners. Each owner not only gains incremental ownership of the company as a result of our 38% increase in share repurchases, but also benefits from a 54% increase in cash dividends.","Owners and perspective investors of SunTrust now benefit from an attractive dividend yield combined with our franchise and strong growth opportunities, given the investments we have made in key businesses, our attractive footprint and focus on making further improvements in returns and efficiency across the organization.","So, before we conclude, I would like to highlight Momentum onUp, which many of you likely read or heard about this quarter via CNBC, NPR, or The New York Times. Momentum onUp is the industry leading workplace financial wellness program we initially developed for our own teammates. Our own results were so compelling we decided to run this as a not for profit program in order to help our corporate and commercial clients to equip their employees with the tools they need for financial success.","The program provides a simple term key set up of tools and resources to help employees begin, sustain and track their progress towards financial concepts. Since the soft launch earlier this year we've had over 30 companies participate in the program. This is a significant way in which SunTrust is propelling Americans towards financial competence as a key manifestation of our purpose.","Overall, we have got great momentum going into the second half of the year and beyond and my optimism remains high making me incredibly proud to be a teammate, a client and an owner of SunTrust.","So with that, Ankur let me turn it back over to you.","Ankur Vyas","Okay, thanks Bill. Julia, we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. As we do that, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourselves to one primary question and one follow-up, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor. Please go ahead.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Bill Rogers","Hi Matt.","Aleem Gillani","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","If you look over the last few quarters, your NIMs consistently coming better than, I think you've expected and I think many of us have expected, obviously some of that is the deposit rate is being less and from the next thing that you have done, but can you just help frame, may be what\u2019s coming better than you've thought, maybe just those things and then kind of going forward were are some of the puts and takes where maybe you could come in better than the [indiscernible] that you talked about for 3Q?","Aleem Gillani","Okay, well overall you're right. NIM has come in better than we had initially thought going into each of those quarters and you\u2019re also right on the principle reason it's coming better. The deposit betas have remained remarkably low. And along with that I think we've generally benefited a little bit quarter-to-quarter in terms of premium am perhaps coming in a little bit lower than expected.","But as I think about the third quarter going from here, what we're thinking is NIM is generally sort of with a range of zero to two basis points better than we ended the second quarter. What might make it better than that? All the premium am comes in a little bit better than we think, were including some effect of premium am in that number. If deposit betas come in a little bit better we think perhaps, but I think overall included in our guidance 0 to 2 we're including some effect of deposit betas creeping up and I think they are starting to creep up as we had expected you know some time ago, there's a little bit of that starting to show up.","We've got day count in Q3, just the effective day count hurts us by a basis point. We're probably going to see a little bit of higher premium am in Q3 relative to Q2. I think that will hurt us by a basis point. So we're building all of that in Matt into that 0 to 2. If those things come in better that will help. And I think the other thing that could come in better and help is this real a long effort we've had on portfolio mix. Now we've been working hard in terms of our strategy, in terms of growing the right businesses, in terms of remixing the portfolio. And if we get more success in that than we expect and we've got good momentum then that change in deposit mix might help more than what we have in our guidance today, but what's in our guidance is what I expect.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just on the follow up what is the sensitivity to say a 25 or 50 basis point move in the long end, if you can help frame that?","Aleem Gillani","We're sort of roughly balanced between the short and the long ends. We don't have, we're not overweighed right now in one end to the other and so if we get some steepening of the curve that will certainly help. But that's also a longer effect, if the curve steepens up in a quarter or two that will help on loan production in that quarter or two. It will also help in terms of reinvestment of our securities book in that quarter or two and just to give you some sizing, our securities book pays up we get cash flow out of that book about a billion dollars a quarter. So, that's what we're reinvesting every quarter and if we do get some steepening that will help with that reinvestment, but as you can tell, on a $26 billion securities book, a $140 billion loan book, regular quarterly production and regular quarterly investment, it will take some time for steepening to start to show up in NIM.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next we have a question coming from the line of Ken Usdin. Please go ahead.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning guys.","Bill Rogers","Hi Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey I just wanted to ask a little bit on the fee side of the business, some ones you pointed out were quite good and you mentioned some of the puts and takes on the service charges stuff. I was just wondering if you can just give us some thoughts on mortgage and then also the new business and the CRE business given the newness of it and the variability of it, I guess what do you expect to see out of growth of those and also I just wanted to ask you further on the investment banking pipeline? Thanks.","Bill Rogers","Okay, Ken. On the mortgage side, I think we're sort of, now into what I'd call a regular pattern. First quarter will be slower, second, third quarter will be better and fourth quarter will be slower. I mean we\u2019re sort of end of that seasonal pattern and I think this year, would reflect that, although second half of the year probably won't look a whole lot different than the first half of the year sort of cutting those seasonal things in half.","As it relates to the real estate side, as it relates to the fee part of that, I mean a lot of it weighted towards the back end, you see things like Pillar, we see now it is a little more weighted towards the backend. You've seen tradition things like SunTrust Community Capital for us is a little more weighted to the backend and that seems like that would sort of be what we're looking at based upon pipelines and business activity today. And then on the investment banking side, we\u2019ve got a great first half of the year. I think we will have another good half of the year. I think the full year will be better than last year. I think we will continue that 10 years of growth in that business. So on those fronts, I feel second to feel really good.","Ken Usdin","Very good. And if I could just follow up on another new business, so can you just give us an update on LightStream, it looks like the yields might have been down a little bit, can you just talk about growth potential and competition just in that part of the business? Thanks guys.","Bill Rogers","Yes, year-over-year production in LightStream is up substantially. The yield was sort of very, a little bit of seasonality because there's a big home component into that, but does have a little bit of seasonal component into it in terms of the yield.","Yes it\u2019s very competitive, but it's been competitive. So there's some new entrants into the market, but the market had a pretty broad base of competitors before. I really like our positioning, so the fact that we've got LightStream that sort of has its independent part, but it also has departments tied in really tightly to the SunTrust franchise, so we're able to sort of push in a lot of different levers as it relates to growth of LightStream.","So we can\u2019t grow at 50% year-over-year forever. But we're pleased with the growth, we're pleased with the fact that it's accretive to everything we're doing from a return perspective and so we feel really good about our investors there.","Aleem Gillani","And in general with a portfolio that is yielding 5.5% we\u2019re very pleased with the overall results from that portfolio, so a couple basis points here and there don't really matter in that context.","Ken Usdin","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John McDonald. Please go ahead.","John McDonald","Hi good morning guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about loan growth, just a little bit of that core underlying trends you saw this quarter, where are you seeing opportunities, any areas where you might be a little more cautious on growing the loan book due to competitive conditions or are there other factors?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I mean, I think the loan growth story has got a lot of components to it and you know as we've talked about before, I mean we don't really sort of manage the loan growth, but we really look at the components that drive loan growth. We look at production, we look at pipelines, we look at paydowns and we look at utilization. And if we look at production it's up sequentially. I mean quarter-to-quarter it's up and it's sort of at 10 quarter kind of average, but paydowns were up a lot this year, this quarter excuse me, paydowns were up this quarter actually fairly substantially and up over the 10 quarter average.","Now the good news and there is a little diversion, the good news on the paydown side is we're seeing the benefit of that in the capital market side, I mean I think those have a high correlations. So when we see a beta we're getting the benefit of it in terms of refinance. Pipelines are good. They are a little bit down from sort of pre-election, but I think that's not uncommon, but June was good and most of the categories and utilization was a little bit down year-over-year a lot of that was energy related.","So I think the core part, if you break it down in terms of the wholesale CIB was down a bit, but commercial was strong. If you go into the consumer side and you look at the residential part of consumer that was sort of down, but if you look at the other components of consumer 14% year-over-year growth, so it\u2019s got a lot of different, different moving parts to it.","There are ways to think that we\u2019re cautious about. I would say you see some of that probably in the CIB side and less of about credit and more about return. As we see some things rolling off, we're very focused on the return profile. As you know, we\u2019ve had a lot of discipline around that, so if we've been in a cycle and we've been unable to achieve the kind of return, we're totally willing to move on and move to another opportunity where we think we can benefit more substantially.","CRE production and this is probably a little bit lower, there are things that we're more cautious about and we'll be more be more careful about, but having said that, structures that we have on our books we feel really good about and even the production structures seem to be holding up from a credit profile standpoint.","John McDonald","Okay.","Bill Rogers","So we will make sure that is several of your questions. If you sort of net it all out, it\u2019s going to grind upwards and I think the mix as we've talked about earlier is going to help NII sort of disproportionately.","John McDonald","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks Bill.","Operator","Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Gerard Cassidy. Please go ahead.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning Bill, good morning Aleem.","Aleem Gillani","Good morning, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","I wanted to follow up your comments on capital return and CCAR. Obviously you guys had a nice increase this year as you pointed out Aleem about 41% increase, but I noticed that your CET-1 ratio even in severely adverse case is still over 7%.","So can you talk to us about the target that you can see your CET-1 ratio and maybe how long it takes to get there? And then separately, you mentioned that you\u2019re amongst one of the lowest on the loan losses in the CCAR, but I noticed that the other losses for you guys was $1.1 billion. When I compare that to the regional banks, nobody is close to that. The highest is P&C at 0.3, so can you give us some color on that and what that might do to impact your targets going forward?","Aleem Gillani","Oh, I congratulate you on your detailed review of the FRB documents Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","It\u2019s a side of my life Aleem.","Aleem Gillani","All right. Let me take those in reverse order if that\u2019s okay.","Gerard Cassidy","Sure.","Aleem Gillani","So [indiscernible] difference, yes when you take a look at that, that is actually the result Gerard of a very conservative interpretation that we took of an FRB guideline around loans that we had in our pipeline for sale to Fannie and Freddie. Since the result, since one of the fact was released, we've had a conversation with the FRB and we've agreed to change our interpretation of that guidance.","And as the result of changing our interpretation the effect is that $1.1 billion going forward you probably see a number that will look more like $0.1 billion and that billion dollar benefit will show up in our overall CCAR loss rates. That's worth about 40 basis points. The capacity is in a severely adverse scenario, it\u2019s actually about 40 basis points higher than was reported and that will benefit us and our ability to repatriate going forward.","That I think leads into your first question which is sort of how do we think about capital ratios and what kind of capacity do we have overall. So we have as you said overall loan loss rates that are very low. We consistently or the FRB consistently models loan loss rates for SunTrust that are right around 4.5%. And that is not only at the low end of our peers, but it's also very consistently low there. So we have the lowest volatility against our peers and I think that says a lot about the diversity and quality of our loan book.","So if capital is there to support risk and if risk at SunTrust is noticeably lower than it appears, I think that the capital ratio what SunTrust requires is also lower than you would see against peers. Therefore I think that that gives us capacity to return more capital over time. You know we've been on this path of returning more capital over the last several years.","This year, I think we took a big step forward. I think we've right-sized our dividend now at around sort of 40% or so in terms of the payout ratio and I think over time, we're going to be able to grow the dividend perhaps a little bit, but also return more capital via buyback and get our ratio down from the current 9.5% rate to something under 9%. And further I would say I think we're going to be targeting to try and do that within the next couple of years or so, think about the next two CCAR cycles and we\u2019re going to take a good swing at this. That was a long answer, did I get to your question?","Gerard Cassidy","Yes you did very detailed. Thank you. Just as a quick follow up, would you consider resubmitting to adjust this $1.1 billion issue this year to maybe even ask for more capital return or is this going to be more 2018 submission issue?","Aleem Gillani","Gerard, you recall how many pages there are in a capital submission?","Gerard Cassidy","Quite a number.","Aleem Gillani","I think we will look at this as an opportunity for us in the next couple of years. And we submitted a capital plan that we thought was in the best interests of our owners this year, that plan was not objected to. So, we're not actually needing to change it and I think we'll be able to take another swing at this next year and I hope our owners are happy with what we can do for them.","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think that\u2019s the - wouldn't have changed this year\u2019s submission, but it just creates more capacity for the future.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez. Please go ahead sir.","Saul Martinez","Hi good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess if we can elaborate, if you can elaborate a little bit more on your comments on deposit betas moving up and just generally if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of deposit pricing in competition are seen clients ask for higher rates? And I guess that the rest of the question really is, you know do you see, how do you gauge the risk of sort of a non-linear type of step up in terms of, in terms of deposit pricing in rates, especially as we move further along in the rate cycle?","Aleem Gillani","Thank you for the question Saul. Actually we don't think of that as a high risk item. There is a lot of factors that go into a client's view of the value proposition they get from us and I guess generally from their bank. Certainly rate paid deposit rate paid is one of those, but the value proposition is so much more than rate paid right. It includes all the other services they get from banks and in our case it includes their capacity for example to transact with us via mobile, via tablet, via online to ATM, the advice that they get from our teammates and given the high liquidity that exists throughout the industry.","I think if you look at what is it, 6,000 odd banks in the industry we've got a overall loan to deposit ratio that's something like 80% are under 80%, that's a substantial amount of liquidity. So, we think that the risk of a step up in deposit rates is driven very much by competitive factors and there is just given the amount of liquidity that's available, given the amount, given the value proposition that clients get from us, we don't see that as a substantial risk.","Having said all that, to be clear deposit betas are creeping up and that is completely as expected. We've been saying for two or three years now that as rates start to climb we'll see deposit betas start low and move up over time and little by little that's happening. If you look at the deposit beta for SunTrust, total deposit beta for us in Q2 is on the order of 12%. And Q3 is probably in the range of 5% to 10% above that. So little by little they are, they are going to be moving up.","Bill Rogers","I would just add on your question on the competitive side. I mean it's a competitive market obviously and we're in a really high growth great market, so there are some cases uniquely competitive, but on the deposit side with occasional sort of, one bank here and one bank there, I think we've seen some consistency in the deposit pricing side. And then as Aleem noted, I mean we've been making lots of investments to go to create stickier deposits. I mean we've got really high adoption rate of our mobile technologies. Our deposit customers are 45% are sort of mobile users. So we've spent a lot of time and energy to put lot of barriers to the deposit beta script [ph] as we move forward.","Saul Martinez","That's helpful. If I could ask a follow up question, I guess a broader question on capital strategy in M&A, you obviously will talked about your excess capital position and the good results in the CCAR cycle, but how are you thinking about Bill, any incremental thoughts on your own strategy. You\u2019ve obviously focused on bolt-on types of acquisitions, and that's e-generation capability, but any incremental thoughts there in terms of willingness to look at depository institutions for example as part of that strategy?","Aleem Gillani","Yes, I mean I think the strategy stays the same. I mean the bolt-on part as you mentioned is a key part of what we do and some of those are deposit generators. I mean Pillar for example is a deposit business as well. So there were incremental things that, that came along with that. I think as you spend for two deposits are generated out of different channels. So we\u2019re going to be careful about thinking traditionally about how you find deposits and what channels you find them from. So I don't - I think you are going to see us in the small and midsized bank acquisition mode. I mean we've been pretty clear about that. We don't think that\u2019s accretive to a lot of things, not the least of which is our overall strategy. And I just don\u2019t think that changes from the perspective of rising rates and the challenge with deposit betas.","Saul Martinez","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just to tag on on that, do you think, I mean obviously it may not be part of your strategy, but do you think as we do move further along the rate cycle and deposit betas move up that, that it does trigger some consolidation especially amongst deposit hungry banks or smaller banks who may be closer to100% loan to deposit ratio might be a little bit more strange, just how do you think about that in terms of just the M&A landscape more broadly?","Bill Rogers","Yes, it's hard to speak for the others, but I think it's one variable, but efficiency and investment in technology and acquisition of talent and there are a lot of other variables that go into that, does that may be take on slightly higher weighting yes, but I don't think it becomes the dominant weighting.","Saul Martinez","Yes, thanks.","Bill Rogers","And Saul as I've said a couple of minutes ago, you know we've got 6,000 banks across the country, there's going to be some consolidation.","Saul Martinez","That makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot guys.","Bill Rogers","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you and next we'll go to the line of Stephen Scouten. Your line is open.","Stephen Scouten","Hey good morning guys. You mentioned you guys have more capacity for strategic investments moving forward, can you note if there's anything of particular focus for you guys, any fee line item that you want to expand or move into or any kind of targeted investment strategy that you might have moving forward?","Bill Rogers","Yes, I think a lot of businesses that we're in and the investments that we've made, I mean so those would be consistent. So for some sort of a framework we're not familiar with thinking we have a hole in our strategy of a place to invest, so a lot of things that we can do or to put more fuel on fires that we\u2019ve already started.","So, you see that's clearly on the consumer side where the LightStream and the things that we're doing there on that comes in marketing and advertising and things that we can do to continue to grow that, building infrastructure within our own system. Clearly on the SunTrust Robinson Humphrey side, I mean we've been investing for 10 years and I don't see that slowing or changing. I mean we're going to continue to invest and we add talent and our capacity is sort of where we see it and where the opportunities exist within our platform.","PWM is probably the place we've been investing in private wealth management a little bit more in the last year and I can see that where we're probably tilting a little bit more. Acquisition of talent, technology, capacity and we've been successful in on boarding teams and we've been successful in adding clients, so we've got a little momentum in that category. And then really technology that supports all of that, so technology on the call it the offensive side, from a client perspective and you see that in SunView and you see that and then see and know how we do a lot of originations, mortgage digitization, all those type of things.","And then maybe what I might call more defensive or efficiency in terms of robotics and cloud infrastructure, data likes and those type of things. So, I think it's not, we wake up and we say that we're going to go, move right, where we're going to left. Now we're going to continue to invest in the things that we're are investing in and disproportionally a little bit on the couple things that I mentioned.","Stephen Scouten","Okay, that's really helpful and one of your peers yesterday kind of mentioned an attitude of may be being able to run their bank more in their own view as opposed to in a regulators view. Would you guys comment if you share any of those sort of views that there are any tangible signs of a lighter touch from regulators and you guys might be able to run your bank maybe in some instances with more common sense and less of a just managing to do a certain test or metric?","Bill Rogers","I think our numbers great and we\u2019ve been running our bank pretty well in an existing environment. And we live in a highly regulated business and we're creating the capacity and capabilities to do that well. I think we see lots of things on the horizon that could be potentials in terms of utilizing our capital better and utilizing our liquidity better and those type of things and I think those have opened might be sort of a bigger impact on what we can do as a company.","Stephen Scouten","Okay, that's really helpful Bill, thank you guys so much.","Bill Rogers","Sure.","Operator","Thank you.","Ankur Vyas","And Julia, this will be the final question.","Operator","Thank you, we have a question coming from the line of Marty Mosby. Please go ahead.","Marty Mosby","Thanks, I appreciate you taking the questions.","Bill Rogers","Hi Marty.","Marty Mosby","Good morning. As good as this quarter was on the front of net interest income, efficiencies and credit which are the three dynamics you can really see as catalysts. There were some things that I think are still there or pockets that can still improve upon what we had in this quarter, one is that you started to build provisions so some of the net charge-offs and how low it got, you actually built provision which offset some of that benefit which is positive as you start to move through and continue to grow the consumer side.","The other thing is mortgage banking. It seems like there were some hedge ineffectiveness and servicing and just the gain on sales were lower. So just wanted you to comment a little bit about what you could see with mortgage banking and it seems like there is a little bit of a positive that you could get back if some of those unfavorable things went away.","Aleem Gillani","Thank you, Marty. I think we might have to send you a consultancy. So when it comes to mortgage I'd say actually it wasn\u2019t as much in the context of hedging effectiveness as it is in greater decay and so if you think about a mortgage asset that is MSR asset that is worth 60% more today than it was worth two years ago, every dollar of paydown from a client takes 60% more of that asset value out. So think about it in those terms rather than in terms of hedging effectiveness in terms of rate changes. So let\u2019s say that\u2019s what it was on the mortgage servicing side.","On the overall credit and asset quality side, look you're right. Asset quality today is particularly strong. It certainly is beating our expectations and we've just improved our guidance from 30% to 40% to 25% to 35% as a result. But we don't expect this to last over a cycle and we don't expect that net charge-offs are going to stay at 20 basis points forever. If you think about the components of that within CRE, net charge-offs today are basically zero and C&I overall net charge-offs are 10 basis points against the norm of something will be closer to 50.","And auto book, charges are very low that will probably normalize some and we've been working hard to remix our portfolio and add more consumer credit into our portfolio and that's helping on the loan yield side. But as those portfolios sees them, they'll probably see us modest increase in net charge-offs there.","So, I think about the allowance overall, I think we're in the right place now and over time we probably should see some normalization of charge-offs and therefore slightly higher provisions over time.","Bill Rogers ","That\u2019s why I think the provision bill was going ahead of some of those trends which is nice. The other thing Aleem that I wanted to talk about was the swap and when we run those down a couple years ago we took a lot of \u2013 took a lot of pressure from that. That though was designed to help you in this particular quarter as you finally saw short term interest rates going higher. So when you mentioned that you do have duration, what I wanted to make sure we kind of put our finger on was that your net interest margin improvement, one is better than what many in the market expected because of your actions earlier on which is making you more asset sensitive which is short term rates go up, you\u2019re benefiting from. It also gives you the trigger to extend duration whenever the longer end goes back up and that your loan mix is actually generating margin expansion as well. So there's a lot more going on here that could generate not just what we saw this quarter but actually benefits down the road as well.","Aleem Gillani","You are 100% right. We designed our swap portfolio to have a limited duration and as that portfolio rolls off a little bit quarter-by-quarter, every quarter the duration of that portfolio comes in a little bit. And you\u2019re completely right Marty, as that happens we\u2019re naturally if we do nothing we\u2019re naturally just going to become more asset sensitive over time. That is the way we design the balance sheet specifically and I think you\u2019re right that is going to help us as I look out over the next 24 to 36 months.","Bill Rogers","And it creates more flexibility.","Aleem Gillani","Yes and we\u2019ve got good capacity to invest where we want to, if we get a good steepening here, we\u2019re well positioned for that.","Marty Mosby","Thanks for answering my questions.","Bill Rogers","Thanks Marty and thanks everyone. This concludes our call. Thank you for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact the investor relations department.","Operator","Thank you. You may now disconnect."]}}
