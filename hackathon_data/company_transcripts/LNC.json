At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later, we will announce the opportunity for questions and instructions will be given at that time.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Vince. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's second quarter earnings call. Before I begin, we have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources, are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the Cautionary Statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our Reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to the most comparable GAAP measures. So presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As we anticipated, second quarter earnings showed a nice recovery following disappointing first quarter results, as operating earnings per share increased 25% sequentially. Compared to the prior year, earnings per share increased 7% as our diversified mix of businesses and sources of earnings coupled with capital management actions continue to support solid EPS growth.","We covered much of our strategy at the June Investor Day, and I would just like to highlight a few points. First, despite persistently low interest rates, we continue to grow EPS and book value per share, as we said we would. Randy will comment on income statement and balance sheet impacts from low rates in his remarks. I would just note that we are raising prices on certain products as we proactively respond to lower interest rates, consistent with prior years, and we see expense management as a key lever to sustain our targeted EPS growth. Importantly, we have a strong track record of controlling expenses and proved that once again this quarter.","Next, we have a keen focus on allocating capital towards growth opportunities at attractive returns. That said, where external events are affecting sales levels or returns, we are okay with using the capital intended to support sales growth to buy back our undervalued shares. Lincoln's leading distribution organizations combined with our manufacturing capabilities continue to differentiate us from peers. We are driving sales growth right now in our individual Life Insurance and Group Protection businesses, while innovative product solutions across our Annuity and RPS businesses will help sales growth. I'll expand on these in a minute.","Finally, as we have demonstrated for years, we have a quality balance sheet and generate a significant amount of free cash flow. This has allowed us to actively deploy capital to shareholders and it continued in the second quarter as we repurchased $275 million of stock.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 3% decrease in average account values resulted in annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, the recent recovery in equity markets led to earnings growth of 8% sequentially and positions us well for subsequent periods. Total annuity sales were $2 billion and net outflows $452 million.","As you have heard from us as well as other asset management companies, market volatility continues to dampen consumer demand for equity-sensitive products. VA sales are certainly in that camp, though I would note, our sales were largely unchanged compared to the first quarter. While sales are lower than we would like, we are still selling volumes that support our distribution value proposition and are not willing to take aggressive near-term actions to stimulate sales. In the interim, we are comfortable reallocating that capital to share buybacks.","We are bringing to market several unique product solutions early next year which capitalize on the growth trends and passive investments and fee-based compensation. These products will meaningfully enhance the value proposition and choice for guaranteed lifetime income, which is an essential solution for retirement savers.","Our Annuity business remains a high-quality source of earnings and we have produced a long track record of success that is different from others. As we have said, this success is because we started the business the right way and have maintained our consistent and disciplined product pricing, end-to-end risk management and industry-leading distribution. We hope you walked away with those take-aways at our Investor Day, as I continue to believe this business is under-appreciated.","Turning to Life Insurance, we generated strong earnings growth versus the prior year. In terms of sales, total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were 164 million, a 6% increase from the prior-year quarter. Two-thirds of our sales came from products without long-term guarantees and our sales are well diversified, with all products representing between 10% and 30% of total life insurance sales. Executive benefits sales, which can be lumpy, contributed 9 million to total life sales this quarter, while the prior year benefited from one large case.","As you know, we have done across-the-board product repricing for the past several years to reflect lower interest rates. As a result, many of our products are meeting targeted returns, even with today's lower interest rates and flatter forward curve. Where we are not achieving acceptable returns, we will reprice. Bottom line, we are committed to maintaining our risk management and product pricing discipline to get appropriate returns on capital. When combined with actions focused on in-force block profitability, we continue to be optimistic about our ability to grow our Life Insurance business.","Turning to Group Protection, we are well on our way to restoring the profitability and long-term growth potential of our Group business. Our non-medical loss ratio continues to improve as we benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to claims management functions. Sales momentum continues, as sales increased 15%. This marks another quarter of sales growth as the market disruption from our aggressive renewal repricing strategy has clearly subsided. In addition, as our renewal price increases moderate, we are beginning to see improvement in our renewal persistency. We expect premiums to stabilize in the back half of the year, and premium growth to reemerge in 2017.","I'm pleased to see the encouraging signs of growth while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline. We have the right strategy, people and processes in place and we are executing extremely well. As we have noted recently, top-line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. I am confident this will be achieved, providing a nice tailwind to earnings and further diversifying Lincoln's sources of earnings mix.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with both the prior year and the prior quarter and in line with expectations. Second quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were down 11% from a year ago, driven by a decline in mid-large market first year sales due to the timing of implementations. We have a strong pipeline and already committed new business scheduled for the second half of the year. This growth can be directly attributed to our focused strategy and investments in our digital and mobile customer experience, which is resonating in the marketplace.","In the small market, first-year sales were up 24% year-over-year, a result of distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity. Looking ahead, we expect this momentum to continue, aided by the recent launch of our enhanced small-market Director product. Recurring deposits were also up 3% year-over-year, evidence that our high-touch model continues to differentiate us and drive higher contributions and participation rates. Our overall sales momentum leads us to remain confident that 2016's net flows will exceed 2015 levels.","Shifting to investment results. Disciplined ALM and risk management continue to drive our investment strategy. We put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down 20 basis points from the first quarter. The decrease in new money rates was primarily due to a drop in Treasury rates as we invested at 205 basis points over the average ten-year treasury, consistent with recent periods.","The decline in interest rates also increased our net unrealized gain to 8.4 billion pre-tax, up from 5.5 billion in the first quarter. It is also worth noting that our energy portfolio, which has been an area of investor focus this year, swung to a net unrealized gain in the second quarter with values increasing by $600 million from the first quarter. Downgrades have also slowed and, as a result, our below investment-grade exposure decreased to 5.5%, a 10 basis point improvement from the first quarter.","Lastly, the annualized return on our alternative investments was nearly 6% in the second quarter, a significant improvement from the first quarter, however, still below our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the sequential improvement. We expect further earnings growth over time as we achieve our targeted return, modestly increase our exposure to alternatives and shift the mix towards private equity.","Turning to distribution which, as many of you recognize, truly differentiates Lincoln. Our wholesale, retail and worksite distribution organizations have been instrumental in driving our strategies and delivering on our consistent market presence. The strength and stability of over 90,000 active producers creates opportunities and enables our ability to target the faster-growing segments.","During the quarter, we saw strong producer growth across a number of our products, including MoneyGuard, fixed annuity, term, and RPS. And more advisors are selling multiple products, underscoring the power of our distribution franchise in combination with a diverse product portfolio. We are executing on our diversification strategy. At an enterprise level, no one product accounted for more than 14% of sales during the quarter and non-long term guarantee sales were 73% of our total sales, up from 69% a year ago. As manufacturing and distribution collaborate on existing new product innovations, I am confident that Lincoln will continue to differentiate itself in the marketplace.","On to DOL. There's not much new to discuss since our Investment Day, but it is important to reemphasize that our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the BIC to serve retirement savers and offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is leading to greater interest in our fee-based annuity product offering by distribution partners and advisors. At Lincoln, we continue to take a leadership role in working with the DOL and our distribution partners to be sure we are prepared for when the first part of the rule goes live in April 2017.","Lastly, as you recently saw, Mark Konen announced his decision to retire. I want to personally thank Mark for his partnership and leadership over the years and wish him the best in retirement. He has recruited a very strong management team, and by having Mark stay on board through the end of February 2017, I am confident there will be a smooth transition.","So in closing, I'm pleased that our earnings returned to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, let me reiterate that I remain confident in our ability to generate top and bottom-line growth and actively deploy capital.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of 373 million, or $1.56 per share for the second quarter, a 7% increase from the prior year. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our first quarter results, including accelerated amortization of DAC and group, adverse mortality in individual life and weak fee-based earnings, returned to expected levels. It is also worth noting that while alternative investment income improved significantly from the first quarter, returns were still below our expected results by roughly 7 million, or $0.03 per share, with 5 million of the shortfall hitting the life business. As an offset, expenses were favorable by a similar amount in the quarter, primarily in other operations.","Now, shifting to key performance metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $54.67, as we continue to consistently compound book value in the high-single digit range. Operating ROE remains strong at 11.7%, unchanged from the prior year. Expense discipline, beyond some of the favorability I noted upfront, resulted in our expense ratio declining by 50 basis points. This reflects our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower revenue growth. We expect expenses to continue to be a good story.","Net flows contributed $0.5 billion to account values, and with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the third quarter with a modest tailwind. Finally, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enabled us to repurchase 275 million of stock this quarter, retiring 2.6% of our shares outstanding, the most since the fourth quarter of 2011. Net income results for the quarter included 47 million of realized losses related to investments, while our variable annuity hedge program was effective with minimal breakage in what was a volatile quarter for the capital markets.","Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the current interest rate environment. The punchline is that we remain well positioned, even as rates and the forward curve have moved lower. Let's start by talking about the statutory balance sheet because that is what comes up most with investors. Recall at our June Investor Day we noted we had sufficiency in our overall cash flow testing, including stressing the 10-year treasury down to 50 basis points forever.","The one area we pointed to where there could be some temporary reserve strengthening is around certain secondary guarantee universal life subtests. For instance, if the ten-year treasury stayed at 1%, that could require up to $350 million, or 20 percentage points of RBC, a very manageable impact when you think about Lincoln having $8.7 billion of statutory capital and an RBC ratio of 500% at the end of the second quarter.","Now thinking about the other two areas that low rates impact life insurers, that being new business and spread compression, first on the impact on new business returns. Most of our products continue to achieve our targeted returns. But as Dennis noted, we will make changes where necessary to achieve acceptable returns.","Next on spread compression, which has been with us for a while now. We showed at Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assumed new money rates stayed at first quarter levels of 4%. We estimated this would depress EPS growth by 2% to 3%, versus 4% to 5% in prior years, but still enable us to achieve our targeted EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our June Investor Day, we estimate that we are likely to be at or slightly above the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but expect that other levers, such as capital and expense management, can offset this impact. So bottom line, low rates are manageable and we are hopeful that our peers begin to provide comparable disclosures so you all can better compare companies, as we believe views on Lincoln are misaligned.","Now turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reporting earnings for the quarter were $235 million compared to $255 million in the prior-year quarter. Lower fee income from a 3% decline in average account values is the primary driver of the year-over-year decline. Operating revenues declined 1% from the second quarter of 2015. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled nearly $0.5 billion, however, this organic growth was more than offset by negative market performance.","Return metrics continue to be strong, as ROE came in at 21%, consistent with our long-term average, while return on assets decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year, but did increase 3 basis points from the first quarter, stands at 77 basis points. Finally, as I noted up front, our variable annuity hedge program was effective in an extremely volatile quarter, particularly at the end of June, which further demonstrates the high quality of our Annuity business.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, up $1 million from the prior-year quarter. Second quarter revenue was flat year-over-year, as was average account balances and return on assets. Net flows were modestly positive in the quarter, nonetheless, our growth outlook remains positive for the second half of the year, which positions us well to increase account values.","Spreads excluding variable investment income compressed 9 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, near the low end of our expectation. While retirement earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates, continued growth in net flows positions us well for long-term earnings growth.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $120 million increased 14% from last year, as mortality returns to normal levels following elevated severity in the prior-year quarter. As I noted up front, alternative investment income was $5 million below our expected results for the Life business.","A full recovery in alternative income would have put our Life earnings right in line with the $125 million quarterly run rate I mentioned on last quarter's conference call. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 5 basis points versus the prior year, at the low end of our expectation.","Quickly on Life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 3%, with total in-force face amount up 4%, consistent with recent performance in our mid-single digit organic growth expectations. So second quarter results saw mortality recover from the prior year and typical first quarter seasonality. While earnings are facing some spread compression, drivers continue to support long-term earnings growth.","Group Protection earnings of 15 million were below the 19 million reported in the prior-year quarter, but well above the 5 million reported in the first quarter, as DAC amortization returned to more normal levels, as expected. The decline in earnings versus the prior year is due to lower premiums and investment income.","Loss ratios continue to benefit from our pricing and claims management actions. Our non-medical loss ratio improved to 72.5% this quarter from 73.6% in prior-year quarter. The year-over-year improvement was driven by favorable loss ratios in all product lines: life, disability and dental.","Non-medical earned premiums declined by 11% year-over-year. Lower renewal persistency in sales owing to our repricing initiatives have clearly provided a headwind to growth. However, as Dennis mentioned, we expect premium growth to reemerge next year, given positive leading indicators. Notably, sales increased 15% in the second quarter, marking our second straight quarter of sales growth, while renewal persistency increased to 76%, a nearly 20-percentage point improvement from the first quarter. As a result, we are confident top-line growth will provide the next lever for margin improvement.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to allocate a significant amount of capital to shareholders. This quarter we repurchased $275 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and shares trading well below book value. We expect to remain active allocators of capital.","As I briefly noted up front, statutory surplus stands at 8.7 billion and our RBC at ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%, both very strong numbers and up from the first quarter, due to the reinsurance transaction we executed in April. Holding company cash ended the quarter above our target of $500 million.","So to conclude, we saw our earnings power recover to more normal levels following depressed first quarter results, which lead to 7% EPS growth compared to the prior year. Lower for longer interest rates are manageable, even as the spot rate and the forward curve have moved lower. We are effectively managing G&A in a period of slower revenue growth to drive margin improvement and we remain disciplined yet opportunistic around share buybacks. And given our balance sheet strength, we expect to remain very active.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We now have approximately 30 minutes for Q&A. As a reminder, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, then re-queue for additional questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Vince to start Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS. Your line is open.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Dennis, I wanted to start with the VA new business. Obviously, flat quarter to quarter, even with the market recovery. I guess my question is, do we need to see some real significant product innovation there in terms of guarantees perhaps being a little bit more generous in order to get a rebound in sales here?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Suneet, as I said, we attribute the decline in VA sales to the volatility in equity markets. You see the same type of decline in sales volume for mutual funds. And so there's this outside volatility that is affecting our sales levels.","The response to that that I also mentioned in my remarks is that we do want to create some innovative products, not products that necessarily have richer benefits. I think the whole industry would be reluctant to do that right now because low interest rates really limit your flexibility on that. But we see real growth opportunities in expanding our products that are sold with fees. We see real opportunities \u2013 that's a consumer and an advisor preference.","We also see opportunities to improve our offerings of passive investment options. We also see the opportunity to use digitization in making the sales process more easy and intuitive, products simpler. And so those are the kind of actions that we're taking and we think that they will have a significant impact on sales as we get into 2017. Trying to do all of that stuff takes time. And as we get into 2017, we think we'll have an impact through those actions.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just similar question on the Life Insurance side. Are you already starting to reprice the business, given the decline in the rates, or is that something you are considering at this point, but you haven't actually started the process?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Suneet, we've been changing pricing on products in reaction to declining interest rates for years now. I'm not quite sure what the product launch is time-wise, but I can promise you that if something is not achieving its return, it's being repriced as we speak and will be launched when we can get the repricing done and get it up on our systems.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open, sir.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on the RBC ratio. You've been hovering generally in the high 490%s, up to 500% after the reinsurance transaction. I was just hoping to get some perspective on where you would like to run that going forward and if you have the ability to bring it down a little bit to take advantage of buyback opportunities.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Ryan, we've been running, as you noted, in the high 400%s for some time now, four or five years. And I think traveling in and around that area is an area we're very comfortable with. As I've noted a number of times, our expectation is as you move forward and we distribute capital that that RBC ratio would trend down over time, ultimately maybe declining to that 450% range or so. But it's something I think that is best if it happens over time.","How that relates to, I think, ultimately where your question is going is what do we think about share buybacks. I'd make this comment or this note. I think about share buybacks, I think it's best to start from the beginning. And what have we said all along here is that we would expect on an annual basis to distribute 50% to 55% of our operating earnings back to shareholders. That translates, if you do the math and you back out the fact that our dividends run about $250 million a year, to roughly 125 million to 150 million a quarter.","In addition, as we've talked about, sales have come down a little bit and that gives us a little bit of flexibility to boost that number up. And then we can use the strength in our balance sheet to go even a little above that. You saw that this quarter with 275 million for the quarter. And I would expect that we'd continue to take that same sort of view as we look forward.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then the follow-up, I guess this is more of a philosophical question. But have you contemplated having a higher mix of dividends versus buybacks in your capital deployment as a way to differentiate yourself and demonstrate the stability in your capital position that you've been highlighting?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, Ryan, I think when you look at what we've done over the last five years, we've increased our dividend dramatically. This year we're running at $0.25 a quarter, or $1 for the year. And that's up substantially and I think that demonstrates the fact that we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to generate annual cash flows. I don't think anybody out there can put forth a record of generating capital and distributing that capital like we have over the last five to six years.","So we've done just what you would suggest. We've increased our dividend significantly, reflective of our confidence. I would expect, obviously it's a decision of the board, but that we would continue to increase that dividend. But the reality is right now, Ryan, that we believe that allocating capital to share buybacks is a very good use of capital. We believe it's a high-return opportunity and we will likely continue to do that.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Randy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Randy Binner of FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, I'll try this one with Randy. I think you mentioned in your comments that you felt that peer disclosure was not comparable to Lincoln. So in light of some trading effect on your stock I think today from a large life insurer taking a charge, I'd be interested if you'd feel comfortable expanding on that and helping us understand a little bit better how your disclosure might be more useful or different than peers.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Randy, thanks for the question. Part of this, you have to give as speculation. But if you asked me what do I think the number one overhang on our stock is today, it is low interest rates and investors' perception of how low interest rates impact Lincoln, primarily around the balance sheet. And that's why we have focused so intently on trying to get the message out to investors how exactly we are impacted by low interest rates on our balance sheet. I reiterated it in my discussion today and we had a very fulsome discussion at our most recent Investor Day about the impacts. I think there's a perception among investors that the impacts are larger than we've shown and so we continue to try to get that message out there.","I think that message would be enhanced if other companies were to have similar disclosures so that there was a more fulsome understanding among investors across the industry. I think any time you're out there doing something on your own, some investors will have a tough time moving that way or agreeing with just one company's view of the world. So I think it's always helpful if you can have more companies and that's why I say that. I think you will continue to see that as interest rates stay low for a longer period of time. I think you'll continue to see companies expand the disclosures around this area and I think it'll be beneficial.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would add to that that along with line of business earning, we happen to think it's very important from an investor perspective to see the source of earnings, capital market-driven earnings, interest rate-driven earnings, mortality and morbidity earnings. But that's a different view and I think an important view from an investor's standpoint to understand the prospects of the company.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And I guess just to summarize where you're standing, because we'll have an actuarial review in the third quarter, is that while some lines may be more interest rate-exposed, you've pivoted away from the most exposed products. And if you look at the impact over the total base of your statutory reserves, you feel that you're going to have more than adequate buffer across the board and that's the nature of the actuarial review that you'll do in the third quarter.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we noted at Investor Day, our buffer as defined by reserve adequacy and cash flow testing has increased from $8 billion to $11 billion over the last three years. And we expect it to continue to increase, providing additional cushion. So we are very confident in our cash flow testing results. We've talked about the subtests and the potential impact and our ability to manage that in the context of the strength of our balance sheet. So, yes, we remain very confident in the cash flow testing process and the significant strength of our balance sheet.","The results around cash flow testing and these other areas I think ultimately, Randy, are very company-specific. And the reality is the products we sell yield this result. We have some products in there that are impacted by low interest rates, there's no doubt. Secondary guarantee UL, being the biggest example, but that is manageable in the context of a company with the diversified business mix that we have.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Kovac of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions regarding the upcoming assumption reviews in the third quarter. Is there anything that Lincoln is conducting in terms of either new systems or deep dives or changes in terms of what you're looking at for utilization, whether it's your own information versus industry data that we should be thinking about as we head into the back half of the year?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mike, it sounds like your question is focused in on annuities, but I'll just give you some broad thoughts on the upcoming assumption review. And let me preface this by saying I'm not going to front-run the process. There are lots of people at Lincoln working very hard on this process as we speak.","I think the results that come out of an unlocking are, once again, same thing I said for the last question. But they're very company-specific. I think the primary drivers of the results that come out of these unlocking processes, there are a number of them, but if you had to ask me to pick a couple, I would say this. It has to do with the riskiness of the optionality of the products you have on your balance sheet and it has to do with the point at which you start from an assumption standpoint.","When you look at Lincoln, so let's talk about the facts now. When you look at Lincoln over the last decade, but I'll focus on the last four years because that's when we've made a number of assumption changes. And now I'm focusing in on the Annuity side. What you see is a very solid result.","In fact, if you look at unlocking over the last four years in the Annuity business, the net unlocking impact has been a positive, a number in excess of $100 million. It had a low one year of negative $7 million and another year of $60 million. Very consistent results. And then if you look inside of that result, you would see there are a number of large assumption changes. We changed lapses significantly, we changed utilization significantly. But each and every year, there's been a consistent result. No big negatives along the way.","That has to do, once again, I think with the fact that our products are designed very well and the people who design these products were very thoughtful when they were putting together the assumptions they were going to use inside those products. They were not right on every assumption, but in the totality of assumption setting, they did a great job. And you see that in the results. So that's how we've done. That's just the reality of the facts.","Now let's look forward. I believe it was Will had a good piece of his presentation where he focused on if you look at the key assumptions in the Annuity business again and you look at what we would expect if you had to take rather dramatic changes in those assumptions, what would the impact be. Let's take lapse rates. We have a very low lapse rate embedded in our models, 3.8%. Look, if we had to cut that number in half, the impact that we showed was $50 million. Once again, very small. The reality is I think we have an expectation of 3.8% in our model, right now experience has been running at 3.4%. So right in line with where we are.","The other big assumption, utilization. If we needed to change our model to 100% effective utilization, complete and total effective utilization, that would be $160 million. Once again, a relatively small number. Utilization, by the way, has been running spot on with what's in our model. And the third item is mortality. If mortality was to improve significantly, 20% I think is the number that we showed that would have a net impact of $90 million. Morality in and of itself is running right in line with our expectations. So we've had great results in the Annuity business. We don't have any expectation of big negatives going forward based on where we are today. That's the Annuity story. I don't think the story would be any different if you went across our other businesses.","For instance in the Life business. If you look at the unlocking results over the past four years, six years, ten years, what you're going to see is a pattern of consistency. The Life business over the last four years, I'll use that same period again, I think the sum total of the results has been about a negative $100 million. And that was all last year when we unlocked, when we lowered our long-term J-curve assumption.","So, Mike, I think we've had a great history of results. We fully expect to have good results going forward. I go into any unlocking process assuming that we're in a good place because that's been our history. But we'll see. Once again, there are lots of people doing lots of work out there. But I have no reason to have any bad expectation coming into any of this regardless of what other companies may be experiencing because it is very fact-specific to each and every company.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks. That's helpful. Helpful answer. In terms of one other item that I heard mentioned by Dennis in the opening remarks, expense management obviously a key lever and a strong track record for Lincoln on that. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper into that. Is there anything specifically new that you're looking at from the expense side from here on out, given changes in maybe either sales or the outlook for the macro?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start with our overarching expense management tactic or starting point. And that is we're very disciplined during the budgeting process that our expense growth in a budget is 1% to 2% less than that year's revenue growth. And some of that reduction can come from volume, but sometimes it has to come from core operating expenses. So we start off by saying you can't have a budget that doesn't show an improvement in your expense ratio. That's an important ongoing management discipline.","Now in addition to that, we are looking very hard at digital strategies to further drive down our core expenses. We're on the front end of that. I think there is meaningful opportunity with process improvement and digitization. And, again, we're on the front end of this and it will take time to size and execute.","We're also looking at partnerships where others can do things more economically than we can. I think there's opportunity there as well. What I've been saying internally, if you sort of look at two big issues, one is that the foreign digital companies are setting the standard for the relationship between companies and consumers' expectations about ease of doing business. We weren't born digital, but we're taking very decisive steps to improve our customer experience. Along with that will come expense saving.","The second big issue, as we all know and we've been spending time on it this morning, is that low interest rates hurt margins. And so you are compelled to have a very aggressive reaction to that and find ways to overcome it. So looking at expenses again, start with our core strength of expenses aren't going to grow at a faster rate than revenues, and then we're looking at additional things, digitization, partners who can do it less expensively and those things to achieve earnings per share growth. Pretty excited about it actually.","Mike Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Looking at Group Protection, I hear Dennis and Randy's remarks talk about the improvement in margin will hinge on the premium growth or getting new sales of new business. But looking at your sales growth and also some of the market commentary related to pricing being a little bit more aggressive right now, can you talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace and how your current pricing of the new business relative to your assumptions?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me first respond to the competition in the marketplace. We don't see any significant change in that. I know other companies may have referred to some increased competition. But in the markets that we serve, we are not seeing a significant difference in competitiveness from the first quarter or actually from last year.","And, remember, most of our sales are in the 1,000-employee and below category and also 30% to 40%, I forget the number, are in the employee voluntary space. So I start with the premise from what we can see there's not been a significant change in the competitive or pricing in the marketplace. It could be different for other companies that have different segments than we do.","Randy, do you want to take the second half of that question?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Humphrey, reiterate the second half outside of competition, just in genera are you talking about premium growth?","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yes.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, Humphrey, when you look at where we are today, sales growth for the last two quarters, persistency \u2013 and this is really I think the key element \u2013 returning to more normal levels. If you remember in the first quarter we had persistency of 57%. It's tough to grow premiums if your persistency is only 57%. You can do the math.","This quarter we saw significant recovery to 76%. I think that's reflective of the fact that the significant pricing actions that the group team has taken over the last few years have \u2013 we're a little removed from them, we're out of the significant price increases and you're starting to see that in broker behavior. So persistency up significantly. And we'd expect it to continue to trend up from where we are today.","So when you factor in sales starting to grow again, persistency getting back to normal levels, the math just works where the premium level we experienced this quarter should be right around the trough. And then you level out for a little bit. And then as you move into 2017, we'd expect that you'd start to see premiums grow little bit. Ultimately, we'd like to get premium growth back to that mid-single digit area.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color. And then shifting gears to Retirement Plan Services. I think in Dennis' remarks, talked about expecting the pipeline in the second half to be strong and then expecting full-year net flows to be exceeding 2015 level. But I was just wondering can you maybe give a little bit more color in terms of what you're specifically seeing in the pipeline and in terms of opportunities out there?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that we don't typically get into pipeline numbers. The bottom line is that with the pipeline and with already committed sales, we expect to see positive flows in the second half and full year 2016 going above the net flows that we saw in 2015.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Randy, my one question relates to the mechanics, the operation of this subtest. And I'm interested in this issue because, of course, it goes to the question that all investors have, which is whether these low rates are an income statement issue or in fact a balance sheet issue.","And my question regarding this subtest is this. If the subtest essentially requires you to move capital within the Life Insurance company, but doesn't require you to increase capital in the Life Insurance company \u2013 and maybe my problem is that I don't fully understand or have an accurate understanding of how the subtest works, but if it is simply an intra-Life Insurance company capital allocation issue, why should it really matter to people looking at your financials?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, I think as with any potential allocation of capital, it has to do with the potential size of that allocation and your capacity to deal with that particular item. As I mentioned, for us, in the case of these subtests, you're talking about $350 million with the ten-year treasury at 1%. That compares to a balance sheet that has a total capacity of 8.7 billion of capital, 500% RBC ratio.","Now, if the potential size of that impact was much bigger and the amount of capacity on your balance sheet to manage that impact was smaller, then you would have to think about where is that capital going to come from to maintain all of the other things I want to do with the company, the ratings, et cetera. So it's about the size of the potential impact compared to your capacity to manage that impact.","What I have said, I have given you the potential size of the impacts and I've stated that our balance sheet is very strong and we feel very comfortable saying that we have the capacity to manage those potential impacts of those subtests. Specifically, what are these subtests? They have the generic names, 8C and 8D. They are tests of particular books of business.","For us, the one subtest that becomes the item that generates the potential reserves is 8D. 8D is a test where the earned rate that you use as part of the calculation is defined. It is defined by an index, an index that is established between July 1 and June 30 of the year preceding the end of the calendar year. So for the end of 2016, the rate has already been defined. It was finalized on June 30. Very confident and comfortable that that index level, we are fine in 2016.","As you move into 2017, you're in the middle of setting that, or you just started setting that index right now. On July 1, you'd be using that index. You'll develop the average index rate over the following 12 months, and that's the rate that we'll use at the end of 2017. So that's mechanically how these things are calculated.","I've given you the potential size of the impacts, very comfortable saying we can manage them. But I can't tell you what those facts are for some other company. I don't know what their potential impacts are and I can't speak to their capacity to manage those impacts. But for Lincoln, that is how it works and that is the story.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Eric, I heard a different question. You can have the kind of redundancy in our reserves in total that Randy mentioned. This is a separate test that even though you have a big cushion, in total this is a separate test that you'd have to meet anyway. If that's helpful.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's a helpful clarification and it definitely complements Randy's response. So thank you, Dennis. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marvin Schwartz of Neuberger Berman. Your line is open.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Holdings LLC","Gentlemen, I congratulate you not only on an excellent quarter, but on an excellent call. Okay. I can't tell you how impressed I am with all of the things that you are doing to intelligently and conservatively manage and grow your earnings.","The question is, on the share buyback program that you have, I appreciate that in the second quarter, you bought back more stock from any single quarter than for many years going back to 2011. What I would suggest you consider, and you've never done this before, is doing an accelerated share repurchase program where you call your investment banker, whoever it is that's representing you on the buyback, and you have idea in your mind how much stock you might like to buy back for the third quarter. Do it right up front while the stock is at this price and get it done really fast and then you have options if you want to go back in addition to that with a continuation of your daily program. But in my opinion, buying back the stock on an accelerated basis makes a lot of sense. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Marvin, I appreciate the input. We have actually used ASRs in the past. Most recently we used one a couple quarters for about half of that quarter's buy back. So it's something we definitely have used in the past and will definitely think about moving forward, but appreciate the comments.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Marvin, I really appreciate the predicate to the question. Thank you for those compliments.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman Holdings LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude Q&A for today.

Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Christie. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's second quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends in market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.","These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including adjusted income from operations and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures. I would note, we have also included a slide presentation for today's call, which is included on our website.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone.","Second quarter results were very solid, as all four businesses delivered revenue growth and double-digit increases in earnings. Adjusted operating earnings per share were up 9%, which is strong given variable investment income was below our average run rate in the quarter, while the prior-year quarter was above. But normalizing for this variability, adjusted earnings per share was up 19%. Other key shareholder metrics were also positive with book value per share up 8% and return on equity, excluding AOCI, over 13%.","This morning, we're going to handle our prepared remarks a little differently. I'm going to focus my comments on the status of several important strategic initiatives, as well as address some topics that are creating a bit of noise in the marketplace. There are a few accompanying slides posted on our website that cover most of these issues. Randy will then speak to second quarter results in greater detail.","Let me begin by describing our actions to restore annuity sales and return to positive net flows. We continue to make significant progress, as total annuity sales accelerated in the second quarter, up 50% over the prior-year quarter to $3 billion, and net outflows improved by nearly $0.5 billion sequentially to $126 million. This growth was driven by management actions and improvement in industry trends. In addition to stronger sales, VA new business returns also increased. The overall annuity portfolio generated a ROE of 22% in the quarter.","As I noted, broader industry fundamentals continued to improve. LIMRA has forecast an increase in annuity sales of 5% to 10% this year and currently anticipates further growth for the industry in 2019. This forecast is up from its prior outlook, citing benefits of higher interest rates and improved regulatory conditions, and marks the first time LIMRA is expecting growth since 2014.","It is also worth highlighting that this quarter we helped launch the Alliance for Lifetime Income, which brings together 24 financial services companies and leading retirement advocates. All the members are making a significant financial investment to support a national education and advertising campaign on retirement income planning and how annuities can fit into consumers' financial plans.","With investable assets expected to more than double to $91 trillion by 2030, there's a significant long-term growth opportunity for annuities and the industry, combined with the Alliance, can help advisors and consumers understand the unrivaled benefits of protected lifetime income.","Now, turning to management actions. Our strategy of expanding the product portfolio and distribution continues to show meaningful progress. This quarter, new products and expanded distribution drove 28% of annuity sales. Variable annuity sales increased 30% compared to the prior-year quarter. This quarter's sales strength was broad-based, with growth across all distribution channels and both qualified and non-qualified markets.","Our guaranteed sales increased 49% and represented half of total annuity sales. VAs with risk-managed funds remain the largest contributor to annuity sales, while newer products which provide more investment flexibility and payout options are enabling us to reach more customers and advisors and, at the same time, diversify our sales mix.","Late in the second quarter, we launched an indexed variable annuity, Lincoln Level Advantage, which is a new product category for Lincoln and a fast-growing segment of the annuity marketplace. We are encouraged by the product's early success and we'll be adding more distribution partners over the next year.","Fixed annuity sales more than doubled to almost $900 million, with half of the sales generated from new products and expanded distribution. We are now selling through more banks and broker dealers, and have also begun to partner with a few independent marketing organizations, which is a new annuity distribution channel for Lincoln. As you know, we are also leveraging reinsurance to enhance our competitive position.","Bottom line, we are clearly benefiting from an improved industry backdrop, our multi-channel distribution model, industry-leading shelf space, and a broader set of consumer solutions, which, when combined, gives me a lot of confidence in our ability to further increase sales and return to positive flows by the end of this year.","Turning to the Liberty acquisition and progress on integration. We intended Liberty to immediately increase our scale in the group benefits business, further broaden the customer base and distribution access, and expand our capabilities. These benefits were already evident during the second quarter. Our results were strong, with earnings of $45 million and a 5.3% after-tax margin. We experienced favorable risk results on both the Lincoln and Liberty blocks of business, and solid premium growth, driven by good sales and stable persistency.","We expect premiums in the third quarter to be approximately $1 billion, which factors in a full three months of Liberty contributions. This quarterly run rate is ahead of our initial expectations, as the level of rate increases and retention are better than we initially projected. As a result, we remain confident in our repricing program, which Liberty began last year.","Integration efforts are broad-based and include aligning organizational structures, maintaining and growing distribution relationships, and rationalizing various technology and claim systems. We continue to closely manage integration cost and narrow in on potential expense savings. While it is still too early to provide specific details, we see the potential for upside to our $100 million expense-save target.","From an enterprise perspective, the addition of Liberty Group business will get us to our target of approximately one-third of earnings coming from insurance risks. As you know, we have also been shifting more of our sales towards products without long-term guarantees. Over the last five years, 72% of new business was from products without long-term guarantees. These combined actions have tilted the risk profile of our business in a positive direction and is expected to reduce our beta over time.","It's important to note that while we are nearing our target business mix within our capital market-sensitive businesses, we also have some beneficial offsets that help to contribute a steady source of earnings and can support EPS growth. For instance, over the past five years, our EPS growth rate has benefited 2% from the net impact of capital markets, something we expect can continue over time. We believe this is helpful to recognize, knowing interest rate levels and equity market growth rates change over time.","To highlight these points, and as you can see on page 4 of the slide deck I referenced, last year 69% of our earnings came from the combination of fees on assets under management and investment spread. This is consistent with several years ago. However, the underlying mix has reversed. This mix shift has been driven by tailwinds from the equity bull market, combined with low interest rate headwinds. Notably, this combination has dampened earnings volatility and still produced a net earnings benefit of 2% within our total EPS growth rate of 12% over the past five years.","Now, as you can see on page 5, as we look out three years, we are less reliant on robust equity market growth to generate a similar earnings benefit from capital markets. This is driven by the fact that interest rates are higher, enabling spread compression to abate sooner than expected.","For example, if the 10-year treasury rate averages 3% over the next three years, we will add 1% to our consolidated earnings growth rate. This compares to the negative 3-percentage-point headwind to consolidated earnings growth over the last five years. Therefore, equity markets would only need to grow about 3% to give us the same earnings contribution from capital markets.","Bottom line, we like the diversification, interplay and consistent growth provided by our capital market sources of earnings, and are confident in our ability to regularly deliver on our targeted earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 10%.","Now, let me touch on our MoneyGuard product, which has been swept up into the broader discussions about traditional long-term care. The product is very different than traditional LTC, and it is important to understand our MoneyGuard product has capped benefits compared to unlimited lifetime benefits for many of the closed blocks of traditional LTC business. And the multi-benefit product design, including a death benefit, return of premium or limited long-term care benefits, creates a very different risk profile and can reduce policyholder behavior risk.","MoneyGuard was also priced in an environment when the errors of earlier LTC providers were obvious and industry experience was much more reliable, and our assumptions reflect this. For example, our lapse rate assumptions are below 1%. We do not assume morbidity improvement and we expect mortality to improve. Nevertheless, we stress the in-force business on these key factors, as it is clear there are no balance sheet issues even when you combine multiple scenarios.","Lastly, as we oftentimes do, we engaged a third-party, Milliman, a leading actuarial consulting firm in the LTC space to perform a general comparison of our key current pricing assumptions and product risk for Lincoln's MoneyGuard to those typical for traditional LTC products in the industry.","Milliman confirmed our MoneyGuard assumptions are generally in line with or more conservative than current rational pricing assumptions being used for traditional LTC products when considering differences in design, and that MoneyGuard is better equipped to handle adverse experience than traditional LTC products. So the key takeaway here is that MoneyGuard is not like the closed block LTC businesses that are giving some companies headaches.","Lastly, turning to the balance sheet. As we have demonstrated for years, the balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate a significant amount of cash flow, allowing for active capital management. As you know, we temporarily paused buybacks to help fund a portion of the Liberty acquisition. However, with confidence in the Liberty integration and the strength of our balance sheet, we resumed share repurchases during the second quarter. We expect the pace of buybacks to increase in subsequent quarters.","Our RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 460% and we now estimate the impact to year-end RBC from tax reform is approximately 40 percentage points, down from the prior guidance of 60 points. Changes to C1 factors remain very fluid and modifications won't be implemented until 2019 at the earliest. As a reminder, none of these outcomes are expected to affect our capital adequacy, and capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.","Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, with below investment-grade assets representing just 4.1% of our fixed income portfolio, the lowest percentage in over a decade. This improvement is the result of proactive de-risking and favorable ratings migration, which positions us well if the credit environment turns.","So, in closing, I am very pleased with the quarter and hope my broader comments give you more confidence in our strategic architecture and execution capabilities, growth potential in various capital market environments and balance sheet strength. I remain convinced our simple, clear, and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and consistent delivery of strong earnings results, as we saw again this quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported adjusted income from operations of $454 million or $2.02 per share for the second quarter, a 9% increase from the prior year. Underlying trends were strong as all four businesses combined operating revenue growth with good expense management to generate double-digit earnings growth in each business.","It is worth noting that variable investment income was $0.08 below long-term experience, with the vast majority related to lower returns on the alternatives investment portfolio. Returns this quarter were 5%, compared to 17% in the prior-year quarter. We do expect returns on alternatives to improve to our long-term experience of 10%.","Touching on performance of key financial metrics in the quarter. Positive consolidated net flows and equity market strength led to a 7% increase in average account values, and operating revenues increased 12%. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as the net G&A expense ratio improved 30 basis points. Adjusted operating return on equity came in at 13.1%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8%.","Finally, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be strong, which enabled us to resume buybacks this quarter following the close of the Liberty acquisition. Net income totaled $385 million in the quarter, impacted by $40 million of net losses in the VA hedge program, $35 million of acquisition and integration expenses, and a $9 million gain related to investments.","Now, I will turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $275 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 5% increase in average account values due to equity market strength over the past year more than offsetting negative net flows.","As Dennis noted, we continue to make significant progress on our goal of returning to positive flows. This quarter's net outflows totaled just $126 million. When annualized, this represents a nearly 200-basis-point improvement in the organic growth rate compared to full-year 2017. Total operating revenue increased 3%, while G&A expenses decreased 8%. Return metrics remained strong with ROA at 81 basis points and an ROE of 22%.","It is also worth highlighting that within the statistical supplement, we are now breaking out annuity earnings between variable and fixed annuities. While most of you are aware of the primary source of earnings for the annuity business is VA, we do make a significant amount of money from our fixed business.","This quarter, fixed annuity earnings were $50 million, consistent with recent quarters. So, another very good quarter from the annuity business, with the highlight being the significant increase in annuity sales and net flows, which positions us well for net flows to turn positive and earnings momentum to continue.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $43 million, compared to $37 million in the prior year. The earnings increase is attributable to the benefits of tax reform, growth in fee income, and expense management, partially offset by lower variable investment income.","Total deposits in the quarter of $2.2 billion were up 12% from a year ago, driven by double-digit growth in both first-year sales and recurring deposits. Net flows totaled $499 million and marked the 10th consecutive quarter of positive flows. Over the trailing 12 months, net flows have totaled $1.8 billion, which, when combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $69 billion, up 11%.","G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, decreased 5%, resulting in an approximate 150-basis-point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 4 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, but the ROA was 25 basis points. So, a strong result for the Retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets, and earnings.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of $150 million increased from $133 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily attributable to the benefits of tax reform and expense management, partially offset by lower variable investment income.","Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $162 million decreased 18%, as the prior-year quarter included accelerated MoneyGuard sales ahead of pricing adjustments. We expect sales momentum to increase in the second half of the year, as we have rolled out a number of new products in recent months.","Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter with average account balances up 6% and Life Insurance in-force up 4%. Revenues were up less than driver growth, driven by the weaker variable investment income I noted upfront. However, G&A expenses dropped 10%, which resulted in positive operating leverage. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 5 basis points year-over-year, while mortality experience was in line with expectations.","So, a solid quarter for the Life business. With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single-digit range, we are well-positioned for near- and a long-term earnings growth in the Life business.","Group Protection reported $45 million in earnings compared to $35 million in the prior-year quarter, with the increase in earnings attributable to the acquisition of Liberty. My comments this morning will largely focus on reported results, though at times I will highlight specific metrics on the Lincoln block of business to better level-set results and enhance your analysis.","Sales in the quarter increased 7%, driven by growth in the Disability and Life product lines. Non-medical earned premiums were up 71% from the prior-year quarter as a result of both the acquisition and continued momentum in key premium drivers, namely sales and persistency. The non-medical loss ratio increased to 73%, which merely reflects the impact from the acquisition. Overall risk results remained favorable, with Lincoln's loss ratio of 66.6% largely unchanged from the prior-year quarter, and Liberty's loss ratio coming in a couple points ahead of expectations.","Bottom line, it was a very strong initial quarter for the newly-combined business. The after-tax margin of 5.3% is already within our 5% to 7% margin target and we are optimistic about our ability to exceed the targets highlighted when we announced the acquisition.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus stands at $9.1 billion and our RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 460%, consistent with the pro forma ratio highlighted when we announced the acquisition. Holding company cash came in above our $450 million target.","Our strong capital and liquidity positions, combined with predictable cash flows, enabled us to return to the buyback marketplace shortly after closing Liberty. During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock and expect to increase the pace of share repurchases in subsequent quarters at a level consistent with our free cash flow guidance.","So, wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. Adjusted operating EPS increased 9% from the prior-year quarter. High-quality results, as all four businesses delivered revenue and double-digit earnings growth, even with alternative investment income running well below last year.","Underwriting results in Group Protection and Life business were solid, while Annuity and RPS benefited from account value growth. Key shareholder metrics were strong as book value per share increased 8% and ROE exceeded 13%. Finally, we reinstated our buyback program and expect capital deployment to remain an important and consistent part of our story.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, and then re-queue if you have additional questions.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Christie to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Thank you. I was just hoping you could talk a bit more about where the Liberty acquisition is performing better than expected. And you mentioned potentially a greater opportunity for cost savings. So, if that plays out, would it mean that you need a less rate to kind of get the block to target margins or would you potentially get there more quickly than your initial guidance?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","We had a little hard time hearing that question, but if I can repeat it, I think you asked where is the Liberty acquisition performing better than expected? I didn't hear the end of that. But just to repeat what I said, let's first start with premium. The $1 billion premium expectation for the next quarter would be ahead of the amount that we had anticipated. And as I said, that's related to the fact that we're getting good pricing increases and that, on the Liberty block, the persistency remains where we expected it to be.","The other points are that we think the integration costs, we're managing those closely. But as we've dug deeper into the cost structure of both organizations, we think we can squeeze more out of integration cost savings and that would come across a wide variety of business areas.","So, to summarize, higher premium expectations because of repricing the program and persistency being better than we assumed and much more focused on upping our $100 million cost saving program. And I would say on that, when we convey $100 million cost saving programs in all the years that we've been doing acquisitions, generally expectation that we'll beat the numbers that we provided and have beat the numbers that we've provided over the years.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. That's helpful. And then, on the expense savings, I guess the question was just if you are able to achieve more, it would seem then you'd need less rate than you initially expected to kind of get the block to target margins. So you might be able to get there faster than the guidance of kind of two full rate cycles. Is that a fair assumption?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","As a general comment, yes.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And then just one follow-up on MoneyGuard, and I appreciate the additional disclosure there. You mentioned that adverse deviations and assumptions are an earnings risk, not a balance sheet issue. Can you just give us a sense of the impact on the IRR or profitability in a negative scenario?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","I think as we have talked about in the past, Erik, the impacts on returns in the MoneyGuard business is a very similar story to any potential sensitivities from changes and assumptions that we've demonstrated on the balance sheet today, and that they're much more muted. So, similar type of stresses typically have had about a 4% or so impact on returns in that line of business, much less than you would see in these older, traditional LTC books of business.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Got it. And that's off of a starting point of an IRR of close to 20%?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Right now, we're getting very strong returns on MoneyGuard business. Over time, we haven't always gotten very strong returns on the MoneyGuard business, but we've gotten good returns consistent with our 12% to 15% sort of range that we target for our businesses.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thank you very much.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk about where you're seeing new money rates at this point? And then, I guess, I just wanted to clarify, I think you said a 3% 10-year would lead to actually a 1% benefit to annual earnings growth. So, does that suggest that, I guess, around current levels your new money rates are exceeding portfolio yields now?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Let me answer specifically what we're getting on new money. In the first quarter, we got around 4.1% yield. And in the second quarter, we achieved a 4.3% yield. And this compares to our fixed income portfolio yield of 4.67% and 4.63%. So we'd have to see interest rates higher to meet the portfolio book yield.","What we're referring to is, as you blend in the new money yields and the existing money yields get repaid, it comes together and stops spread compression. So it's a combination of the existing portfolio running off with higher rates as well as new money with better rates.","But, in any event, the important point is that we saw 3% headwinds to our earnings over the last three years because of low interest rates. And looking forward, over the next three years, not a negative 3% but a positive 1% at the levels of interest rates that are in the market today, the 10-year roughly at 3%.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. That's helpful. And then, Randy, I know you won't want to front-run the review, but do you have any high-level thoughts on certain key indicators ahead of the actuarial assumption review in the third quarter?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, Ryan, I don't. It's a similar story to what I said last year. I can't front-run the process. We're only one month into the third quarter when we do our review. My expectations are sort of very high-level and it's really based upon what Lincoln's experience has been over the many, many years. And that's that there's been pluses and minuses that by and large have added up to a good result, a result that we've been very proud of and a result that's differentiated us from the industry. I have no doubt, as we come into the third quarter, that there will be pluses and minuses, but at this point, I have no idea what they'll add up to.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Just a follow-up, first, on Erik's question on the earnings impact from MoneyGuard on the benefits utilization of the LTC rider. Randy, if there's up say, worst-case scenario, 25% to 30% pressure on those margins, just remind us or can you give some indication of what proportion MoneyGuard would represent of the Individual Life block? So, how material that could be if it did trend in the wrong direction?","And then also can you comment on \u2013 I appreciate the sensitivity, but can you talk about what trends you're seeing now? Like, are you seeing modest adverse utilization, or just some perspective on that would be helpful too.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Sure. As to what MoneyGuard represents in the business, I think can't get anything more specific than, if you look at MoneyGuard, it's $10 billion in reserves, and if you look at the Life business in total, it's about $50 billion of reserves. So, MoneyGuard represents roughly 20% of the in-force business in the Life business. So, that would give you one dimension.","In terms of our current experience on assumptions, it's really very favorable. So, if we go over the different pieces, morbidity incidents has actually run better than our pricing expectation. So we currently run in the 90s, I believe, from an A-to-E on our morbidity experience. Mortality has run pretty much in line with our expectations and lapse rates also have been a very good story.","I would remind you on these items, particularly the lapse rate, we started out from the very beginning with a very low lapse rate assumption, and so there hasn't been a need to move that. We started out with a morbidity assumption that does not include morbidity improvement, as Dennis mentioned. That's been a very favorable story. And we started out with a mortality improvement that actually includes mortality improvement.","So, as oftentimes is the case with assumptions, it's about where you start. That's been a good story for Lincoln over the years, reference back to the annuity unlockings of the past. The final answer was predicated upon where we started, and I think it's the same result when you think about a product like MoneyGuard. The folks who have designed these products and priced these products over the years have done a very good job in thinking about the future.","Something we benefited from is the fact that MoneyGuard is a more recent product, and so we've been able to leverage all of that experience that's been built up over the last 20 to 30 years, and we're benefiting from that. We benefit from that in our results, and that's what you see in what we've discussed today and what we've put in that slide deck.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. So, bottom line on this is the utilization trends of your rider is not seeing any kind of read across similar trends that the primary LTC products are seeing, where obviously that's been developing negatively for several insurers. So you're actually seeing favorable development so far, anyway.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","100% correct, Tom.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And then just another topic. Are you able to quantify total hedging costs that are now flowing through your GAAP annuity earnings, whether that's basis points or dollars that we should be thinking about flowing through your GAAP operating earnings? Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Tom, I think I'll reference you to sort of our pre-tax earnings break-out, where we do break out a VA rider component. Now, I don't have that page in front of me, so I'm going to a little bit from memory. But my recollection is they make up roughly 5% of Lincoln's overall pre-tax earnings. Once again, I'm forgetting the exact number, but it's probably about somewhere between 5% and 10% of overall annuity earnings.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","So you're saying rider fees would be 5% to 10% of annuity earnings, or is that an approximation of just what hedge costs would be, 5% to 10% of total pre-tax annuity earnings?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","The difference \u2013 so remember how that we account for this. We have an expectation for what hedging costs will be over time, and we run that below the line. We then take the difference between the total fee we charge the consumer and that amount that we move below the line to cover the hedge program. And that's the amount that runs through operating income in the annuity business and, at the end of the day, through the total company. In total, that represents about 5%, 4.5% of our pre-tax income.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","For the whole company?",".","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","For the whole company. And, yeah, I'd estimate 5% to 10% of the annuity business in total.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I think the rider fees are on page 7, FYI. But I had a question on buybacks. You've mentioned a couple of times that you expect buybacks to accelerate in the second half. How should we think about what percent of your operating income you would deploy towards buybacks and dividends? I think you were doing roughly $200 million in buybacks before the Liberty deal. Should you get to a similar pace or how do we think about sort of deployable capital now that the deal is closed?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, Jimmy. I'd remind you that, with tax reform, we shifted the way we've been discussing this more to a dollar amount. And, as we've talked about in the past, I'd expect, on an annual basis, $850 million to $950 million of deployment.","Now, if you do the math, our current shareholder dividends are roughly $275 million a year or so. So, if you just back that off in the $850 million to $950 million, you'd end up with a range of $575 million to $675 million. So, a midpoint in there is roughly $150 million a quarter. So, that's sort of the math of what we tell you.","And I would remind you that that is exactly the same number we have been telling you for about the last four years. And then, when I'm answering these questions, I have always said and I will continue to say, we do everything we can to outperform and that's what we'll do again.","So we come into that back half of the year with that guidance, which implies a number of roughly $150 million and then we'll do everything we can to overachieve.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And that guidance, it takes into account any changes in (42:50) and\/or like the impact of tax reform on the RBC?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Takes in all of those impacts.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the annuity business, your sales were actually pretty strong. To what extent did the level advantage \u2013 the buffer annuity that you introduced in the quarter, to what extent did that contribute to your expectations for that product, given that a number of your competitors have actually shown pretty strong growth?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Jimmy, we just put that product into the market a couple of weeks ago, and we're getting excellent response. But in this quarter, because it came in late, you got to establish the relationships. It's only about $20 million, the total. But we expect this to be a big contributor for growth as we move forward.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow a little bit more back on Group Protection. So, clearly, the 5.3% this quarter was really good and I think you talked about the risk experientials a little favorable. But then you have premiums kind of coming into the third quarter should be another uplift along with potential cost savings.","So, in terms of thinking about the 5.3% this quarter, is that a reasonable starting point going forward as you talked about potentially exceeding your margin target?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, Humphrey, it's Randy. Thanks for the question. So I think we had a very good quarter in the Group business. If you go back to the initial guidance we gave back when we announced the acquisition, we had an expectation that in 2020 we would get to about a 5.5% margin. That's my recollection. So, with this quarter, we essentially got to what we thought in 2020. We had very good experience, as you mentioned, this quarter.","Will great experience continue? It's been with us for a while, probably linked to the strong economy. But it could bounce around. You're right, expense savings will continue to feather into the results. So we feel very good about both the quarter and, as Dennis said, our ability to outperform that 5.5% number we put out there for 2020.","And I won't speak to quarter-to-quarter because you can get volatility in this business. But, once again, we're very comfortable with our ability to outperform the original expectations we had for this business.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then, maybe just a question in terms of the pricing philosophy. So you've talked about repricing is probably better than your expectation, while persistency continues to be good for the block. And then, expenses, there could be some potential upside in terms of what you can achieve from a cost savings perspective.","So, in that case, like, would you like still target the same level of rate increase that you had in your plan? Or would you willing to give up some of the price increase, given the margin being subsidized by the better cost savings?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think we're going to try to maximize all of those things to get the best possible result for both our customers as well as our shareholders. And as you, Humphrey, can imagine, all of those things interplay with sales and persistency. So we're going to continue to use all the levers that we can to get the best results that we can.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. First question I had was just on cash flows and annuities, and I guess more specifically, variable annuities. And one of the things I've struggled with anyway has been sort of comparing your block relative to peers.","And so I was wondering if you could help me think about, if I separate the total asset requirement and sort of the assets back in the book, how much cash flow in a base case would you expect from the back book of variable annuities?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Alex, without getting specific, let's just talk about the facts. We have one of the highest returning annuity businesses in the industry, bar none. The earnings power of this business, remember, a return in this business well over 20% and it's been that way for a long time, translates directly over to expected cash flows out of the business, I would expect also.","So we capitalize our business very strongly. We've talked about that. We have a two-pronged approach, the greater of CET 98 and a minimum floor amount of capital. We have great product design and we have a great hedge program that's all led to this very strong return business, which translates into a business that spits off cash.","We don't get into talking about this business is that or that business is that. We roll it up. And we talked about $850 million to $950 million of deployable capital over time. It's been a very strong story for a number of years and I'd expect it to be a strong story going forward.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. And then, just on net flows and annuities, can you help me think about what you've been doing on sort of expanding the wholesaler network? How deep into the process are you? Like, how much of that work is sort of already reflected in the sales results from this quarter, as opposed to sort of maybe upside as you continue to roll it out?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. We've increased our annuity wholesaler head count by about 11% since 2017. So we're up in the neighborhood of 216. Still planning to add more. As I mentioned, we still can't say the name. We have a very large new distribution partner coming on in the third quarter. So we'll have to staff up for that, not just on the annuity business, but some of the other products as well.","So, staff overall, the client-facing head count at Lincoln is up 9% since the prior quarter, and this relates to adding shelf space and distribution partners and a little bit of specialty focus on some of the products.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. A couple of questions. I guess, first, maybe just to follow up on Tom Gallagher's question on the sensitivity analysis that you showed for MoneyGuard. I'm trying to get a sense of how extreme those scenarios are. They seem pretty extreme, but have there been ever time periods where you came even close to hitting those sort of sensitivities that you outlined in the slide deck?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","No. As I mentioned earlier, Jay \u2013 and thanks for the question, by the way. I would agree with you. Those are very extreme scenarios, speaks to what MoneyGuard is. It's a product with these benefits that offset each other. It's a product where the one thing we know when we price it is that we're going to pay a benefit. That's very important in driving the muted sensitivity of the reserves and also in driving favorable policyholder behavior.","But, no, we've never seen 0% lapse rates. I don't think we'll ever see 0% lapse rates. We have very low lapse rates, and we price for and assume that in our product. As I mentioned, morbidity is and always has run better than our expectations. And we've never seen mortality run 25% better than our assumptions.","So, could have said a short answer, but it's no.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you. The other question on annuity net flows, obviously you want to move that towards the positive territory relatively soon. What about specifically on the variable side? Could that be positive over the next couple years?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, we think so.","Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Just wanted to touch on the VII commentary. I think you had said alternative returns were about half of what you normally expect. So, anything unusual in terms of what drove the weakness this quarter? And then seems like you're still confident in the 10%. Is that something that we could see recover in the back half of 2018?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","The answer to your last question is our expectation is that we will achieve or better our expected return of 10% on this portfolio in the course of 2018. These are generally not investments that are correlated to equity markets completely at all, but there's some correlation to equity markets. So our expectation is that we'll get to, for the full year, our targeted returns. We've achieved better than that over the last couple of years.","We have some view into specific investments that could help us get there, but it's a number that moves around. But to answer your question and be clear, as we sit here today trying to anticipate what's going to happen over the course of the next six months from a macroeconomic perspective and a investment-by-investment perspective, we expect to get back to our targets, if not above.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, I guess on the MoneyGuard slide, in particular the Milliman study, I just note the commentary about your assumptions being more conservative than current rational pricing assumptions. As we think about those three key assumptions, morbidity, mortality and lapse rates, any color on where the industry is the least rational across those three?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","No, but we used rational to convey that we weren't just taking the average. So, as I discussed, the average, if you included morbidity improvements, would be higher, and we just don't have any morbidity improvements. And we saw today I guess or yesterday, that could be a significant hit if you had assumed that. So I would just say that, with the help of Milliman but based on our own confidence and the experience that we have, that we're equal to or better than rational assumptions in the marketplace.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just one last one for Randy. I think we had another Oliver Wyman update since we last spoke. Anything changed there in terms of how you're thinking about what VA capital and reserve requirements might look like?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, Suneet. We are very comfortable. We've been an active participant, working with Oliver Wyman, working with the regulators to get to a solution that improves the result for both regulators and the industry. I think we've done that in that we've ended up with an outcome that is closer to the economics of these products, and I think that's a very good thing for the long-term.","In terms of the bits and pieces of the final result, feel very good that I think there's a better alignment between the capital calculation and the reserve calculation, feel very good that the standard scenario has been made more of a remote event, feel very good that we've ended up with hedge accounting associated with the derivatives, especially the interest rate derivatives.","Are there some items in a perfect world that would be a little different? Yeah. I think some of the standard scenario assumptions are still a little conservative. I think there's some other conservatism in the result. But, in total, working with regulators, working with Oliver Wyman, who the regulators employed to do this work, we feel really good about where we ended up.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, Randy. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Nadel of UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks for sneaking me in before the top of the hour. Just a follow-up on Tom's question earlier, and I'm looking at page 7 of the supplement. Is it fair for us to think about it rather simplistically this way, Randy? If you are showing us a positive contribution to operating income from the VA riders, like you have each of at least in the last five quarters, and I think it's actually much longer than that, then the below-the-line cost of hedging is effectively 100% covered by the rider fee that's allocated below the line?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","So, John, let's talk about what we've experienced over the years. We have reported a operating return in the annuity business of 20% or a little above. Historically, below the line, we've had breakage that would take in between 1 and 2 points off of that, so 5% to 10% of the bottom-line result. So, that translates to roughly $15 million to $20 million or so of sort of expected breakage below the line. We price for that. It has to do with whether it's fund basis or some of the various items that you have in running the hedge program.","But that's sort of the expectation. That's what we've experienced pretty steadily over the years. Our result, whether you look at the operating result or whether you incorporate any breakage, has been very, very consistent over the years, running pretty Steady Eddie over the years. So, that's what I'd expect, John.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","It's been a great result and I have no doubt that it will stay great going forward.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","I just want to make sure that it's not just a matter of semantics, or terminology is probably the better word. Breakage is not necessarily, though, the same as the outright hedge costs, right?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","And the hedge cost is being funded by the rider fees.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Correct.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And so you've got a net flight, right, earnings contribution from rider fees and that's just the excess of the rider fees above the actual cost of hedging, correct?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes. We have rider fees...","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","...that come in above the cost of hedging.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. So, to the extent that your VA rider fees weren't sufficient to cover the cost of hedging, we would see that in a higher, if you will, below-the-line loss?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, let's go over the period of time. There will be moments of time when the daily cost of hedging or the weekly cost of hedging may exceed the amount we're charging, but...","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","...you know how we view this stuff. We view this stuff over a period of time. And if we see persistent or changes that we expect to persist in the future, then we go and we change the pricing of the product. Go back to pre-crisis, the cost of these benefits was 65 basis points, and the cost today is about twice that.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then lastly, real quick, fixed annuity sales were very strong this quarter, nearly $900 million. I'm assuming the vast majority of that, if not all of that, is indexed annuities.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Maybe you can, one, just confirm that. And then two is how much of that came through the Athene relationship? And does this represent just your proportional share of that or is it a gross amount?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","It's one-half.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And was it the predominant driver of that almost $900 million of sales?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","No. Our new products, the Athene was about 50% of our fixed annuity sales this quarter, 48%, in that area. A lot of the fixed annuity sales came through new bank relationships as well, and this new IMO relationship that we talked about.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marvin Schwartz of Neuberger Berman. Your line is open.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman BD LLC","I'm not sure if I'm making a statement or asking a question, but as a management team, you have all clearly done an absolutely first-rate job in overseeing the growth of the operations of the company, and you have done it in a quality way, and you have done it in a relatively risk reduction kind of manner.","Notwithstanding that, you do not get very much respect in the stock market. Even today, you came out with perfectly fine results, and your stock is under a lot of pressure. Now, I believe, and I don't think anyone would disagree with this, you're going to end up this year with a book value of about $68 a share, and that excludes AOCI. And a year from December, December 2019, that should grow to $75 or $76, and the following year it grows to $84 a share. And your stock is selling at about 7.0 times a consensus $9.20 per share estimate for next year and 6.4 times a consensus $10.20 per share for 2020.","In view of that, I really think it's time for you to have a serious (1:03:43) amongst your top-level management. And notwithstanding that you've had a certain share buyback pattern for the last four years, as you mentioned earlier, I think you should be buying back a substantially greater amount of stock than you're buying.","I think A.M. Best would not disagree with a step-up or meaningful increase in the amount of stock that you might like to buy back. I think that they would go along with it. I mean, obviously, if they didn't go along with it, you certainly wouldn't do it because you have to protect the credit ratings of the company at all costs. But I really think it's time for you to review the commitment that you have to share buyback, and I think that it should be dramatically improved.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Marvin, thanks for the comments. By the way, we agree with many of your assessments. It's one of the reasons we pushed to get back into the market after the close of Liberty. You saw that with $100 million of buyback this quarter. It's why we're committed to growing that number in the last half of the year.","As you mentioned, in the end, we are a rating-sensitive business. So we do have to take that into account, but I also agree that we have a strong balance sheet and we're going to do everything we can to buy back what we believe is an undervalued piece of stock.","Now, we have had a (1:05:28) over the years to investing in our equity. That's led to a reduction in our share count over the last six years of about 33%, about a third. We've done that at an average price of about $40. So it's been a great investment. We agree with you. We're going to continue to invest in our equity. And we hear you, Marvin. Thank you.","Marvin Charles Schwartz - Neuberger Berman BD LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our Q&A session for today. If we did not take your question, we will follow up with you later this afternoon. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni for any further remarks.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions].","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial\u2019s first quarter earnings call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Operating earnings per share once again increased over the prior year quarter, albeit slightly as operating earnings were down due to elevated mortality in Individual Life and poor Group Protection results. We acknowledged at the start to the year was lower than analyst projections, but we remain comfortable with our financial planning and business targets. Our confidence is grounded on several fronts.","First and foremost, our broad and deep distribution franchise consistently gives Lincoln a competitive advantage. This enables momentum and long-term revenue and earnings drivers to continue. We saw this in the first quarter with positive net flows in all of our businesses, sales that benefited from various product introductions and refinements, which resulted in good sales growth as the quarter progressed and has continued in April. Account value growth in every business with total balances up 6% to a record 222 billion.","Next, we have a rigorous approach to expense management. This quarter, we once again saw our expense ratio decrease from the prior year. Also, our balance sheet strength and capital generation enables us to complement organic earnings with capital management, further augmenting earnings per share growth.","All of this supports key shareholder metrics, several of which showed impressive growth this quarter including book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 9% from the prior year. The repurchase of 350 million of Lincoln shares, a post financial crisis high, and a 25% year-over-year increase in our common stock dividend.","While our ROE was negatively impacted by the earnings items I noted upfront, our ROE in a seasonally weak quarter and in the midst of a continued turnaround in Group Protection exceeded 11% which is consistent with returns generated by our peers during 2014. That being said, we clearly expect our ROEs to recover and remain above peers.","Let me now turn to our business lines, starting with annuities. Favorable equity markets and positive net flows led to a 7% increase in our average account balances and another solid earnings quarter. Our consistent market presence continues to produce quarterly sales in the $3 billion range and positive net flows. Variable annuity deposits of 2.7 billion decreased 8% from the first quarter of last year, but we are encouraged by the sales momentum we saw over the course of the first quarter.","To provide some context, average daily sales in March were up 15% compared to January and February and this trajectory has continued in April. As a result, we expect quarterly annuity sales to exceed 3 billion in the next quarter, which should also enhance net flows.","We remain focused on pushing the percentage of variable annuity sales from products without living benefits to 30%. This quarter, we reached 27%, up from 19% in the prior year period, making the seventh straight quarter of sequential increases. When factoring in the impact of sales on sales covered by our reinsurance treaty, non-guarantee products comprise 58% of total DA sales.","Our consistent market presence and proven track record of offering valuable customer solutions that also enable Lincoln to achieve good returns and managed risk still holds true today. In a DA marketplace that remains rational, we are confident we are positioned for growth.","Turning to Individual Life, total life insurance sales in the quarter were 153 million, a 6% increase from the prior year quarter. With one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry, we continue to deliver growth with a diversified mix of sales and by selling more products without long-term guarantees.","This quarter, no single product represented more than 29% of total production, down from 32% last year and 62% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees, up from 59% in the prior year quarter. Equally important, within each product we have different features and options that enable our distributors to expand consumer reach, but also give Lincoln another tactic to diversify risk. An example of this is our MoneyGuard product, where roughly half of our sales this quarter were flex pay and the other half single pay. This reduces interest rate sensitivity.","Focusing on individual life insurance, sales decreased 2% in the quarter, however, similar to my prior comments around variable annuity sales, we are encouraged by the sales momentum we saw in March and the carry through to April. Also of note, most products contributed to this momentum.","COLI and BOLI sales were 14 million in the quarter compared with just 3 million in the prior year quarter. Our outlook and appetite for COLI and BOLI has not changed, as we will remain opportunistic. Overall, sales here need to meet the same 12% to 15% return hurdle we target for our entire life portfolio.","Looking forward, while we did see a bump in mortality, which Randy will speak to later, we expect profitable sales growth in 2015 given the depth and breadth of our distribution relationships and product diversity combined with prudent underwriting.","Turning to Group Protection, Randy will touch on our operating earnings loss shortly. The lack of earnings improvement is disappointing, but does not change our expectations of approaching our target margins toward the end of 2016 to 2017 timeframe. We are beginning to see traction on the actions we have been implementing and are encouraged by the underlying pricing and claims management trends. We remain focused on taking pricing actions aimed at our employer-paid businesses and enhancing claims management to restore profitability.","First quarter sales of 56 million were down 13% from the same period last year. Our pricing actions continued to put downward pressure on new business opportunities, particularly in the 1,000 plus market, which historically has been a more competitive segment of the market. Looking forward, we see sales growth remaining pressured as we continue to push for rate increases.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were impacted by some spread compression though we are encouraged by underlying business drivers. Notably, we returned to positive net flows. Flows of $115 million improved significantly when measured against outflows in the fourth quarter and prior year quarter. Positive net flows in the first quarter is consistent with our year end outlook that called for positive net flows for the first half of 2015.","Our optimism and visibility now extends through the third quarter. A few pieces to this outlook. First, our pipeline is strong. This should benefit first year sales in the next couple of quarters. Also, our expectations around retention remain favorable. We attribute this to our constant traded effort on improving planned sponsor and participant experiences.","We remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business. Longer term, our core markets are poised to grow faster than the industry while continued expansion into segments like government and small markets bode well for Lincoln.","Turning to distribution, the depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continues to differentiate Lincoln. We currently have over 1,400 client facing professionals, up 4% versus the prior year. The number of producers selling Lincoln products is 63,000 strong and 26% of them are cross-selling, up from the prior year.","As we have discussed in the past, our large distribution force enables our mix shifts. For example, our focus on growing variable annuities without guarantees. We now have almost 13,000 producers selling BAs without guarantees, up 26% from a year ago. At Lincoln Financial Network, we had 163 experienced advisors choose to affiliate with Lincoln this quarter, which puts our advisor network at more than 8,300, including a 2% increase in registered reps.","Spending a minute on Investment Management, our new money purchases of $2.8 billion in the first quarter were invested at an average yield of 3.8%, which was down from the 4.3% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the drop in treasury rates, as well as an asset mix, which fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter.","We delivered a 186 basis point spread on new money over the average 10-year treasury, which is strong and consistent with our historical experience. Our yield enhancing debt program continues to add value to our core investment strategy and added 12 basis points to new money rates in the quarter.","Income from alternative investments was 8 million for the quarter, which was below the prior year\u2019s quarter as well as our historical average. This result was driven by headwinds from our energy exposure, which we believe has stabilized.","Before wrapping up, I want to briefly discuss the Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary standards proposal. As you have heard from other management teams, this is a voluminous and complex proposal and like most financial service companies, we are reviewing the proposal to understand all of its potential implications. As with all pertinent regulatory matters, there is a process and the details are very important. We will be very engaged, express our views, as well as collaborate with various industry trade groups.","In the end, there likely will be some change. We believe companies with scale, a broad set of product offerings and a strong and diverse distribution franchises with a proven ability to pivot in response to marketplace or regulatory changes will be best positioned to navigate changes. Clearly, we are confident on all these fronts and expect it to once again differentiate Lincoln.","In closing, I recognize the year started slower than many expected. However, I do not expect seasonal fluctuations in mortality to define our year. Our franchise remains a competitive advantage, while our sales and flows outlook are strong. Both will enable our long-term revenue and earnings momentum to continue.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of 352 million or $1.35 per share for the first quarter, up 1% from the prior year. Consistent with first quarter results the past few years [indiscernible] by 30 million compared to 18 million last year.","As you know, we do not normalize for mortality, as it will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we felt the deviation relative to our expectation was large enough that it should be mentioned.","Looking at key performance metrics, the top line continues to show healthy mid-single digit growth with operating revenue up 5% for the quarter, driven by another quarter of positive net flows and the benefit of favorable equity markets.","We remain focused on managing expenses, which again drove margin expansion as the 4% growth in G&A net of capitalized expenses trailed revenue growth. It is also worth noting the elevated expenses, which I attributed to seasonality in the fourth quarter, did normalize.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $49.70, an all-time high. As Dennis noted, operating return on equity came in at 11.2%, negatively impacted by the adverse mortality and poor results in Group Protection. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, which gives us significant financial flexibility.","Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by 28 million for variable annuity net derivative losses and 10 million of losses within our general account.","Now, I will turn to segment results and start with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were 239 million, an 11% increase over last year. Operating revenues increased 9% from the first quarter of 2014, as positive net flows continued and we benefited from further tailwinds in equity markets, which combined drove a 7% increase in average account values that reached 123 billion at the end of the quarter.","Return metrics, whether measured by ROA or ROE, remain strong. ROA increased three basis points versus the prior year and stands at 78 basis points while ROE came in at 25%, consistent with the fourth quarter. We continue to expect profitable growth in deposits and net flows, which will add to our record asset levels and drive further upside to annuities earnings.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of 35 million. First quarter revenue growth was up 1% year-over-year. Account values benefited from positive net flows in the first quarter along with favorable equity market performance. As a result, account values increased sequentially and ended the quarter at 55 billion, up 5% versus the prior year.","Normalized spreads compressed 13 basis points versus the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business. Our return on assets was 26 basis points for the first quarter, within the 25 to 30 basis point range we have discussed in the past.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of 111 million were down as a result of the fluctuations in mortality. 26 million of the quarter\u2019s adverse mortality hit the Life Insurance segment versus 18 million in the prior year quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our focus on retaining more mortality exposure combined with the business recaptured at year end should lead to some increase in quarterly volatility.","Looking at mortality experience in the current quarter, and understanding that we don\u2019t yet have complete information, we do believe the severe winter weather and flu season likely played a part in our experience, consistent with comments made from others in the industry. It is worth noting that we typically have seen seasonally high mortality in the first quarter only to see mortality improve over the course of the year.","To provide some context, Individual Life\u2019s first quarter earnings for the past couple of years have averaged 20% of full year earnings. So while Life\u2019s first quarter results were once again negatively impacted by elevated mortality, we expect that when viewed over more extended period of time, experience will be in line with our longer term expectations.","It is also worth mentioning that our outlook for the business we recaptured at year end has not changed. Notably, it will have a modest negative impact on Individual Life earnings and slightly increase our quarterly earnings volatility but be accretive to EPS given the benefit of incremental share buybacks.","Turning quickly to the life earnings drivers, average account values were up 5% with average in force base amount up 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spreads came in around 166 basis points, down 5 basis points from the prior year, once again in line with our expectations.","Group Protection fell short of expectations, as we reported a loss from operations of 6 million in the first quarter compared to a gain of 20 million in the prior year. The earnings do mask significant sequential improvement in key metrics. Our non-medical loss ratio improved from 81% in the fourth quarter of last year to 78% this quarter.","Importantly, our disability loss ratio declined nearly 10 percentage points to 80 [indiscernible] process and is evenly split between the decrease in claim incidents and higher recoveries with both improving by approximately 10%. These positive earnings drivers were offset by a few negative items, including accelerated amortization of DAC and a portion of the elevated mortality I noted upfront.","In terms of the accelerated amortization of DAC, this was primarily due to our extensive re-pricing of policy renewals. This reduced earnings by approximately 10 million when compared to the fourth quarter. With the first quarter our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.","Looking forward, although we expect amortization to be up versus prior year quarters, we do not anticipate the 10 million I noted for this quarter to recur in subsequent periods of 2015. Bottom line, we do expect earnings to improve but continue to caution that the improvement will not be linear.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Given our strong year-end capital position and the benefit from the reinsurance recapture, we accelerated capital management in the quarter with 350 million in buybacks. We continue to view share repurchases as an excellent use of capital and expect to exceed the 650 million we\u2019ve put to work in 2014.","Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority and as a result, we expect to go to the Board in a few weeks to ask for an increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with our past practices. Statutory surplus stands at 8.5 billion and we estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 515%, down from year end as we paid 400 million in dividends to the holding company. Holding company cash ended the quarter at nearly 800 million.","Finally, in March, we completed a $300 million debt offering, the proceeds which will be used to retire the 250 million of debt due in June. We remain comfortable with our leverage and capital structure.","So wrapping things up, earnings came up a bit short to start the year, but we remain very confident looking forward. In addition to the strong franchise highlighted by Dennis, we are encouraged by our belief that elevated mortality in the first quarter is driven by seasonality, consistent with our past experience in prior years and that we will see better mortality in Individual Life results over the remainder of the year.","The improvements we saw in underlying disability trends that led to a meaningful sequential decrease in our disability loss ratio and finally, the strength of our balance sheet and strong capital generation, which allows us to continue actively deploying capital.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks and good morning. First question on the DOL for fiduciary standards, I appreciate that it\u2019s still early days but I just wanted to get a high-level sense, maybe from Dennis, how you think this could impact your annuities and RPS business? And then specifically related to annuities, could this move the industry back towards offering more living benefit guarantees in order to improve the value proposition of the variable annuity? Thanks.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, Suneet, I think it is complicated and there\u2019s lot yet to be revealed in terms of the final changes here. I do think, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll repeat what I said in my remarks and that is that we believe there will be some change but we think that Lincoln, because of our scale, broad set of product offerings and strong and diverse distribution franchises with a proven ability to pivot in response to market or regulated changes will be able \u2013 will therefore be able to navigate through whatever comes down the road.","But having said that, let me dig a little bit deeper into your question and first talk about annuities. So one of the big issues, one of the overarching issues in this document is how agents get paid, fees versus commissions. It\u2019s worth noting we currently offer fee-based products that meet the fiduciary standard of providing investment advice. As an example, our BA products are already set up to be sold as fee-based advisory products so we already have taken action. We\u2019ll continue to respond to changes, be it through law or needs and preferences from our distribution partner. So that\u2019s important.","Sticking with annuities, we\u2019ve always been known more for our non-qualified competitive positioning due to our patented Eye for Life income feature, specifically VAs 58% of what we sell is non-qualified and 42% are qualified, and we think this is probably a little better than the industry average. With respect to nonliving benefits, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be any reduction in the pace of our growth in that product. So that\u2019s a specific answer on that as well.","And then finally, on RPS, there\u2019s a lot of issues. I think the bigger retirement companies have touched on them. I think our bottom line is we think that we\u2019ll be able to respond to changes and we may have to make some changes in the way we do business. But we don\u2019t see this as a significant hurdle for continuing to grow that business. And let me just stop there.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I did want to ask another one on captives. Just in terms of what you\u2019re hearing around regulatory review, variable annuity captives, if you can update us on that. And then also, maybe for Randy, if you can remind us, how you \u2013 what kind of assets do you have in the captive letters of credit exposure, those kinds of things? Thanks.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, let me start by reminding all of us that we just finished \u2013 we being the industry and the regulators \u2013 a long, thoughtful process around captive regulations for A Triple X and Triple X and that turned out pretty good, both from a regulatory standpoint and from the perspective of the industry. So, I\u2019m kind of encouraged by the fact that we just went through this with them.","Once again, Lincoln is taking sort of a leading role in the discussions with respect to VA captives. Once again, good news in terms of the process, similar to what the regulators did on A Triple X, Triple X. They are hiring a couple of outside consultants to bring more perspective and help them as they look at this issue.","In this case of VA captives, the difficulty is that you have a regulatory regime that is more on a book value basis and you have economics of the policy more on the basis of fair market and sort of more GAAP economics. So the companies have to choose and we\u2019ve talked about balance sheet risk, they have to choose between hedging to protect yourself or to build assets to pay future claims. And then you can at the same time protect against some potential swings in, I\u2019ll call, statutory capital calls related to extreme economic scenarios.","So I\u2019m optimistic that maybe we\u2019ll be able to craft a solution with the regulators that sort of mitigates this tug and pull between that economics. And maybe, this is being a bit optimistic, we won\u2019t need VA captives if we can get that at all, if we can get that problem solved. So the process is underway. I\u2019m encouraged with what I hear being said by the regulators and what they\u2019ve already accomplished, and we\u2019ll see where it turns out.","Randal J. Freitag","Suneet, hi, this is Randy. We remain very well positioned from an asset standpoint in the VA captive. I believe at the end of the quarter, our assets exceeded our hedge target by roughly $1.5 billion, so I think that\u2019s a story that continues to differentiate us as a company. So very well positioned from where we sit.","If you remember, and Dennis sort of described it in his discussion, the main risk around this is the difference that can emerge between statutory liabilities and economic liabilities in certain economic environments. It\u2019s really only that hot economic environment, which is primarily a big spike in interest rates, which would cause us to use anything but the hard assets that we currently use today.","So what makes up our current hedge assets, it\u2019s the value of the derivative assets we hold, some bonds that we hold in there, but we\u2019re currently using what you would describe as soft assets.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. One last one for Dennis. In terms of your regulatory discussions, I mean I think on Triple X and A Triple X, the regulators took a view of sort of a prospective approach to this as opposed to a retroactive. Is that your sense in terms of having an approach VA captives, or is it too early to tell on that? Thanks.","Dennis R. Glass","All the conversation is around prospective. I think if you look back historically in the insurance industry, the regulatory framework very seldomly do make things retroactive. Clearly, in the specific case of A Triple X, Triple X, there was no retroactivity but I would hope that it would be forward-looking but I can\u2019t say definitively if it will or won\u2019t be, because we\u2019re not that far down the road.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. Good morning. One quick follow up, Randy. You mentioned the 1.5 billion of net assets in the captives. Can you tell us what the RBC impact would be if you did consolidate the captive at this point?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, it\u2019s not something we look at on a regular basis but it continues to be the same story, which is no negative impact on our LNL, RBC or life insurance company reported RBC if we were to bring our captives back in.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, got it. Then I want to move to capital management. In the past you talked about an interest in group benefits M&A. Would you feel comfortable making an acquisition in that space right now if the right opportunity presented itself given the challenges that you\u2019re working through in your own business?","Dennis R. Glass","Great question. What we\u2019ve said in the past was the following, and our attitude hasn\u2019t changed, which is we\u2019d like to increase morbidity earnings at the right time and probably within acquisition. We\u2019re not ruling out an acquisition now, but because of the difficulty we\u2019re having with our core business, it makes it harder to get over the hurdle of doing an acquisition. And then finally, quite clearly, anything we do in terms of acquisitions has to be measured against other sources of capital such as buying our shares back. So open-minded, but at the moment things would have to \u2013 at the moment there\u2019s some impediments. Not saying that we wouldn\u2019t do something but it\u2019d be harder to do it.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And then just last one, is the \u2013 I guess where do you feel like you could bring your RBC ratio down to in an M&A \u2013 if you were to do a larger M&A transaction, is around 450 still the right way to think about where you might be able to bring that to?","Randal J. Freitag","Ryan, I think it\u2019s the nature of the M&A deal you do. If it was a group deal, I think that\u2019s probably a reasonable estimate. I think the way we\u2019ve talked about this in the past is sort of, on our balance sheet we probably have capacity to do 750 million or so of M&A with existing capital from the balance sheet.","Dennis R. Glass","But again, I want to reinforce this issue that continuing to focus on share buybacks is a high priority for us. And that when we talk about excess capital, it\u2019s different as to whether you use that excess capital for share buybacks or for acquisitions in terms of the split, because when you do an acquisition, the capital stays in the company whereas share buybacks the capital goes out. So the excess capital can\u2019t all be used for share buybacks whereas morbid could be used for acquisitions.","Ryan Krueger","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Seth Weiss","Hi. Thank you. A clarification question on the $30 million adverse mortality hit. Just want to make sure this is relative to expectations for a seasonally higher 1Q. Is that correct?","Randal J. Freitag","That\u2019s sort of relative to our baseline expectations for a full year. So if you were to look at an average quarter during the year, 30 million would be what\u2019s over and above that number and it\u2019s really sort of consistent with what we\u2019ve experienced in the past. If I look at the A to E in the first quarter of this year, it\u2019s really no different than the A to E for the first quarter last year. So we didn\u2019t see anything abnormal in the seasonality. We just continue to grow and retain more business and I think that\u2019s why the number is bigger than last year\u2019s.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Thank you. And if I can move on to group and maybe a little bit more granularity here. If I were to normalize for the accelerated amortization and maybe add in a couple million more for mortality attributed there, we get to modest profitability but still under $5 million under a 1% margin. And last quarter you spoke about new claims management causing some pressure on incidents and recoveries but expectations to improve those claims management issues within the next 6 to 12 months. So could you speak about what claims management pressures you may have felt this quarter? And how progress on shoring up those issues is going?","Randal J. Freitag","Sure, Seth. You remember the original issues around claims management process arose when we installed the new system in the middle of next year, and that caused average caseloads per examiner to go up and some of the new process changes that went in place really caused sort of a backup. So we had some things that we needed to fix. As we said, it would be something that we\u2019d fix as we came into the second half of this year. We thought we\u2019d be where we needed to be.","I think we made significant improvement in this quarter and that really drove the significant improvement you saw on the disability loss ratio, as I mentioned it improve nearly 10 points, with a lot of that improvement directly attributable I believe to some of the improvements that we made in the claims management process. We still have a ways to go.","Specifically, I think we have more work to do on bringing average caseloads down per examiner. I think that\u2019s still to come. But we made a lot of the process improvements bringing in support for claims examiners, for instance, whether that\u2019s nursing support, whether that\u2019s support at the managerial level, or whatever it is. So we made a lot of process and supportive improvements, but we still have more to go I think before we get to where we need to be.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Thank you. And then if I could just do one quick one on capital, absent M&A, how should we think about bringing that RBC ratio down over time, which at 515, I think is still quite high relative to peers?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I think it\u2019s still high and I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, the way we\u2019ve been deploying capital, we expect it to come down. There have been some items which have been favorable, whether it was the impact of the reinsurance recapture in the fourth quarter or some favorable experience we had last year in the RMBS re-rating process, for instance. So there have been a number of things that have been favorable. But the way we\u2019re distributing capital, we continue to expect it to come down 10 to 15, 10 to 20 points a year, somewhere in that range.","Seth Weiss","Okay. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag","You bet.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. First question is just on the adverse mortality this quarter. Can you comment on whether \u2013 or what impact you saw from the recapture block this quarter? Did that contribute to the weakness? And if so, how much?","Randal J. Freitag","Hi, Tom. Yes, I mean it contributed overall to the elevated mortality experience. So, as we mentioned, in bringing in that book of business, we expect it similar to experience for the rest of our book and we saw that. As I mentioned, overall, we had an actual to expected experience. In this quarter that was very similar to the first quarter of 2014. So there was no big impact from that.","Doing the recapture increased the average pay size of our policy and was going to create a little more volatility. And in a quarter where you have bad experience that increased mortality \u2013 that increased volatility, means you\u2019re going to have more claims, more bad experience, and we had that, the 30 million versus the first 18 million we had last year. So there\u2019s really no differentiated impact from the recapture business compared to what we\u2019ve experienced in prior years first quarters.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. So, Randy, essentially contributed its fair share as a percent of the total block but nothing beyond that. Is that a fair characterization?","Randal J. Freitag","That\u2019s a very fair characterization.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. And then one follow up. Dennis, the comment you made on living, or VA sales outliving benefit guarantees. I guess my question there is, what percent of those sales are coming from qualified sources? Is it similar to your overall mix in the low 40% range? And would you see those sales as potentially vulnerable or potentially getting overhauls, just considering the value proposition that maybe harder to prove under a fiduciary standards threshold?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Tom, let me repeat the question. What percentage of our nonguaranteed business is coming from qualified plans?","Thomas Gallagher","That\u2019s right. Yes.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. The answer to that is about 25% is coming from qualified plans and 75% from nonqualified plans.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And do you think that 25%, just considering what\u2019s happening here and understanding the technicalities of the proposal are yet to be determined, but if you think about the spirit of what\u2019s being proposed here, would you expect that 25% potentially going away?","Dennis R. Glass","Tom, that\u2019s a very specific question and it\u2019s actually a question that is probably more appropriate for the broad distribution organizations. We have such different alternatives to sell product, different distribution systems and channels, as you know. We don\u2019t think that there is a serious risk to that 25% but it may end up coming from different channels than it\u2019s coming from today. So I fall back on our comment; broad, diversified distribution and our proven ability to pivot, whether it\u2019s for customer preferences, pricing issues or regulatory reasons. And that we\u2019ll find a way with this distribution organization to continue to grow our sales.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Steven Schwartz","Hi. Good morning, everybody. To follow up a little bit on Tom\u2019s question. I\u2019m interested in, Dennis, if you know what percentage of your VA sales are in upfront commission as opposed to fee-based? Let\u2019s just put it that way simply in today\u2019s world, how are they sold?","Dennis R. Glass","I\u2019m trying to get an answer for that. The vast majority are sold on an upfront commission basis.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, all right. And then, Dennis, you talked a little bit about sales and how they picked up --","Dennis R. Glass","Could I come to back and again reinforce the fact of how you pay the agents is really determined by our distribution channels. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are prepared already to sell these same VA products on a fee basis rather than frontend commission. And I want to reemphasize another point, which we\u2019ve made in the past, living benefit products are an important part of the retirement planning for Americans, and I don\u2019t see the demand for that product going away even though companies and distribution organizations may have to adjust the way they get it to the consumer.","Steven Schwartz","Yes, I mean it\u2019s a good point, it\u2019s not really your issue. You can do it. It\u2019s a question of whether broker-dealers and brokers want to sell that way or not and maybe they\u2019ll have to. That\u2019s all out there. That\u2019s why I asked the question.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes.","Steven Schwartz","Then during your prepared remarks, you talked about how sales both in annuities and life insurance picked up in the quarter and continue to pick up. I think you referenced maybe new products or revisions to older products, if you could fill that out please.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. I think the pickup is just related to better productivity. There\u2019s been some product changes but I wouldn\u2019t attribute the pickup to any specific product. There\u2019s nothing dramatic in the way of product improvements that would have led to that 15% pickup. I just think we got off to a slower start and we are now back to where we think we \u2013 at levels of sales that are more consistent with our expectations for the rest \u2013 a higher level of sales.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. And the last one for Randy, I think maybe Seth asked this question. The adverse mortality that you\u2019re pointing to is relative to what you\u2019d expect on average for the year, I get that. But we know the first quarter is always going to have bad weather. We know the first quarter is always going to have the flu season. We\u2019ve got the Christmas effect. So do you have a sense, Randy, of generally speaking, what you would consider to be \u2013 I\u2019d call it normal adverse mortality in the first quarter relative to your baseline?","Randal J. Freitag","Steven, obviously it\u2019s a tough number estimate if you ask me to sort of take a stab at it. Maybe half of the $30 million was sort of over and above a normal seasonal first quarter, but put a big confidence interval around that number.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I guess first just wanted to follow up on I think what Seth was asking on the group side. Have recent results changed your view at all? And how long it will take group results to recover and get back to I think the 5% to 6% margin you\u2019ve targeted on a run rate bases, or do you think we\u2019re just seeing more negative noise related to DAC and mortality and other factors? But kind of the timing of getting to the end goal hasn\u2019t changed.","Randal J. Freitag","I did say in my remarks that our expectations with respect to getting back to good margins haven\u2019t changed. It\u2019s sort of late 2016, early 2017. So that hasn\u2019t changed.","Erik Bass","Got it. And that\u2019s on a run rate bases?","Randal J. Freitag","Right.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then maybe can ask one on variable annuities. Have you seen much impact from increased competition as other insurers have rolled out both new guarantee features as well as products without living benefits or is your sense that the overall industry demand for VAs just ticked down a little bit in the first quarter?","Dennis R. Glass","I think it ticked down a little bit in the first quarter, as you say. We continue to have what I would refer to as rational competition in this market right now. Different companies have different value propositions, different features and, at any point in time, you can see one get ahead of the other for whatever reason. But we\u2019re a strong, consistent player. We\u2019ll continue to get our fair share. Overall, our cost and benefits are consistent with what other carriers are offering. And then we have the benefit of the best wholesaling force we think in the country. So, we\u2019ll continue to get our fair share on our terms.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you and good morning. Just want to follow on the Group Protection in terms of the DAC amortization. Can you just remind us, in any given years what is the pattern for your renewal cycle? So what percentage of your business in any given year go through the Jan 1 renewal cycle versus the July 1 cycle?","Randal J. Freitag","So let\u2019s start out with your typical group contract is about a three-year guarantee, so maybe about a 30-year business is going through in any particular year. Inside of that, roughly 60% or so is in the \u2013 50% to 60% is in the first quarter of the year. And then our second biggest would be the third quarter for July renewals.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then how should we kind of compare the July renewal to kind of the rest of the pattern?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I think as I said 50% to 60% the first quarter and the third quarter is the next biggest. But, look, the bulk of it is in the first quarter of the year and I\u2019ll just stop right there.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. And then in terms of your retirement plan services, Lincoln\u2019s always been a strong player in the 403(b) market. Can you remind us what percentage of your retirement plan services is in the 403(b) market?","Dennis R. Glass","What percentage of sales are in the 403(b) market?","Humphrey Lee","Maybe an account value as well?","Dennis R. Glass","About 50%.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. So basically those would not be affected by the fiduciary proposal, but the remaining 50% could potentially be affected?","Dennis R. Glass","Again, in the retirement business and in our other businesses, we think we can continue to sell through regulatory changes. And some of the regulatory changes by the way that are being proposed, we\u2019ve been advocates for some time. So, yes, I understand there\u2019s a lot of questions about it. There\u2019s going to be change. Good companies will react to the change. Both the living benefit products and retirement products are in big demand and so it\u2019s more about the changes you have to make in the selling process, commissions and so forth to be able to meet the demands of the marketplace, which will continue to be strong.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Your line is now open.","Randy Binner","Hi, thanks. Mostly asked and answered, so I\u2019m going to ask a DOL fiduciary follow up for Dennis. There\u2019s different pieces of the conversation here that have talked about kind of a potential, I call it bifurcation of regulation, whereas if a product is affected by ERISA, it would have a certain set of rules. And then if it\u2019s not, it wouldn\u2019t. So whether it was Humphrey\u2019s question or I think Tom Gallagher\u2019s before that on qualified, nonqualified.","I guess my question for you, Dennis, is your perspective on it if that would be feasible in the market that you would have kind of dramatically different rules based on whether it kind of hit the ERISA format or not or if there would be kind of a lowest common denominator effect in the market and everyone would \u2013 everything would kind of migrate towards whatever the new rules are pushed by DOL?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, I think that\u2019s hard to predict.","Randy Binner","Okay. I thought I\u2019d take a try at that. The one other follow up I had just on the group piece was after this first quarter renewal, how much of the book has been re-priced since you started the last major re-pricing initiative? I think it was 30% at the fourth quarter. Do you have a figure of how much has been re-priced at this point?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. So as we mentioned earlier, 30% went through the pipe last year and I think by the end of this year will be at about 80%. As we mentioned, 50% to 60% of this year\u2019s goes through in the first quarter. So if you sort of do the math there and apply that, roughly 50% of the premium has went through the pipeline.","Randy Binner","Halfway done. Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much. I\u2019d like to return to the two topics that have sort of been dominant in this call, mainly being the mortality and the group insurance. On the individual side, I just want to sort of sharpen my understanding once and for all of what happened here. Randy, you said that actual to expecteds were similar this year to last year. I guess what I\u2019d like to know is, were they both above 100% this year and last year?","Randal J. Freitag","No, they\u2019re not above 100%. So typically for a year, our actual to expected is going to be in the 80s. And what we\u2019ve seen over the past years in the first quarter is that it\u2019s roughly 10 points higher than that in the first quarter. And that\u2019s what we experienced again this year.","Eric Berg","Okay. I\u2019ll have to circle back because I don\u2019t understand how you could \u2013 I\u2019ll circle back to Chris how you can expect something to be below your expectations. It doesn\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t get my mind around it.","Randal J. Freitag","Well, Eric, let me describe that a little bit maybe to inform you. It\u2019s because of how we calculate it. So for other business we\u2019ve sold in the last 15 years or so, we used the exact pricing expectations. We expect to be roughly in the 100% range. For all the old historic business, we used sort of a standard industry table. And so that number typically comes up somewhere below 100. So for everything that we\u2019ve sold recently, everything that we have really good data and records for, we used the exact pricing experience. And then for all the older business, we use more of an industry table. And that\u2019s why you end up with this blended number, which ends up below 100%.","Eric Berg","If I could ask you now about the group insurance. It\u2019s still not apparent to me \u2013 again, I\u2019d like to sharpen my understanding having listened closely to the last questions about what is not going well here in the following sense. You\u2019ve described the results as core and I think Randy, you described them as poor. But what we know is that there has been a significant improvement in incidence. There\u2019s been a significant improvement in recovery. You\u2019ve raised prices sharply. This has led to I guess lactation, which in turn has triggered a non-cash charge for the accelerated amortization of DAC. So given all that, you\u2019re losing customers as you expected, you\u2019re getting a better claims experience as you expected. What is not happening that you would like to have seen happened by now? Where are you behind?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, Eric, I think now we\u2019re getting into a little bit of semantics. Our comment simply we\u2019re disappointed in a negative quarter in the absolute. That\u2019s not a comment with respect to expectations of some of these things that you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019re just disappointed that we\u2019ve had a lost quarter.","Eric Berg","Okay.","Dennis R. Glass","And as we\u2019ve said all along, the progress that we\u2019re going to make here is not going to be linear. I apologize for repeating this. We still \u2013 there\u2019s nothing happened at this quarter that we haven\u2019t seen \u2013 excuse me, that changes our expectations as to getting closer to our margins late 2016, 2017.","I think it\u2019s fair to say, and I know that we\u2019ve been talking about price increases now for a couple of quarters, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have gotten much more aggressive in the last six months with our price increases than we did in the first six months. So it\u2019s not that \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the progress, but we\u2019re even getting better increases but those aren\u2019t going to show up for a little bit.","And don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s hard to remember that these price increases are going to flow in over time. You\u2019re not getting them all at one time. So I understand the question. There is a lot of variables. I guess we just fall back on we\u2019re making good progress and our expectations remain the same.","Eric Berg","That answers my question. Thank you very much.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are at the top of the hour. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you so much and thank you all for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions]","Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's fourth quarter earnings call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone.","Continued execution on strategic priorities produced strong fourth quarter and full year results with adjusted operating EPS of 9% compared to the prior year quarter and 13% excluding notable items for the full year. Adjusted ROE expanded another 40 basis points in 2018 to 13.5%.","As you know, we have a multi-year track record of equally strong financial results and are confident we can sustain this performance over time given the strength of our franchise and effective execution of key management initiatives including maximizing our diverse product portfolio and distribution advantages to sustain profitable top-line growth driving expense savings from both our digital programs and synergies from the Liberty acquisition. With the Liberty transaction, we also successfully increased the scale of our group business and the percentage of earnings from traditional insurance risks. Maintain superior risk management and leveraging the strength of our balance sheet and solid capital generation.","Let me touch on each of these. First on profitable top-line growth. Our powerful retail franchise benefited from management actions targeted towards expanding the product portfolio in attractive fast growing segments of the market and increasing the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution force. These tactics drove solid growth within all four businesses including the annuity business returning to positive net flows in the fourth quarter for the first time since 2015. Strong growth in life sales in the quarter contributing to the sixth consecutive year of individual life sales gains, three straight years of sales growth and group protection and record RPS deposits and net flows in 2018. The near-term sales outlook is encouraging and we expect further momentum in 2019.","Moving to expense savings. We have initiated two significant programs. A few years ago, we made a strategic decision to accelerate our investments in digital with a focus on enhancing the customer experience while also realizing expense savings. This initiative is progressing well and we expect savings to largely offset expenses in 2019 consistent with our prior target and material bottom-line savings to begin emerging in 2020. Separately, we are on pace to achieve our targeted expense savings from the Liberty acquisition by the end of 2019 a year ahead of plan and expect additional upside in 2020. When taken together, we ultimately expect total expense savings of approximately $250 million pre-tax.","Risk management has long been a strength of Lincoln and we continue to see strong performance. For example, in the fourth quarter, the variable annuity hedge program effectiveness was 95%, despite elevated market volatility. This is well ahead of pricing assumptions and better than prior periods that experienced significant volatility. This continues our consistent track record of no material financial impacts from either the hedging and the hedging program or our policyholder behavior assumptions.","When you also factor in disciplined asset liability matching and active credit risk management there is no doubt our overall risk management continues to be industry leading.","Lastly, on balance sheet strength and capital management, in 2018, we deployed approximately $2.5 billion of capital towards strategic transactions, buybacks and dividends. As we enter 2019, we remain well-capitalized, have steady free cash flow and are on stable or positive outlook with all the rating agencies. We are well positioned to continue to fund new business growth, attractive returns, while also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.","Now turning to the business lines starting with annuities. For the full year earnings increased 3% even after the effects of the Athene transaction driven by our high quality and growing book of business. Annuity sales were robust as our strategic decision to participate in more segments of the marketplace is enabling us to reach more customers and advisors.","For the full year, sales increased 42% to $12.4 billion and importantly new products and expanded distribution represented 52% of sales during the quarter. In addition to growth, our actions are also diversifying our sales mix and risk profile. This quarter sales were evenly balanced between variable annuities with living benefits, variable annuities without living benefit guarantees and fixed annuities.","The last time total annuity sales exceeded this quarter was the second quarter of 2013. And at that time a full 85% of sales were variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. During the quarter, fixed annuity sales benefited from product and distribution expansion and more than doubled to $1.3 billion as every distribution channel generated sales gains including significant growth in the bank and broker dealer channels.","Variable annuity sales also increased in the quarter. VAs with risk-managed funds remain the largest contributor to sales, however, our newest product and indexed variable annuity we just launched in May is not far behind representing 25% of VA sales during the fourth quarter. Notably, we accomplished our goal of returning to positive flows in the annuity business in the quarter with net inflows of $675 million including both positive flows in both fixed and variable.","For the full year, we saw nearly 200 basis point improvement in our organic growth rate. So a strong quarter and year for the annuity business as sales increased significantly and we returned to positive flows. Looking ahead, LIMRA forecast industry sales growth to continue in 2019 and we will be adding more products in distribution including our new distribution arrangement with Allstate which has significant potential.","We are confident sales momentum will continue and net flows will be positive for the full year. Retirement plan services, earnings increased by double digits in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Total deposits for the quarter were $2.2 billion. This capped a very strong year with total deposits of 18% over $10 billion driven by robust first year sales and high single-digit growth in recurring deposits.","The fourth quarter marked our 12 consecutive quarter of positive flows. For the full year, net flows totaled $2.5 billion up 76% from the prior year. Investments in our high touch and high tech digitally focused business model are leading to better outcomes for both plan sponsors and plan participants. This is resulting in sales growth, increases in employee contributions and excellent retention in both the small mid large markets.","Looking ahead we are well positioned to effectively compete in our target markets. While sales net flows can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, we expect another strong year in 2019.","Turning to life insurance. Earnings growth was solid in the quarter and contributed to a strong year where earnings increased 20%. Total life insurance sales in the quarter were 8% from the prior year as results benefited from gains across most of our individual life insurance products including VUL, IUL, UL and term.","For the full year the total individual life insurance sales increased 2% driven by strong growth in VUL. Total life insurance sales were down 4% as executive benefits sales were softer this year. As I have noted on recent earnings calls. We have initiatives in place to improve our competitive position and growth and you began to see early success of this strategy in the second half of the year. As we enter 2019, the outlook for life insurance business remains strong and we expect our growth momentum to continue driven by an increased focus on product diversification as we leverage our broad portfolio of customer solutions and distribution capabilities.","Turning to group protections. Results, earnings increased 150% over the prior year quarter driven by the Liberty acquisition benefits from tax reform and continued favorable loss ratios. For the full year, the after tax margin was 5.5% well ahead of targets we announced at the time of acquisition.","Fourth quarter sales were up modestly and full year sales grew 15% attributable to the acquisition which resulted in growth in life and disability product lines and both employer and employee paid sales. Post acquisition premiums doubled compared to the prior year quarter and also grew sequentially as persistency remains strong. We are optimistic about our ability to grow premiums by sustaining persistency trends and driving sales growth across all case sizes given our increased scale, broader distribution access and expanded capabilities while continuing to achieve our pricing targets.","In summary, we are pleased with another solid quarter and outstanding full year results. The highlight of the year was our acquisition of Liberty. We had talked about our interest in acquiring a group property for several years to help increase the size and scale of the group business and accelerate our strategy of diversifying our sources of earnings. I am happy we were patient as we found the best partner with Liberty. The integration remains on track and we look forward to leveraging our scale to grow the top-line, maintain strong risk results and improve expense efficiency.","Shifting to investment results, the investment portfolio remains in great shape and our differentiated multi-manager model is enabling us to proactively and successfully execute on key strategies. As the credit cycle extends, we have continued to focus on managing credit risk more defensively including some derisking. Since 2015, we have sold approximately $3.5 billion within sectors and securities that have greater risk of deterioration under stress scenarios.","Additionally, we have been increasing our diversification into asset classes and industries that are high quality and expected to be less exposed to economic cycles. Examples, include reducing our consumer cyclical and commodity related fixed income holdings and increasing our exposure to consumer staples, infrastructure and municipals.","We have also increased our allocation to commercial mortgage loans, constructing a portfolio that is well-diversified and high quality with loans closed in 2018 having an average loan to value of 54% and debt service coverage over two times. These actions are contributing to our below investment grade assets representing just 4% of our fixed income portfolio, while credit losses have been minimal.","During the quarter, we invested new money at an average yield of 4.5%. At this level, we are within 20 basis points of the portfolio yield and continue to expect spread compression to abate. And finally, our alternatives investment portfolio continues to perform well. Achieving a 14% pre-tax annualized return for the year above our long-term targeted return of 10%.","So I am pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and record adjusted operating earnings per share in 2018. We enter 2019 with a lot of positive momentum notably. Organic growth drivers are strong and given our broad and growing product portfolio combined with the large and expanding distribution force, we expect these trends to continue.","Also our expense savings programs will begin to contribute more meaningfully this year and really kick in next year. When factoring in these targeted management actions combined with other EPS growth drivers such as modest tailwinds from the capital markets and share repurchases operating earnings per share growth could be above our 8% to 10% target beginning in 2020.","We will be holding an Investor Day in June and plan to update you on future drivers of our short and long-term financial results.","In closing, I'm very proud strategic management actions enable us to consistently deliver strong financial results. And I am confident our strategy and execution of key initiatives will enable this to continue.","Now I will turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis.","Last night, we reported adjusted income from operations of $475 million or $2.15 per share for the fourth quarter a 9% increase from the prior year. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, there were a few items that drove some variability within the Life Insurance segment, which I will speak to later.","Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics for 2018. Adjusted operating EPS of $8.48 was a record up 9% or 13% excluding notable items. As we combine growth in pre-tax earnings and benefits from tax reform with active capital management.","Adjusted operating ROE increased 40 basis points to 13.5%. Book value per share excluding AOCI increased 5% to $67.73 an all time high. Consolidated net flow is more than doubled to over $7 billion primarily driven by the significant improvement in annuities and record flows for RPS.","Operating revenues grew in every business segment. Expense management continued to be a good story as the G&A expense ratio improved to 20 basis points. And finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength highlighted by a high quality investment portfolio. Solid capital ratios and liquidity and strong capital generation which enabled us to deploy $2.5 billion of capital well above our expectations going into the year.","Net income of $1.80 for the quarter was impacted by $37 million loss from general account investments with the largest impact coming from the mark-to-market on equity investments and a $20 million acquisition and integration expense.","Now turning to segment results, starting with annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $258 million compared to $265 million in the prior year quarter. The most significant item impacting fourth quarter results was the reinsurance transaction completed with the Athene, which reduced earnings by $15 million.","Moving forward, we expect a similar impact in subsequent quarters and I will highlight the capital deployment benefits from the transaction later.","Total operating revenue decreased 7% from the prior year quarter due to an 8% decline in average account values primarily attributable to the Athene transaction. Average separate account values fell 3% in the quarter, but I would note that fee income fell less as we benefited from the fact that fees for living benefit guarantees are tied to the benefit base as opposed to account value reflective of the high quality product design in our living benefit portfolio.","G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased for the quarter and full year which resulted in the annuities expense ratio improving modestly on an annual basis. Return metrics remained strong in the quarter with ROA at 83 basis points and a 21% ROE both largely consistent with the full year. So the annuities business had an outstanding year, which culminated with returning to positive net flows in the fourth quarter leaving us well positioned to build on this momentum in 2019.","In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $45 million up 10% compared to the prior year. The earnings increase is attributable to benefits from tax reform and expense management. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased over 2% for the quarter and full year. When combined with an increase in annual operating revenues, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points in 2018.","Positive net flows of $2.5 billion for the full year helped drive average account values to $70 billion in the quarter up 5%. Base spread excluding variable investment income compressed 11 basis point versus the prior year quarter at the low end of our guidance range. ROA came in at 26 basis points slightly ahead of the prior year. 2018 was a great year for the retirement business highlighted by consistently strong net flows and earnings, solid momentum in sales and further expense management should serve as positive drivers for the retirement business.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of $175 million increased 15% from the prior year quarter attributable to benefits from tax reform. Other items impacting earnings in the quarter includes strong variable investment income offset by unfavorable mortality. Additionally, the quarter benefited from a $16 million adjustment to pass deferrals, which was mostly offset by a basket of smaller one-offs. Combined these items and added to a $4 million benefit to earnings.","As I noted, mortality was unfavorable in the quarter impacting earnings by $28 million relative to a more typical fourth quarter. For the full year, mortality was uneventful as both frequency and severity came in at 100%. In fact, mortality has been within 1% of annual expectations in 7 of the last 8 years.","Underlying earnings drivers were solid with average account values and average life insurance in force both up 3% over the prior year quarter. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 9% in the quarter and 7% for the year. Combined with a 6% increase in annual operating revenues, the expense ratio improved 90 basis points.","Base spreads excluding variable investment income were down 10 basis points year-over-year at the high-end of our expectations. So a strong year for the life business as steady driver growth and good expense management drove an increase in pre-tax earnings. And looking ahead, we expect sales momentum to build in 2019.","Group protection reported earnings of $50 million compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily coming from the Liberty acquisition and benefits from tax reform. The after-tax margin was just under 5% in the quarter and 5.5% for the full year. Both well ahead of expectations we established when we announced the Liberty acquisition about a year ago. Compared to 2017, the full year margin improved 30 basis points.","The loss ratio in the fourth quarter was 75.8%. Overall risk results remained favorable. But the quarter did reflect typical seasonality in the disability product line, which drove the sequential increase in the loss ratio. As a reminder, the year-over-year increases and loss ratios reflect the impact from the acquisition as we combine two blocks of business with different loss characteristics.","It was an excellent year for group protection as business trends remain favorable and the Liberty integration is going well. We continue to believe we can sustain margins within our 5% to 7% target and are optimistic that the upper half of the range is achievable over time as we execute on our pricing, growth and expense saving initiatives.","Turning to capital and capital management. We ended the year with $9.5 billion of statutory surplus and the RBC ratio of approximately 455% which includes the previously communicated [4 point] [ph] negative impact from the change in after-tax RBC factors.","Additionally, our capital and RBC ratio include approximately $700 million and 35 basis points from goodwill associated with the Liberty transaction that will go away at the completion of a legal entity merger. Holding company cash remains above our $450 million target.","During the quarter, we returned $605 million of capital to shareholders. Share buybacks totaled $535 million which included typical quarterly buybacks and 80% of estimated repurchases from our accelerated share repurchase program of $450 million that we commenced in December with the capital generated from the annuity reinsurance transaction.","First quarter average diluted share count will reflect a meaningful benefit from the ASR. And as a reminder, we expect the transaction to be accretive to EPS in 2019 and beyond.","Looking ahead, we expect free cash flow generation of approximately $850 million to $950 million this year consistent with our prior guidance. We continue to focus on investing in new business growth at attractive returns, while also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders, both of which will help drive long-term shareholder value.","To conclude, 2018 was an excellent year and it's consistent with a proven results, we have reported for several years. In fact, over the past five years, adjusted operating revenues have increased at a 6% rate. Adjusted ROE has expanded 140 basis points, book value per share excluding AOCI has grown at an 8% rate and adjusted operating EPS has increased at an 11% rate outperforming our EPS growth target. And as we look forward we are well positioned to continue delivering strong financial results.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up and then re-queue if you have additional questions. With that, Crystal, could we begin Q&A","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, good morning. I had a first question on expenses. The $200 million total cost saves that you expect, is it -- that would be comparable to prior combined guidance I believe of 190 to 250, so the high-end of that I guess is that correct. And is 2021 still the year you expect to achieve it?","Randy Freitag","Ryan let me walk through and break that down into the two component parts. One half is the digital program and that program is running spot-on with what we originally guided you to. So what was that original guidance? We have an expectation that as we enter 2019, expenses will be in the $70 million to $80 million range and the benefits will equal that amount. So we'll be about net neutral in 2019 after the expenses will continue to trend down. The benefits will continue to grow and we'll grow ultimately to that $90 million to $150 million range.","On the other side, you have the integration savings associated with the Liberty acquisition. We experienced about $50 million of those savings in 2018 and as we move into 2019, we currently expect to exit the year at $100 million run rate. That's one year ahead of our original expectations. Additionally, as we've examined and tightened up the integration plan, we now believe that we can grow that original guidance of $100 million to $125 million in the out years. Those are the numbers that get you to the total run.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thank you. And then, now that you've completed the fixed annuity reinsurance transaction, your stock still trades at a pretty low multiple. Would you consider a similar type of transaction for a piece of the individual life block if your valuation remains at these levels.","Dennis Glass","Ryan, we're always open to transactions that have the long-term improvement in shareholder value. So the answer is, yes, that we'll continue to look at them.","Ryan Krueger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a question related to the ROA annuities and I think in Randy's prepared remarks, you've talked about expenses were down and you have a good book of business that [indiscernible] to the 83 basis point of ROA, which I find is still pretty strong given the adverse market and probably you have set a little bit of higher fixed unit cost after the transaction. I was just wondering, if you can go a little bit more detail in terms of the strong performance and do you think if the current level is sustainable in the current market environment?","RandyFreitag","Humphrey, thanks for the question. Yes, I mean we continue to expect and it's very consistent ROAs story over the years. It has been in that 75 to 85 basis point ROA range for as long as I can remember. As we look forward, we continue to see consistency in our ROA expectations going forward.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then shifting to retirement plan services same thing you talked about expense initiatives helping the G&A expense ratio and balance benefiting the ROA. But I think the 26 basis point is probably one of the highest with all the benefits of VII. Do you think that 26 basis points for RPS is a sustainable number going forward?","Randy Freitag","I think it's in the range. I think it was a good quarter for their RPS business as I said, $5 million variance was a good strong quarter and it led to the 26 basis point ROA. I don't think that the ROA as we look forward, there's a range of ROA expectations, I think 26 is probably at the top-end of that range. But it's not outside of the norm that we would expect from that business.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner from B Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So I have a question in group protection and I think that's got addressed a little bit in the opening comments. I don't want to dig in because the -- I guess the timing of -- how the margin comes in the group protection business? And then, kind of what -- now that the Liberty deal is kind of in fully, how to think about the benefit ratio there? The benefit is a little higher than I thought it would be this quarter. I'm just wondering, if there is a seasonality, or any other kind of timing elements to how that margin and benefit ratio develops going forward.","Randy Freitag","Hi, Randy. First I mentioned that there was a little bit of seasonality in our loss ratio. Let me dig into that a little bit. If you go back to the third quarter, we reported a loss ratio of 73.6%. But, as we also mentioned, we had a benefit from our reserve review. So if you adjusted for that the loss ratio in the third quarter was 74.5%. We experienced 75.8% in the fourth quarter. One, I mean those numbers at the end the day for a big business that's not a big difference, so it's not like there was a real fundamental change in the loss ratio, I would say.","We do typically experience a little bit of seasonality in our disability business in the fourth quarter, negative seasonality. If I had to pinpoint why exactly that is, I think as you think about claims and management especially around the holidays whether it's staffing levels here at Lincoln or whether it's staffing levels at the doctors either from our client standpoint or even our own doctors as he work with those. I think there's a little bit of a slowdown in claims management process around the holidays. If I had to highlight one thing, I think that's why we typically have a little bit of seasonality. So I think 75.8% as we said, it's a good solid result and it's well within our, once again, our range of expectations for that business.","And as a reminder, we came into the year saying we were going to have an overall margin in the group business of 3.5% for the year. We did 5.5%. So it was a really good year for the group business. And as I said looking forward, we continue to think we can operate in that 5% to 7% range ultimately growing into the upper half of that range.","Randy Binner","And expenses seem like they're trending better, right? So is that a lever you continue to pull there as we look for?","Randy Freitag","Back to the answer on Ryan's question, we experienced about $50 million of the integration savings in 2018. We expect to exit 2019 at $100 million run rate and ultimately move to $125 million. So absolutely expenses are going to be one of the items that benefit earnings as you we look forward.","Randy Binner","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Randy, the adverse mortality in individual life insurance this quarter, I guess that's the first time Lincoln has had that in about two to three years. The rest of the industry saw the same thing more or less. Any thoughts on what happened here? Any concerns for you? Do you think it's just normal volatility? Have you dug in there a little bit?","Randy Freitag","Well, Tom let me accelerate to the [NSA] [ph]. Yes, I think it was just normal volatility. I like you and many others when I saw the result for the quarter was disappointed and so dug into the quarterly results and what we found was nothing really extraordinary outside of just bad results. So frequency was a little bit elevated, severity was a little bit elevated. There wasn't anything inside from a type of cause of death standpoint. So there wasn't anything that stood out in terms of the quarter other than just one of those quarters where experience came in a little worse than expected.","Now if I expanded that view out and thought about it on a broader standpoint, I'd point out in the third quarter, we were about $20 million better than our expectations versus the $28 million negative that we experienced in the fourth quarter. So combined those two quarters we're pretty close to our expectations.","One of the other phenomena we saw in the fourth quarter and this is really the first time we've experienced this in my memory was that about a third of the experience in the fourth -- negative experience in the fourth quarter came from third quarter claims lag. So we establish an IBNR at the end of every quarter. And once we test that thing over time, typically we come within a few million dollars, but this quarter as I mentioned about a third of that $28 million came from an IBNR that was a little lower in retrospect than it should have been at the end of the third quarter.","So you know viewed from the last half the year, I think you came much more in line with our expectations. And then, when I viewed over a longer period of time, so as I got out of the quarter and I started to look into much longer period of time whether it's the full year as I mentioned severity and frequency both at 100% as I viewed over an eight year period and as I mentioned seven of the last eight years within 1 percentage point of 100%.","So when viewed over that longer period of time and viewed in a reflection of what mortality is, I find that quarter to be unremarkable other than it was one of those quarters when experienced just with a little worse than our expectations. But, once again, we don't expect quarterly performance to always fall exactly within a particular range, but when viewed over a longer period of time we do and that's what we experienced.","Thomas Gallagher","That's helpful especially the IBNR comment that would make sense why when you -- if you smooth that piece of it out between 3Q and 4Q wouldn't have been as exaggerated between the quarters. The other -- my follow-up is on variable annuity earnings and hedging. Can you comment on your variable annuity fees? How much is based on AUM versus guaranteed amount? And then, also has the recent market volatility altered hedging costs at all as we think about go forward earnings and margins there?","Randy Freitag","Hey, Tom. The base fee, so the [M&E] [ph] that's driven by account values. The fee is for the living benefit guarantees on the vast majority of our products are linked to the guaranteed benefit base. So that's your differentiation between those two fees. I think the primary driver to the second part of your question, the primary driver of the cost of hedging is going to be the level of interest rates. And so the interest rates have come down a little bit and that has pushed the cost of hedging up a little bit still within our range. If you expanded that out to what do we see across the industry, we continue to see -- I think a reasonably priced industry with most competitors behaving what we would call as rationally.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. Good morning. So just a question for Randy on RBC ratios obviously the tax reform they've come down a lot for most companies and your RBC is considerably higher than the peer levels. But I guess to some extent your business makes warrants that as well, but what do you view as a reasonable RBC threshold going forward versus where you stand right now?","Randy Freitag","Jimmy, thanks for the question. First I want to reiterate, this was in my comments, but I want to make sure everybody understands that the 455% RBC ratio that we reported included a 35 point benefit from goodwill associated with the acquisition of the Liberty Group business. In that acquisition we bought a legal entity and when you do a legal entity for statutory purposes, the excess of the purchase price over the book value of that entity gets recorded as goodwill, which then gets amortized off over the next 10 years.","Additionally, if you merge that entity out of existence which we intend to do over the next few years that goodwill will go away. So that's a -- what I would describe as a non-economic component of our 455% RBC ratio, adjust for that in your 420%.","So let's talk about that number. Everything about that number is consistent to a little better than our expectations when we went through a fairly rigorous review process with the rating agencies around the Liberty acquisition. And ultimately it's the rating agencies who really drive capital -- required capital needs and expectations as we continue to operate as a AA company. So I find that 420%, which as I said is a little better than the productivity formas we put together at the time of the integration when our ratings were reaffirmed. And as we sit here on this table, outlook pretty much across the board with our agency partners.","So the upshot of that is that I would expect over time that about 400% is the right number for us during periods what I would call the good times and of course that ratio then drifts down a bit during times of stress and that gets built back up during the good times. Well, I think the numbers probably about 400% ultimately driven by the rating agency models.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just on the sort of portfolio yields, I guess the new money yields gone up over the past year might have come down a little bit recently, but what's the difference between your portfolio yield and the bonds that are getting pulling off. And when do you get to a point where you think sort of spread compression will cease to exist in your business?","Dennis Glass","Jimmy, so I've mentioned in my remarks that we're putting new money on at about 4.5% in the fourth quarter and that the fixed income book -- portfolio book yields about 466. As we've mentioned in 2019 and into 2020, we're seeing a little higher yield on those assets that are running off. But we still expect spread compression to abate completely as we exit 2020. And I'd also like to mention that the amount of spread compression in terms of basis points was dramatically lower today than it was three years ago.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess if we set aside variable investment income which was elevated in the quarter. Randy how would you characterize the impact of a pretty severe market decline in the fourth quarter overall on your earnings. And it's kind of hard to discern it especially given some of the moving parts in the annuity segment with the Athene deal et cetera. Was there any real notable impact on your earnings this quarter?","Randy Freitag","Well, John, obviously the average S&P came down in the quarter and that had a negative impact. I'd estimate that impact on the annuity business for instance was $12 million, $13 million just on the quarter.","John Nadel","Okay.","Randy Freitag","As you exited the year, if you are sitting there on January 1, you would have had further negative impact at the end of quarter account value were below the average for the quarter. Now subsequent to January 1, we've had a recovery in the equity market. So as you sit here today, I think if you looked at the average S&P and you took really S&P as today and projected it out to the end of the quarter held at level to the end of quarter. you'd have a relatively modest decrease in the average level of the S&P. So there would be some additional headwind, but it's a lot lower than it was back at the beginning of the year.","There would have been less of an impact on the retirement business, but there would have been a small negative impact on the retirement business in the fourth quarter also from the level of the equity markets [indiscernible] the same comments as you move into 2019. So that's what I would say about both the equity markets and I think as Dennis pointed out, as you move into the first quarter, it's tough to say exactly what the variable investment income portfolio will do. But one of the leading indicators for that portfolio is the level of the equity markets and so you would expect a bit of a headwind in the first quarter from that particular component.","John Nadel","Yes. That's helpful. And then if I think about that $12 million or $13 million, I know it's an inexact science Randy, but if I think about that is there. How much of that was on the fee revenue side versus direct amortization. I'm thinking about the cushion that you guys have in the corridor on the annuity deck and how much of that might have gotten eaten up.","Randy Freitag","I would say during the quarter about 100% of it was on the fee income. So our quarter operated as it was supposed to do in the quarter. We came into the quarter with a couple of hundred million dollars of cushion. Most of that got taken away by the 15% downdraft in the equity markets. It's probably growing back up again as the markets have recovered here in the first quarter. But, all of the impact I would say is on the fee income side.","John Nadel","Got you. That's really helpful. And I just want to say I thought the prepared remarks and the commentary on the call were just terrific and I think some others should maybe pay attention to you guys. Thanks.","Randy Freitag","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hey, good morning. I was just hoping you could provide an update on some of the things you're doing in the distribution channels in the annuity segment. Could you talk about how much -- how far down the path of building out the wholesalers and sort of expanding into IMOs, I mean is there continued momentum here. Have you gotten a lot of that work behind you? Any color would be helpful.","Dennis Glass","Yes. That's a pretty Alex broad question, but let me say that there is very significant distribution additions that we've made. One being example -- one example of that being Allstate and we have already built the Allstate wholesaler team. And I think that was 15 people about. So that's in place. Other areas where we have expanded distribution include IMOs. And we've built our wholesaler teams for that. The bank channel, we've increased our wholesalers for that.","So if I just look in aggregate, we've taken our wholesaler headcount in the annuity business from 236 in the fourth quarter of '17 up to 285 in the fourth quarter of '18, which is about a 21% increase. So that increase is consistent with incremental additions of distribution opportunities.","Alex Scott","Okay. That's helpful. Follow up question I had was, just on the RBC. I know you already made some comments on it, which were quite helpful. I guess as I look at a couple of the peers they have -- that are in variable annuities anyway, they're much higher RBC ratios and they're kind of telling us, don't look at that. There's a lot of noise in there and as we adopt the framework changes that will come down. Can you just talk about sort of how that will impact yours kind of think about that 420 or anything related to VA changes that will move that down or is that all sort of insulated from your offshore entity. Anyway to think about RBC as we think about the next couple of years that would be great.","Dennis Glass","The short answer, Alex, is no we don't expect any impact from the implementation of what has been called the Oliver Wyman approach. I want to reiterate that I think the whole process that we've gone through with the regulators and industry has been a textbook case in regulators and industry working together to create a better solution both for the regulatory side and for the company side.","So I applaud the states for the approach they took with that process. We don't expect an impact at Lincoln. Other than that we believe that statutory reserving and capitalization will be improved by this new approach.","Alex Scott","Perfect. I just want to make sure. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Eric Bass","Hi. Thank you. Can you just comment on group persistency trends around the year-end renewals and as we think about 1Q earnings, is there anything we should consider in terms of modeling the level of amortization?","Dennis Glass","Persistency generally is better than expectation and that has contributed to higher premiums than we have expected at this time from the combination of the companies. There is this amortization event that occurs in the first quarter. I think it is burning off a little bit, but I'll ask Randy to speak to that. This was separate from the ongoing operations.","Randy Freitag","Yes. Alex, if you go back two to three years, we used to have amortization seasonality that would lead to an additional $15 million to $20 million of amortization in the first quarter. We changed our approach a few years ago and so it's been grading down I would expect a modest increase in the amortization in the first quarter due to that process. But I would describe it as modest.","Eric Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then, can you remind this on the composition of your alternatives portfolio. And should we anticipate some headwinds in the first quarter from private equity holdings?","Dennis Glass","Broadly speaking 85% of our private portfolio is in private equities and 15% in hedge. Inside the 85% were well diversified in the types of investments that are in the 85%. As Randy has already mentioned, I will elaborate just one point. We record earnings on our portfolio on a one quarter lag. So that the effect in the fourth quarter equity markets will show up in the first quarter results. But again, we don't know exactly how much that is. And then, I will also say that given the fact that the equity markets have come back some of what we might see in the first quarter is already going to turn around in the second quarter. So it'll be weaker in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter also in total","But again, for the full year, we still think we'll get to our target of 10% just more of it'll come in the last three quarters and the first quarter.","Eric Bass","Got it makes sense.","Randy Freitag","Eric, this is Randy. Let me apologize. I think I might have referred to you by the wrong name and I apologize for that.","Eric Bass","No worries.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Thank you. There was a pretty meaningful drop in first year sales for RPS. Is there any commentary you have on that?","Randy Freitag","Just the variability of sales in general probably driven by the large case market where sales are lumpy or just because they're large sales.","John Barnidge","Okay. Then, how is conversations with producers changed over the last quarter from market volatility and the government shutdown?","Dennis Glass","I think across Lincoln, we haven't gotten too many specific comments about the impact of the government shutdown on our business.","John Barnidge","Okay. Thanks for your answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Duetsche bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Thank you. Just a follow up on Alex's question and talking about distribution a little bit, but of course your sales and annuities especially the variable kind are much better than your peers. If there are any product cycle issue, you have been changing your appetite, you to write stuff or is the marketplace is changing towards what you're selling, is their product design issues going on here or what do you think?","Dennis Glass","Yes. This is a very important question because it goes to sort of the theme in my and Randy's comments about us taking specific actions to improve top-line growth and the annuity business sort of was the textbook example of that for Lincoln. So if you go back three years, we defined our strategy in the annuity business as essentially being a manufacturer of guaranteed lifetime income. And I think in my remarks in 2013, 85% of what we sold at least in the guaranteed lifetime income space had guaranteed lifetime income, excuse me the variable annuity space 15% difference.","Will and his team and the company at large say that very specifically that we were going to broaden our strategic view of what products we'd manufacturer and sell in the broader annuity industry and we would first attack established market where there was significant volume of sales taking place. And so, as an example, we talked about this tremendous launch that we had this year with our index variable annuity. Well, the sales that we're getting in that total market aren't even at the market share that we would expect, once we get to our full market share. So that's one of the drivers.","In the bank market for fixed annuities, so is the same process. Yes, we did fix the annuities, but it wasn't a strategic focus. So we decided to focus more strategically there helped with a quick start because of the Athene transaction. But now we're established in that marketplace. So consistently you've seen us pivot from product to product. But this is more broadening our view on where we're going to participate and getting what I would refer to as the normal share in existing established markets, products, value propositions.","Josh Shanker","And do you think that -- over the coming year, do you think that your relative share of the pie is going to grow or the pie will stay relatively stationary while you grow or will both grow.","Dennis Glass","I think the pie is going to get bigger I mentioned across all annuities mentioned LIMRA has an industry expectation of growth. So that's only the second time I think in the last five or seven years where they had a growth expectation for the broader annuity market. I think, we'll continue to take share. And in general, I think annuities are going to continue to become more popular with savers just because of the demographics of where we sell that demographic bucket is growing quite a bit.","So we're pretty optimistic about the top-line for the industry and very optimistic about our ability to take share. And these comments are specific to the annuity as an example. But we're doing the same thing in the life insurance business. We're revisiting segments of the life insurance business where we don't have the market share as the number three provider of seller life insurance in the United States that we should have. And so that's going to help fuel our growth.","Josh Shanker","Well, good luck in the New Year. And thank you very much.","Dennis Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. If there was anyone left in the queue, the company will be able to follow-up with you later in the afternoon.","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Giovanni for any closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning as always we will take your questions on our Investor Relations line at 1800-237-2920 or via email at investorrelations@lfg.com. Thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day. Speakers, please stand by."],"13115":["Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  2, 2012  1:00 PM ET","Executives","Jim Sjoreen - Investor Relations Professional","Dennis R.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Jim Sjoreen. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's second quarter Earnings call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about liquidity and capital resources, premiums, deposits, expenses and income from operations, are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Also, presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, it was another excellent quarter for us with all of our businesses delivering solid results. Our strong performance underscored the strength of our franchise, flexibility of our balance sheet and the aggressive actions we continue to take in response to difficult macroeconomic trends. We expect that the tough macro conditions will continue as will the deliberate steps we are taking to keep us on track for delivering on our long-term goals and objectives.","Let me now share some highlights from the quarter. We ended the second quarter with operating return on equity at 12%, book value per share growth of 5%, income from operations per share of 8% and operating revenue growth of 2%, all clear indicators that we are delivering on the strategies we have discussed with you in the past.","Increased deposits and positive net flows in Retirement Plan Services, as well as strong top line results in Group Protection, demonstrate that our investments in talent, technology and distribution are yielding results.","In addition, although Life sales were mixed, we did experience strong results in the higher return products we had pivoted to the past several quarters. And finally, our strong capital position enabled us to repurchase another S150 million in shares. With our current valuation inconsistent with the actions we have taken and the results we have achieved, buying our shares is one of our best capital management uses.","Let me now comment on underlying businesses. Life Insurance sales for the quarter were $128 million, down from a year ago. This decline was expected as we've continued to be a leader in implementing pricing actions that respond to the low-interest rate environment. We are committed to taking additional action if conditions require us to do so.","In addition to making pricing adjustments, we've also continued our pivot to higher-return, less-interest-rate-sensitive products. Second quarter sales of these products, which include Variable Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life and Term, were up 20% from the prior year quarter.","Moving forward, our ability to keep pivoting to these products will be driven by the breadth, depth and capability of our distribution teams.","Turning to the annuity business. We are also responding to low interest rates and market volatility by implementing product changes on our variable annuity platform, by expanding our Protected Funds solutions and by adding new distribution partners and strengthening relations within existing networks. You have heard me say this before, but we are pleased with where we are positioned in the industry. We maintain a consistent market presence, and we remain more interested in offering products on our terms, and we are focused on taking market share.","Positive net flows from the second quarter helped drive annuity account balances of $90 billion, up 2% from a year ago. We continue to see strong results from our Protected Funds series, as evidenced by 65% of June variable annuity purchasers opting for this solution. Our Protected Funds remain a good solution for consumers because they can lower the volatility of their returns and a good offering for Lincoln because they reduce our hedging costs.","Our strategic partnership with Primerica also continues to be a source of growth and diversification. Indexed annuity sales in the second quarter via this network were $100 million, up from $25 million in the first quarter.","In our Retirement Plan Services business, we delivered solid results in the quarter with the benefits of our strategic investments taking deeper hold. Total deposits of 1.3 billion in the second quarter were up nearly 8% versus the prior year. We were also encouraged by our small market segment results, which saw an 18% increase in total deposits. This segment is an area of focus for us given its great growth dynamics and favorable return profile.","Net inflows in the quarter were $194 million compared to outflows of $178 million a year ago. This marked the fourth straight quarter of positive flows, driven by a combination of strong deposit growth and improved retention.","In Group Protection, second quarter sales were $89 million, representing a 33% increase from the year-ago quarter. Our sales continued to be broad-based with employers of fewer than 1,000 employees remaining a source of strength for us. Second quarter sales were also driven by the strategic actions we are taking in this business, including a 15% increase in Lincoln's feet on the street. This increase in sales reps contributed to a 20% increase in independent brokers selling the segment's products. Our deep distribution, combined with the product and service expertise we bring to market, continue to position us well to near and long-term opportunities in the Group space.","Staying on topic for a minute, distribution overall has long been a strength for Lincoln, one that we believe differentiates us from competitors. It remains core to driving our continued pivot to the higher-return products that yielded good results this quarter as well as enables us to continue to sell products on our terms. Our more than 8,000 agents and reps in retail, 500 worksite producers and almost 600 wholesalers in LFD have brought to Lincoln approximately 60,000 independent producers selling our products. We will continue to tap this deep resource to deliver good solutions to our clients.","Before I turn the call over to Randy, let me state once again that this was an excellent quarter. Our results were strong, and we remain focused on all levers that will incrementally help us to build earnings growth and return. As I mentioned, we have flexibility on our balance sheet to continue share repurchases, and we will continue to reshape our products as a means to generate strong new business returns. The credit profile in our investment portfolio is very strong, allowing us to take modest additional risk that will improve our investment yield. And while we will continue to make significant strategic investments across our business lines, we will also continue to take action to lower our baseline operating expenses.","The results we have produced over the last several quarters are strong. They reflect an unwavering commitment to our shareholders that we will take action that helps to ensure sustained growth and continued profitability.","With that, let me turn it over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $322 million or $1.09 per share for the second quarter. It was an excellent quarter that again demonstrated our ability to generate strong and improving results in the face of a challenging environment. Strong results across all 4 businesses were boosted by our alternative investment portfolio, which added 20 million to the quarter's results. Adjusting for this, normalized earnings came in at $1.03 per share.","Looking at key value drivers. Normalized operating return on equity of 11.3% and book value per share growth of 5.3% continued to perform very nicely. Operating revenue growth of 1.5% was muted as the daily average S&P grew only 2.4% year-over-year, while net investment income growth was negatively impacted by the interest rate environment.","Normalized operating EPS growth of 12% was helped by crediting rate actions in the Life, Annuity and Retirement businesses, which largely offset the decline in our earn rates; tight management of baseline expenses, that is expenses excluding strategic investments, which grew 3% year-over-year; and capital management as we repurchased 6.5 million shares during the quarter for a total investment of $150 million. All in all, a very, very good quarter.","Turning to net income. We reported income of $324 million or $1.10 per share. Net income benefited from a small net realized gain resulting from a positive NPR adjustment, which was offset by RMBS and CMBS related impairments, mark-to-market adjustments on trading securities and VA hedge performance. After tax impairment and other net realized losses of $33 million were consistent with the levels we have seen in preceding quarters.","The VA hedge program continued to perform very well, particularly in a volatile quarter with assets associated with the hedge program exceeding the liability by $450 million at the end of the quarter.","In my opinion, no single statistic better exemplifies that our program is uniformly recognized as a leader in the industry and its ability to continually develop and grow the assets required to fund the liability for the guaranteed benefits that we issued.","Before turning to segment results, let me comment on a couple of items, starting with the impact of today's interest rate environment. Previous guidance, which assumed a 10-year treasury rate of 2% was for an earnings impact of $50 million, $100 million and $150 million in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. Our revised guidance, which is based upon today's treasury rate environment and which includes actions that we have taken on credit rates, our new business pricing and which incorporates our actual experience for the first half of 2012 is for a smaller impact over the same period of approximately $10 million for the remainder of 2012, $75 million in 2013 and $140 million in 2014, representing a 25% reduction from the $300 million 3-year total of the previous guidance. I'd attribute most of the improvement in the projections to the actions that we've taken around credited rates and good performance in the investment portfolio.","Looking forward, while in the Life and Retirement business we are essentially out of room to cut crediting rates further, I do anticipate that there is room for further management actions to mitigate the bottom line impact primarily through expense management in the investment portfolio, where we have capacity to take on more risk after an extended period of risk reduction.","My previous guidance are no near to midterm impact on statutory capital remains unchanged by today's rate environment. As a reminder, we have estimated and continued to estimate an impact of up to $500 million in the second half of a 10-year period of low rates.","Looking at expenses. G&A grew $28 million or 7.7% from the second quarter of 2012 with approximately 60% of the growth attributable to strategic investments that we are making across the company, with a focus on the Group Protection and Retirement businesses. Of course, the positive impact of those investments can be seen in the results, with strong sales growth in both businesses driven by investments in distribution and technology. Moving forward, we will continue to manage baseline expenses very tightly, while growth at strategic spending will level off as we exit 2012.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $158 million or $146 million normalized due to better-than-expected alternative investment income and a favorable stack adjustment. Returns in the Annuity business were very strong, with an ROE of 20.4% and an ROA of 70 basis points. Interest spreads remain strong in the Annuity business. Looking forward, the Annuity business continues to have ample room for further crediting rate cuts. As a result, I expect little pressure on economic interest spreads with any decline due primarily to new business that we'll put on with lower required interest margins. I made this point last quarter, and I'll make it again: when operated in a responsible and disciplined way, which is our approach, the Annuity business is a high-return business, the value of which is not fully reflected in our share price.","Retirement Plan Services produced another solid quarter, with earnings of $38 million or $34 million normalized, and strong returns, with an ROE in excess of 15% and an ROA of 37 basis points. Interest spreads decreased in the quarter by approximately 7 basis points relative to the first quarter as new investments brought down the earned rate.","Looking forward, I'd expect to see spread compression of 20 to 25 basis points a year. We, of course, will not be standing still, and I fully expect that the strategic investments that we are making in the retirement business will fuel the growth needed to overcome the headwind of spread compression.","Turning to Life Insurance. We reported earnings of $138 million or $132 million after normalizing for strong alternative investment results. As I noted in my remarks on the first quarter call, Life earnings growth this year is affected by the multiple reserve financing transactions that we did last year. Adjusting out the reserve financing impact, the current quarter's earnings grew by 5% relative to the second quarter of 2011.","Interest spreads were relatively flat for the first quarter as incremental relief on credited rates offset a small decline in yield. Looking forward, I'd expect to see 10 to 15 basis points of spread compression per year in today's rate environment.","The Group Protection had a very good quarter, reporting income from operations of $27 million or $24 million normalized. Net earned premium benefited from several quarters of strong sales and was up 8%. Non-medical loss ratio of 72.7% returned to the midpoint of our expected range, with all product lines experiencing a good quarter. LTD incidents and severity continued to perform within our expectations, and life mortality returned to a more normal level when compared to the first quarter. Our discount rate for new LTD claims remained at 4.25% during the quarter. I'd note that we lowered our rate to 4.25% back in the second quarter of 2011. This early movement on the discount rate should allow us to maintain this rate for the remainder of 2012. Today's rate environment would likely lead us to lower our discount rate 25 to 50 basis points in 2013, and we are taking this into consideration on the pricing of new and renewal business.","Turning to the balance sheet and capital management. Life company capital remained level during the quarter at 7.6 billion, and RBC came in at approximately 500%. Cash at the holding company was just north of $800 million, including $300 million of debt proceeds that we will use in August to fund the debt maturity. We repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total cost of $150 million, bringing the year-to-date total to $300 million. As I noted during the first quarter call, I expect to exceed initial guidance for the year for $400 million of capital deployment. Given our belief that our share price remains significantly undervalued, we have a bias to skew capital deployment toward share buybacks. But we'd note that we will also can continue to take leverage over the organization when the opportunity arises.","Let me wrap up what was a great quarter by noting that last week, Moody's affirmed our ratings and positive outlook, another indicator of both our positive past performance and the strength of our franchise as we move forward.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","So touching on the updated rate exposure, so the numbers you gave relate to, I think, GAAP earnings or kind of earnings overall. Is there any update to the disclosures you had given before about how DAC may be affected by a lower rate environment?","Randal J. Freitag","Note that DAC, which I think you're probably referring to the long-term earned rate assumption.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","That is exactly what I'm referring to, yes, the 4.25 versus the 6.25.","Randal J. Freitag","Right. Randy, that will be part of our third quarter unlocking process. I'm not going to front run that process. There's teams of people across the company working on that right now. Obviously, rates have come down, and so we'll take all of that information into account when we think about that long-term assumption. I would note, though, having been through more unlocking processes than I care to admit in my life, there are always pieces of the unlocking that go both ways. We will have positive impacts, and we will have negative impact. I don't know what the different -- the individual pieces are. We will do a thorough job of reviewing all of them and report the results through the third quarter.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just on one other piece of disclosure. I think this goes back to the investor event in November. There's kind of a base case and a low rate case scenario for cash flow adequacy, the $6 billion and $8 billion redundancy disclosure that you gave. Would that be affected by this new disclosure as well?","Randal J. Freitag","Right. I didn't go to that piece of the disclosure. What I did say is that my previous guidance for no near to midterm impact on statutory capital is unchanged. When you go out into that second half of a 10-year period on a piece of our business, the SGUL business, we projected there could be up to a $500 million impact. That guidance is completely unchanged from where we were before by the level of interest rates today.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All right. So, okay. So we should improve from that? Then the 6 to 8 would be kind of roughly intact still?","Randal J. Freitag","I think you can make that inference.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just had a question on your plans for excess capital beyond the buybacks. I think in the past, Dennis, you'd talked about potentially looking at deals. You've highlighted the Group Benefits space and also the pension market. If you're still doing that, and what do you see as activity in the market? And then secondly, you reported very strong growth in your Group Benefits business in terms of sales. What's certainly driving that? And what are you seeing terms of pricing in the Groups Benefits market?","Dennis R. Glass","Jimmy, on the M&A front, we continue to be interested in deploying some of our capital towards strategic opportunities, particularly related -- particularly in the Group and Retirement businesses. And that's unchanged. We'd probably, today, with where our share price is, not make such a large investment that it would stop us from buying our shares buyback -- shares back, so we continue to look at this on a holistic basis and take into consideration everything that you should when looking at building the company strategically and appropriately managing to your best return opportunities. With respect to the Group Protection business, let me start by saying unlike some of our competitors, we have a sweet spot in the small employer market. It's not without competition, but it's not as competitive, our belief, the jumbo market is, so a little bit less price pressure there. As I said in my remarks, strong sales relates primarily back to an increase in sale representatives, some 15% or 17%, and an increase in shelf space, if you will, because we have 20% more brokers who've never used us before selling the product. But let me give you one more statistic because there's a lot of discussion in the industry around pricing. I think we have continued to move prices up modestly where we can both on new business and renewals. And the metric that I pay very close attention to, one of many, in terms of trying to judge how competitive we are is our close rate because we close, we bid on large numbers of cases through the course of the year. And that close ratio, the number of cases that we actually win, stays -- had stayed pretty consistently in the 10% area. So I hope those are responsive to your 2 questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess I'm a little tired from the earnings late last night and the calls today. Can you just go over again, Randy, the changes in the underlying assumptions around the interest rate guidance that goes from 300 to, I think, 225, you said, I think the primary driver was that you've made some investments at a better return than you originally projected or something along those lines. Can you just kind of go over that again just so it's clear because I think that's a pretty important point?","Randal J. Freitag","Sure, Suneet. I mean, the primary change going forward is today's interest rate environment, right? So the last guidance was with a 10-year treasury of 2%. Today's guidance, looking forward, is for today's interest rate environment, where the 10-year treasury is bouncing between 140 and 150. In terms of what's impacted the results, what's made them better than before is the actions that we've taken as you look back, primarily better action on crediting rates than we originally projected, better results in the investment portfolio than we originally thought we'd get, and the actions we've taken on new business pricing. Now in the near term, it's the first 2 items that are the primary contributors there, but when you look forward, that changes from 10-year treasury of 2% to today's interest rate environment.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess why is that crediting rate better than you expected? Because I mean, I was always under the assumption that you have the flexibility to go to the floors. And so why would that be better than you expected?","Dennis R. Glass","If this gets in -- I'm going to take this question, Suneet. When we provided these projections, the questions that we were getting was not what are you going to do to change the life path? The questions were, what if you essentially did nothing, what would happen to your margins? And so when we provided the projections, we knew that we were going to be able to take some actions to mitigate that. I'm quite sure we said it. And so that's the reason -- that's an answer to your question. Let me go on to say that the second set of projections that we just provided are on that same basis, which is essentially everything else being equal and the only variable that changed would be the 50 basis points or so roughly decline in yields, that would be the consequence. But as Randy and I have both said, management is not going to accept that. We're going to take actions on core expenses. We're taking actions to improve our investment yield. We're again repricing new business. So I fully expect that like the 300 came down, now the 225 will come down. Now clearly, because much of the drift from 300 to 225 was related to crediting rates, you can see that quite clearly or some increase in investment yield. We're having a look elsewhere now that we've got floors on these crediting rates. But we're still adding a little bit of risk on the investment portfolio, which we'll pass through that incremental gain, we'll pass through to our shareholders, not to the products. Our core expense line, pretty good at managing expenses, but the environment is such that you have to get better. So the mitigation to the $225 million will occur elsewhere in the balance sheet, and I believe a lower overall net income number than you'll see it in the actual interest margin.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess, my second question, for Randy, you sort of teased us again like you did last quarter in terms of the amount of capital that you'd be willing to return in excess of the 400. Can you help us out a little bit of order of magnitude? I mean, all of the data points you're pointing to in terms of RBC, in terms of hedge programs, in terms of balance sheet, just continue so suggest that a lot of these risks are certainly manageable. So any incremental info or color on what the buybacks could be this year would obviously be helpful, too.","Randal J. Freitag","Let me -- I'll answer your question, but let me broaden it out a little bit, too. Let's look back first. We've done a significant amount of share repurchases over the last several quarters, $900 million. That represents roughly 12% of the shares we had outstanding at the beginning of that period. Now what drove that $900 million was both the strong capital position that we had and the free cash flow that we generate on an ongoing basis. Now when you look forward and when I project forward at those level of share buybacks at the dividend pays that we have over the life of the company, I fully expect that my RBC trajectory would be down 15 to 20 points a year. What you've seen over the last few quarters especially is that we've had sort of discrete events that have benefited the required capital. For instance, last quarter, we had an upgrade on a big holding, pretty much took required capital and made a change in that neutral for the quarter. So we've had these discrete events. As we've talked about when you look forward and we think about adding a little more risk to the portfolio, I don't necessarily think that. So when I look forward, when we're using capital in the way we're using it, I fully expect to see sort of our RBC trend to go down as you move forward. And I think that's the appropriate way to manage the strong capital position that we have today. When you think about all of the constituencies, the environment that exists today, constituencies being shareholders, constituencies being rating agencies, et cetera, I think that's the appropriate way to manage the capital today. We're being as aggressive as we can. I fully expect to be in the market over the remainder of the year. I'm not going to give you a specific guidance on what that number will be, but we will be deploying capital. Given where our share price is today, we'll skew that deployment towards share buybacks. We're not coming out of the market. We're going to go above our original guidance for the year, $400 million, as a reminder, by $300 million through the first 2 quarters. But we're not going to look -- we're going to be out there in the market, being aggressive, recognizing our share prices today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Spehar from Bank of America.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First, Randy, a follow-up on your comment about the progression of RBC. Where in your plan, where would you have thought the RBC ratio would be today given the buyback that you've completed versus where it actually has turned out?","Randal J. Freitag","When I -- when we look out and when we project sort of the behaviors we've had, we'd expect to see 15 to 20 points of RBC decline a year. That's the average. I mean, it jumps up and down, but over a 3-year planning period. And that gives you roughly 50 points of decline. We started this period with roughly 500 points of RBC, so I'd expected us to be in that 480, 475 range right now. And we're at 500. And the reason we haven't gone down is because of some of these events primarily continually improvement in the risk profile of the general account.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up. Just to clarify on the room that you have on crediting rates. Did you -- did I hear you correctly that you still -- you say you still have good flexibility on the individual Annuity block? That it was the Retirement and Life that you're pretty much at minimums?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, absolutely, that's exactly right. The Annuity business, we have ample room to respond to the declining earned rates, so we don't see any pressure on the economics per interest spread in that business. Absolutely on the Retirement and the Life space, were pretty much out of room to recover rates further. As Dennis mentioned, we do have other areas of the company. We'll look at to manage the bottom line impact of spread compression. The investment portfolio, expense management, we're not done managing that potential impact.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The comments around the expense leverage and then the ability to take on more risk within the investment portfolio, can you kind of talk some about what those potential expense initiatives could be and then what specific asset classes you guys are seeing an opportunity to take on more risk?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Chris. Let me give you some specific examples, things that are in various stages of being in place, some of which are still under way. Let's go to the asset portfolio first. We have a very small allocation in the alternative space, roughly 1% of our general account. I think we can very easily take that up a bit and be well within the risk appetite. So we recently issued a $450 million mandate to a high-quality manager to go out and invest in alternatives, private equity, hedge funds, et cetera. Also in the asset side, we have a very favorable liquidity profile. We have the capacity to take on investments that are a little less liquid. So we recently issued a mandate for $500 million a year to private placements, private placements that we don't really have access to as our current private platform. Once again, we're looking at our capacity, and we're going out in finding the best manager out there to fill that need. That's just a couple examples on the asset side. On the expense side, I'm not going to get any more specific than Dennis has said. We're very good at managing expenses, and you can fully expect that we'll be looking at all areas of general expenses as we go forward.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then within the investment portfolio, by changing some of that asset mix, what type of capital absorption does that take you up in terms of the RBC?","Randal J. Freitag","I think it's embedded in those numbers that I gave you before. I don't feel that will have any different glide path than I talked to you about, sort of that 15 to 20 points a year of decline in RBC.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then back in the November investor, you guys gave an update sort of under a moderate and severe stress scenario. And the biggest delta was the investment portfolio. And I guess given your comments today around the investment portfolio continuing to be better than expected, what type of incremental capital are you guys picking up just based on the better performance within the investment portfolio?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. I don't have the specific numbers on me today, Chris. And we haven't gone through the process in a couple of quarters, sort of that complete stress. But we'll do that again. I feel very good that when we go through that process, the results will be better or worse, the same as they were before. I feel very good about the things that have happened besides the general account and the position that's put us in today.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, just quickly on -- can you give us an update on where you guys stand within the DAC quarter?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, sure, Chris. We're well above the mean, a couple hundred million dollars if we unlock down to the mean. I believe if you look at the actual projection going forward, I think first year has roughly a 9% drop in sort of that the way we project out. So we have a lot of cushion. It represents roughly a couple of hundred million dollars if we were to unlock back to that mean.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the rates on the incremental or on the new sensitivity on the rates, Randy. Maybe this is tough to provide, but I was wondering whether you could help us understand just how much these management actions have impacted the outlook? I think in past conversations with you, it sounds like incremental move downward in rates is a linear sort of earnings drag. So under that assumption with none of the management actions, I would've assumed that, that $300 million of pressure at 2% would've gone up. I'm not sure exactly by how much, but it would've gone up. So I'm trying to get a better sense of trying to measure exactly how much the management actions brought that down. It seems to me that the net impact of the management actions could be easily $200 million.","Dennis R. Glass","Well, John, mathematically over the 3-year period, right, those management actions represented $75 million. Now...","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just mean versus where you would've been if we assumed the 140 -- the 1.4%, 1.5% 10-year.","Randal J. Freitag","Right. The -- John, let me go about your question on this way. The things we've done in the past have improved the results over that 3-year period by $75 million. Obviously, that's a number that continues projecting out into the future, so that has a present value much bigger than that. Going forward, we have over that 3-year period a total impact of $225 million. Not ready to talk to you specifically about what we believe we can offset against that, but the items we talked about, we believe we can really chew into that number in a serious way. Now when you look forward, the impact continues to remain linear in nature, at least over this next 3-year period and even beyond that. The impacts remain spread compression and reduction in your earned rate on surplus. Those are very linear impacts when you look forward. So I wouldn't expect the impact to have big jumps or dips in it as you move forward.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just turning specifically to Group Protection. I just hope that you could remind us how to think about a 25 or 50-basis-point discount rate cut. What kind of sense -- all by itself, what kind of an impact that might have on earnings? And then what does that translate into, all else equal, in terms of your pricing? You were talking about that as potentially a 2013 event. But if you've got a lot of new and renewal business coming up between now and, let's say, the beginning of the year, if you put in to price -- I'm just trying to get a sense of how much have to raise prices to essentially offset most of that discount rate cut.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. we'll, let's talk about the numbers. So a 25--basis-point reduction in discount rates translates into $2 million to $3 million of annual income, okay? It also translates into roughly 2% to 3% on premium, somewhere in that range. It's very hard to estimate. It's going to vary case to case to case. But let's call it that range. We are taking that sort of impact into account when we price cases today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Randy, I want to start and I want to go again to the guidance of $50 million, $100 million and $150 million, the $10 million, $75 million, $140 million, and maybe you can help me with some math here. Prior -- so last year, you were looking at a $50 million linear increase. Now, we're looking at a $65 million linear increase. Why does that go up? What's the math?","Randal J. Freitag","Well because you have a little more incremental year-by-year spread compression, right? I mean, rates are a little lower, so if we got spread compression of X before, there's annual spread compression of X plus something today, which translates into a $65 million annual growth in that number versus the $50 million we had before. So it's nothing more than that. Also, the impact of surplus is a little bigger but a little lower earned rate.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So basically you're saying, look, the changes that we made took us 50 down to 10, and then we go on with our lives. Is that probably the best way to look at it?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, we go along with our lives, and we are very active on managing other pieces of the income statement to mitigate as much of this impact as possible.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, that's right. If you lower your crediting rate on your liabilities, let's just use an example, not a specific example, but if we lowered our crediting rates on all of our liabilities by $50 million this year, that would repeat next year and the year after that, and year after, year after that. Is that the question?","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I think Randy got to it, Dennis. Can we look at -- you made a statement about, it sounded to me like you're saying if rates continue where they are, we could be looking at more price increases on the Life Insurance side from around year end. If that's an accurate interpretation of what you were saying, any sense of what you could be looking at?","Randal J. Freitag","I think the best thing to say is that we have, as you all know and we've said several times, we have kept up with what's been a pretty quick decline in interest rates over the last 18 months and we've made pricing changes which will balance our need to get very good ROEs on new business and for taking the franchise. So in the broadest sense, we continue to make it in all of our portfolios if pricing changes reflecting conditions in the marketplace. Back specifically to the Life Insurance business for a minute, I would again repeat what we've been saying is that we're moving away from SGUL into products that already have the turns that are at our targets. SGUL is already down to only 30% of our sales, and SGUL is the product that's most sensitive to interest rates. So there'd be a combination of pricing changes as needed along with this continued pivot to products that are less affected by the movement in interest rates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And one more, Dennis. Could you give us an update where the industry is, where NEIC is right now on PBR?","Dennis R. Glass","PBR and AG 38 are I think at the moment kind of in the same bucket. AG 38 and PBR are going to -- the process is coming to a close. And by the way, I would say that in my experience, the regulators in the industry have been working as well together on this as they could have. And no one's ceding, by the way, their own responsibilities at all, just the dialogue. So on AG 38 specifically, and large parts of principle-based reserving, the process is nearing its end. There's still moving parts, but we should have some specific knowledge in the next couple of weeks or so.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you're saying this summer, at the summer meeting, maybe actually the summer meeting?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A quick question for Randy. So you roll forward a little bit further in time. Rates are lower but actually, the outlook gets slightly better due to interest rates and related pressure. Is that -- should we take that to mean that as we look to 3Q or 4Q considering balance sheet type reviews in terms of goodwill, reserves, DAC, VOBA what -- anything else you might think to add in there, that you would also in -- I don't know if I would say better shape, but will that give you some cushion as you roll into sort of the testing season to think about how things might pan out?","Randal J. Freitag","I talked about the unlocking process a little bit ago, right. I'm not going to get in front of that. We are definitely going to look at both the long-term interest rate assumptions along with all the other assumptions that go with this process. I fully expect that there will be pluses and minuses. I don't know what the answer is at this point in time, but my experience tells me that there will pluses. There will be assumptions where we've been better than pricing. There will be assumptions where we've done worse than the pricing. And we'll see what the subtotal of it is. As it relates to the goodwill analysis, I'll just to remind everybody. I started out with the same comment. I'm not going to front run our process that occurs in the last half of the year. But I'll remind everybody, we took a good hard run at the key components of this last year, the profitability of new business, the amount of new business and the discount rate we applied for the goodwill analysis. Now we'll go through that same analysis this year, but I feel good about what we did last year.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. I guess another way to ask it would be if things are panning out better than your stress test, are things also panning out better than your embedded accounting assumptions? When I think -- because obviously, the accounting assumptions are best estimates, and stress test are something worse than that. But I guess I just want to try and get a sense for -- are the 2 related or should I think of them as completely unrelated? Because one was take -- starting from a much more conservative place.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Tom, I'm going to go back my early assumptions. You're talking about GAAP accounting?","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Right.","Randal J. Freitag","Well, best estimate sort of assumptions. There are some of those assumptions that I think we're doing better at. For instance, mortality. In general, when I -- hear for my businesses and when we report it to, we generally do better than pricing. Do I know exactly how that will translate in the amount? No. But generally we've done been better in that assumption relative to pricing. Interest rates, we've obviously been a little lower than the pricing assumption, and we look at that assumption. There will be some more we do better. There will be some more we do worse. It's always that way whenever you go through one of these unlocking processes. I don't know what the answer will be in the third quarter. I feel good about where we are, and I feel good coming into the process.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Randy, what's your outlook for AXXX reserve solutions in the back half of the year? I think my understanding is that the supply is pretty strong and the price is pretty good right now. So is there any reason to think you wouldn't be able to complete something in the back of the year?","Randal J. Freitag","We did a number of transactions last year. I've talked about that, and all that impacts growth in the earnings. You see it in the Life -- here in the Life business. And you've seen it reflected in some of the share buyback activity we've had. So I'm not giving point of guidance at what we're going to do over the remainder of the year. We obviously look at these things regularly to see if we have both capacity and the ability to do more of those. You are right. The marketplace is open. So there is capacity. It's at a reasonable price. I don't know if we'll complete any this year. Remember that we did 3 of these transactions last year. We'll see. We'll do our best, but I'm not giving any point of guidance yet.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the interest rate discussion. The 1.5% or 1.4% to 1.5% scenario, what does that correspond to for new money rates?","Randal J. Freitag","We would -- it varies by business, right? We would use as part of that process in more of a long-term average credit spread than, for instance, the credit spread that we experienced in the first half of the year. So if those treasury rates were more of a long-term look at what credit spreads typically are, it varies by business. It's going to be a little higher for a business like long-term Universal Life or the investment strategy is more of a 30-year strategy than it would be for the Annuity business. So it varies.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. And then last one on SGUL, have you guys seen any changes in lapse rates to this point in the low interest rate environment?","Randal J. Freitag","No, we haven't actually. We've seen lapses in that business run a little above what we've priced for. Frankly, we've said that in the past. So we haven't seen an explicit response to rates being low.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Smith from Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","My questions have all been answered.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein from Evercore Partners.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Actually, just a follow-up to Ryan's question. What would be the impact of profitability if you did see a decline in the lapse rate? I think you gave some information at your Investor Day where you did see some declines in both SGUL and the non-SGUL books. I'm just curious if you had, say, 100 or 150 basis points change in the lapse rate, how would that impact profitability?","Randal J. Freitag","Mark, I don't have updated guidance relative to what you've seen before. We feel really good about both the lapse assumption that's in our current models and the lapse assumption we're actually experiencing.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just thinking about rates on the VA business, I guess the first question is, are you fully hedging the product right now? Or are you taking any kind of rate that's currently? And then secondly, do you need to kind of make any further adjustments to the product given where we are today?","Randal J. Freitag","Mark, let me take the first half of that. We -- it is a hedging program, so we continue to hedge the liability as we calculate it. So I'm not taking any explicit bet with the hedge program right now. Let me turn the second part of the question over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Mark, we did -- as you know, we've moved to these Protected Funds, and the ROE on that business is pretty good because of the change in our hedge cost. We're seeing increasingly more of that selection being made so that's a good direction. Another action that we took was on the non-protected fund asset mix and the sub-accounts. We lowered the rates 50 basis points, the guarantee rate, the long-term guarantee rate, roughly 50 basis points. Back to my earlier comment, we have a like-for-like focus on getting the appropriate return on our capital. A lot of moving parts both in the economy and the capital markets, and as those become entrenched for any long period of time, we'll make the appropriate adjustments.","Operator","I show no further questions at this time and would like to turn the conference back to the speakers for closing remarks.","Jim Sjoreen","Well, we want to thank you all for joining us this afternoon.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher Giovanni","Thank you, Karen. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources, are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in this call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","So presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and CEO; and Randy Freitag, CFO. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","And with that, I'd like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results capped another very good year for Lincoln. Operating EPS was up nearly 20% for the full year, which enabled our operating return on equity to exceed 13%, a 100 basis point increase over the prior year. The ROE expansion is impressive considering book value per share, excluding AOIC, also grew 9%. The majority of our business segments are performing well. The 1 area where remain disappointed is Group Protection earnings, but we are taking the necessary actions to restore profitability.","We recognize low interest rates remain topical, given further declines in long-term rates, and Randy will discuss this later. However, we remain confident that we have the internal levers and inherent product demand that will enable our positive momentum to continue even if low interest rates persist.","Specific to the fourth quarter, results included a bit more noise than prior periods. That said, our actions were opportunistic and resulted in more favorable earnings and positioned us to deploy additional capital in 2015. Importantly, our strategic initiatives, risk management rigor and the way we approach the marketplace and key constituents is unchanged. Bottom line, we remain a very clean story as we enter 2015, and we'll leverage our strengths to advance Lincoln even further.","Notable among them are consistent presence in key markets. This affords us the opportunity to expand distribution partners and methodically grow sales in higher growth markets at attractive returns.","Robust capital management. Buybacks totaled $650 million for the full year, a 44% increase over the prior year. Our active capital management strategy also included a 25% increase in our common stock dividend.","Broad balance sheet and risk management strength. This was once again exhibited as we completed our annual goodwill and statutory cash flow testing with no material impact from either review. Lincoln is well positioned with a healthy RBC ratio, a high-quality and diversified investment portfolio, ample liquidity and robust risk management programs.","Turning to the business lines. Individual Life had another solid year, particularly coming off very strong sales in 2013 and further product introductions. Individual Life sales increased 5% for the full year and were flat in the fourth quarter. Our diversified sales mix remains a hallmark of Lincoln and is driven by a broad product portfolio and disciplined risk management as no single product represented more than 25% of our total production this quarter.","Indexed Universal Life and Variable Universal Life sales continue to show good momentum as IUL posted a record sales quarter. We're encouraged that our new MoneyGuard product continues to gain traction as sales increased sequentially throughout 2014 and totaled $47 million in the fourth quarter. We expect this momentum to continue in 2015 as the product gets approved in a few more key states. It is worth a reminder that our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably. It is grounded in our goal to price our entire Life portfolio to achieve 12% to 15% returns.","Looking forward, Life is well positioned for sales growth, given the depth and breadth of our distribution relationships and product diversity. Equally important, we have a proven ability to capture new market opportunities and adapt to changing macroeconomic and regulatory conditions.","Before I shift to Individual Annuities, I briefly want to mention that in December we entered into an agreement with a key reinsurer partner. The agreement allows us to opportunistically recapture several life insurance treaties. Randy will provide more details, but we view the transaction very favorably given the positive economic benefits.","In the Individual Annuity business. Positive operating leverage continued in the fourth quarter, which led to another outstanding quarter. Looking at the full year, disciplined pricing contributed to steady earnings growth and strong returns, and our comprehensive annual review validated policyholder behavior assumptions. Our stable market presence once again resulted in over $3.3 billion of deposits in the fourth quarter and more than $0.5 billion of positive net flows. For the full year, total deposits of about $14 billion led to positive net flows of $2.6 billion. Lincoln's consistent approach to the annuity market, combined with product introductions designed to meet consumer needs, has resulted in $16 billion of positive net flows over the past 5 years, all on our terms.","One of the most recent product introductions was Investor Advantage, our investment-focused product. We continue to gain significant traction, with fourth quarter sales up 74% from our very successful launch in the third quarter. This has further accelerated a key strategic initiative, which is to push our variable annuity sales mix to 30% nonliving benefit and 70% living benefit. In the fourth quarter, this still continued as nonliving benefit sales were 26% of total VA sales, up from 18% in the prior year quarter. Including the impact on sales covered by our reinsurance treaty, nonguaranteed products comprised 58% of total VA sales in the quarter.","We remain optimistic and are confident we are positioned for growth in the Annuity business. Demographic tailwinds still support product demand, while the reemergence of several key competitors and continued macro uncertainty further validate the need for our diverse annuity product portfolio. Our disciplined approach to risk management, combined with product innovation, will enable us to write attractive new business to add to our existing block of high-quality business.","Turning to Group Protection. Weak earnings in the fourth quarter and throughout 2014 were primarily the result of poor long-term disability loss ratios. As I have discussed in the past, to improve profitability we are taking aggressive pricing actions, primarily aimed at our employee-paid -- employer-paid businesses. We also think most of the recent earnings pressure and volatility is related to our move to a new claim system in July and associated process changes. As a result, we see an opportunity to improve profitability as we refine the integration. While I'm disappointed we did not show another quarter of sequential earnings improvement, it is important to remember that our earnings recovery will not be linear and when margins are this low does not take much for earnings to bounce around quarter-to-quarter.","Fourth quarter sales of $250 million were down 7% for the same period last year, and full-year sales were down 11%. As a result of our pricing actions, the employer-paid portion of our sales were down more meaningfully, 18% in the fourth quarter and 19% for the full year. Higher-margin employee-paid product sales were up 5% in the fourth quarter and represented 54% of quarterly sales compared to 48% in the prior year quarter. Looking forward, we'd expect sales growth to remain pressured as we take the necessary steps to return Group Protection margins over time to our 5% to 7% after-tax margin target.","Turning to Retirement Plan Services. The earnings profile remains steady throughout 2014. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 42% from a year ago. Full-year's results were a very good story, with total deposits up 11% to a record $7.5 billion, with strength in both the small and mid-to-large markets. Recurring deposits contributed $4.8 billion in 2014, up 7%. Favorable equity market performance resulted in a sequential increase in account values, which now stand at just under $54 billion, a 4% increase from a year ago.","Lumpiness in net flows is being driven by the natural ebb and flow in the mid-to-large case market. This quarter deposits benefited from one large case. But the large case termination we referenced on our third quarter conference call led to negative flows of around $900 million in the quarter and $880 million for the full year. We remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our Retirement business. Our core products are poised to grow faster than the industry, while continued expansion into segments like the government and small market bode well for Lincoln. In fact, we are seeing several notable wins as we start the year, and the pipeline looks strong. Based on current visibility, which goes out about a half a year, we expect to see positive net flows in the first half of the year.","Turning to Distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and work site teams remain a competitive advantage for Lincoln. Each channel continues to deliver outstanding results and create financial and strategic flexibility by properly balancing growth, product diversification and profitability.","Lincoln's producer base stands at over 63,000 strong. We've continued to gain traction on producer productivity, with 1\/4 of our fixed annuities and 1\/3 of both RPS and MoneyGuard sales coming from our cross-sell strategies.","Client-facing distribution headcount increased 6% at both LFD and across LFG. Importantly, headcount grew even faster in key growth areas. Notably, small-market RPS was up 29%, and Individual Life increased 10%.","At LFN, our nearly 8,500 affiliated advisers is unchanged year-over-year. However, our registered reps are up 2% due to investments in our broker-dealer clearing platform and recruiting. Looking ahead, we'll continue to invest in Distribution as we seek to expand our extensive footprint to grow sales further in 2015.","And finally, in Investment Management. Our new money purchases of $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter were invested at an average yield of 4.3%, which was 210 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. This strong result was primarily attributable to investment-grade spread widening where underlying credit fundamentals remain strong.","As we discussed at our recent Investor Day conference, we continue to utilize our yield-enhancing debt program, which added 22 basis points to our new money yield this quarter. The majority of our yield-enhancing debt purchases were in investment-grade assets, which actually helped reduce our overall portfolios below investment-grade exposure from the prior year quarter.","Our business model is supporting our yield-enhancing debt program. Our retail-focused product mix results in long-duration liabilities with predictable payment patterns. This enables us to invest in less liquid assets, an area where we have found incremental value and have additional capacity. With recent volatility in the energy market, it is worth noting that our energy exposure is consistent with our broader portfolio, high quality and diversified; 95% of our energy holdings are investment grade, with diversification across subsectors and issuers. In fact, our primary fixed income energy exposure had a net unrealized gain of over $700 million or 8% of book value at the end of January, up from the year -- end of the year.","So in closing, Lincoln had a very good quarter. As I noted at our Investor Day, I don't recall a time where our relative strength and industry position has been this strong, which affords us the opportunity to grow and grow profitably. This should enable us to remain a steady EPS growth story.","With that, let me turn it over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $439 million or $1.67 per share for the fourth quarter, up 19% from the prior year. The quarter's excellent results capped off a strong year, which saw full year operating EPS increase 20% to $6.03, another record for Lincoln.","As noted in the press release, we had normalizing items of $53 million or $0.20 per share in the quarter, primarily related to the recapture of previously reinsured life insurance business. Excluding normalizing items, EPS increased 12% in the quarter and 18% for the full year.","Looking at key performance metrics. Top-line growth remains strong, even excluding the reinsurance recapture, with operating revenue up 6% for the quarter and 8% for the full year, driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year and the benefit of favorable equity markets. Continued focus on managing expenses created further margin expansion as the 5% growth in annual G&A, net of capitalized expenses, trailed revenue growth and improved our expense ratio by 40 basis points.","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $49.29. Operating return on equity came in at 13.1% for the full year. Excluding normalizing items, ROE was 12.3% in the quarter and 12.5% in 2014, an 80 basis point increase versus 2013.","The strength of our balance sheet is highlighted by record statutory capital of $8.8 billion and an RBC ratio of approximately 540%, which gives us significant financial flexibility.","A couple other items of note specific to the fourth quarter. G&A was above our normalized level due to seasonality we typically see during the fourth quarter along with higher incentive comp expenses. Higher G&A was offset by favorable tax true-ups and the prepayment-related investment income that came in above our expectations. As I noted in prior calls, that is expected in this environment.","Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by the agreement to sell our media business and modest breakage in the VA hedge program. Full-year net income was a strong story, with realized losses coming in at just $47 million for the year, while VA head results were very good, with just $4 million of variable annuity net derivative losses. This resulted in net income equaling 94% of operating income for the year.","Before shifting to segment highlights, I would like to comment on the persistently low interest rate environment. At our November Investor Day, we noted that interest rates remain just an earnings headwind, and we reiterate that view today, even as rates have moved lower.","A couple of points. Our 2014 year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy. In fact, we have seen our reserve sufficiency increase from 2013 in both our base case and stress scenarios. We showed at Investor Day that spread compression is abating, even if we assumed rates remain flat at current levels. Recall that we estimated flat rates with depressed EPS growth by 2% to 3% versus 4% to 5% in prior years but still enable us to achieve our targeted EPS growth rate of 8% to 10%. Given the decline in interest rates since our November Investor Day, we estimate we are likely to be at the top end of this 2% to 3% range, but that capital management actions will provide a more favorable offset.","Now I will turn to segment results and start with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $237 million, a 19% increase over last year. Operating revenues increased to 9% from the fourth quarter of 2013 as positive net flows continued, and we benefited from further tailwinds in equity markets, which combined drove an 8% increase in average account values that reached $122 billion at year end.","Returns in the Annuity business continued to be very strong and highlight the quality of our Annuity book. ROI once again increased sequentially, and ROE came in at 25% for the quarter and 26% for the year. With record assets, earnings and returns, it was another outstanding year for the Annuity business.","As we enter 2015, our strong market position, success with our relatively new investment-focused product, our hedge program and recent product refinements should support further profitable growth in deposits and net flows.","In Retirement Plan Services, we recorded earnings of $42 million. Fourth quarter revenue growth was up 2% year-over-year and sequentially, consistent with our annual revenue growth. Account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 4% versus the prior year, as positive fund performance was partially offset by the net outflows that Dennis mentioned earlier. The impact on interest margins from low rates has been most pronounced in RPS. Normalized spreads compressed 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our prior guidance. And looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business.","Return on assets of 31 basis points for the fourth quarter and 30 basis points for the full year were both at the top end of our long-term targeted range of 25 to 30 basis points. While in total across the company the net impact of G&A prepayment income and taxes was 0, the RPS segment did benefit from the sum total of those items by approximately $5 million.","Pretax net margin increased 250 basis points in 2014 to 34.1%. Overall, 2014 was a good year for the Retirement business, despite consistent declines in interest rates. Revenue growth outpaced expense growth, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings and a 16.4% return on equity.","The Life Insurance segment reported fourth quarter earnings of $193 million or $140 million after normalizing items, primarily related to the recapture of life insurance treaties. Let me first speak to the recapture. We reached an agreement in December with a key reinsurance partner in which we recaptured business within our current retention limits related to several life insurance treaties. The recapture includes an established block of mortality risk written in the 1990s to early 2000s and increases our total face amount retained by 5%. As we have noted in the past, this is a period where reinsurers were particularly aggressive in their pricing assumptions. With this transaction, we capitalize on a mutually beneficial resolution with the reinsurer in which they paid us $500 million to recapture the business.","A few key points about the transaction. The mortality assumption that we employed in assessing the deal is based upon current assumptions that reflect actual experience on the business. Additionally, we employed an outside actuarial consultant with significant mortality expertise. The underlying experience on the recapture business is right in line with our current retained experience. This is a book of business where we were often paying out less in reinsurance premiums than we were receiving backing claims from the reinsurer. What we were able to do with this transaction is capitalize those future profits at a very attractive discount rate. After establishing reserves and paying taxes, we expect to take the $200 million of net proceeds and use it to fund incremental share repurchases. When combined with the earnings impact of the recaptured business, we expect the transaction to be accretive to annual EPS.","Turning back to underlying results in our Life business. Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 6% to 7%, and Life Insurance in force up 4%. Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were flat quarter-over-quarter and down 11 basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis in the Life business, consistent with comments at our Investor Day. Overall, a solid year for our Life Insurance business, capped by a very favorable economic transaction that we expect to be accretive to annual EPS.","The Group Protection segment results continue to fall short of expectations as we reported a loss from operations of $7 million in the fourth quarter compared to a gain of $11 million in the prior year. Earnings remained negatively impacted by poor results in the LTD business, driven by higher-than-expected incidence and lower-than-expected recoveries. Let me put some numbers around those 2 items. We typically do see higher incidence rates in the fourth quarter. Over the fourth quarter 2014, incidence rate was 10% higher than the prior year. Incidences more in line with historical seasonality patterns but have improved results by approximately $8 million for the quarter.","Claim recoveries were down significantly in the fourth quarter, coming in about 20% below our expectations based on historical levels. Although some movement in this number can be expected, that sort of deviation is definitely out of the norm. I'd estimate that the lower recoveries negatively impacted the quarter by $9 million.","Given our analysis of the higher incidence rates and lower recoveries, we believe the introduction of our new claims management system and its associated process changes explain most of the deterioration and increased volatility we have seen over the last 3 quarters. As we better integrate the new claims system into our operation, we believe that we will see improved claim management effectiveness and, thus, improved morbidity and profitability.","Looking forward, our outlook for the group business is consistent with prior comments, including those from our November Investor Day. Notably, we expect earnings to improve, but the improvement will not be linear. The realization of benefits from our new claims system and continued focus on strengthening the group leadership team, combined with significant price increases, will be positive levers to Lincoln's long-term earnings growth and enable us to ultimately achieve our margin targets.","Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. 2014 was another great year from a capital generation and deployment standpoint. Strong statutory performance with operating earnings of $1.4 billion allowed us to upstream nearly $1 billion to the holding company, which led us to deploy over $800 million in 2014, up 42%. This included $650 million in share buybacks and $168 million in shareholder dividends. Holding company cash ended the year at $554 million. Statutory surplus grew by $800 million to a record level of $8.8 billion. And as noted earlier, we estimate our RBC ratio will end the year at approximately 540%. The increases are driven by the strong statutory earnings combined with the reinsurance recapture and other tactical activities in the fourth quarter.","As you may be aware, we have $250 million of debt due in June. We are comfortable with our current leverage and capital structure and do not see a need to delever further.","Finally, let me comment on capital deployment expectations for 2015. Given the strength of the balance sheet and strong capital generation trends, I would expect share buybacks to exceed the $650 million we put to work in 2014. We continue to view buybacks as an excellent use of capital but anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend as well. Bottom line, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","I'm just wondering if you could quantify the incremental amount of premium that will be coming back with the treaty recapture.","Randal J. Freitag","The 2 items, as I mentioned, on this book of business is that historically and oftentimes we had been receiving back more in claims than we were paying out in premiums. The approximate premium number that we are paying out on an annual basis was roughly $150 million.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Okay. And are there opportunities for more treaty recaptures out there with other counterparties?","Randal J. Freitag","I don't think of these as opportunities. We're in constant negotiations with our reinsurers over any number of items. So I wouldn't say that there are opportunities as much as these things come up from time to time.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Great. And then one about the investment portfolio. You screen on the high side with exposure to energy. Can you give us any updates on your exposure to energy, the sector, both investment grade and below investment grade?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. We have about $9.5 billion in energy exposure. And that's very diversified, as I mentioned. So by category, in the independent category, maybe 29%; midstream, 28%; oilfield services, 21%; integrated energy companies, 19%; refining, 2%. So you can see it's very diversified by the type of energy company. Specifically, to answer your question, 95% of our exposure or $9 billion of the $9.5 billion is in investment grade. $0.5 billion is in below investment grade. We have spent the last 2 to 3 weeks -- well, actually, the last couple of months, going company by company at the $50 oil price. And we don't see significant credit issues at $50. And so we're quite comfortable with the overall energy portfolio.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I'm going to try and ask you a question around the group segment, and appreciate the data you gave there about being below planned. But I guess I'm trying to understand a little bit better how the implementation of the new claims systems, and I assume more staff, hurt results, if I heard that correctly, or maybe hindered processes. If you could walk us through that more, I'd be interested. Obviously, and I don't think they would affect incidence, but maybe how that affected recoveries and other elements of the claims process. And also, how far through that process we are before those things stabilize?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Thanks for the question, Randy. I think anytime you make changes in the claims area you're going to see some dissonance. So specifically, we were introducing, making one of the largest changes, again, and we were introducing a whole new claims system. The whole process around doing something that means that you are going to be spending a lot of time -- or your claims examiners are going to be spending a lot of time on training. They're going to be spending -- that's both before the introduction of the system and after. They're going to be spending time on understanding new processes that come with the new system. They're going to be spending time understanding the new technology overall that they have in place. So what happens is that your claims examiners need to spend more time doing those things. And what happens as a result is that caseloads tend to tick up a little bit around the introduction of something like this. There's a direct link between increased caseloads and increased loss ratios. And that's what we've seen. I think that we could've done a better job of managing the whole process around the introduction of the claims system, and that's partly why we've seen some changes in management in the group business. But it's that whole process that involves -- that is involved with introducing a new claims system, the training, the processes, everything, that causes caseloads to tick up, which causes loss ratios to go up. We're in the process of -- training should be ramping down. The claims examiners should be fully trained on the new system. We'll get the processes straightened out. So I don't think this is a very long-term item. But it's going to take us a little bit, and you'll see a little more volatility along the way.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So you're about a year into the launch of the new claims system, and are you -- have you staffed up to keep the caseload more manageable for the adjusters?","Randal J. Freitag","I think part of the fix is making sure that you're staffing up to appropriate level to handle any near-term volatility. And we're doing some of that.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And is it year -- Randy, at the year end, is that -- how far are we into this process?","Randal J. Freitag","Hard to give an exact measure. But we're -- I think we'll be fully done with all these things we need to do, the training, the process and everything in about roughly the middle of the year.","Dennis R. Glass","Let me comment one more time on my view on the group business. First start by saying, the market is in large part accepting our renewal increases. We're getting them on the business that we want to get them. We're driving away the more unprofitable businesses where we've been asking for higher rate. And I'm speaking specifically to the employer paid. So management is in control of turning this business around. There's nothing in the market that's going to stand in our way. And candidly, as Randy just mentioned, management in part made some missteps to put us in this position. But I'm confident that we're getting the price increases on our employer-paid business that we need. I'm confident that the work to be done around improving the claims management process will be done. And so I do see us getting back to our 5% to 7% margins in the 2015, 2016 time frame. And again, I'm going to reemphasize, I believe it's in management's control to get back to those numbers because the market is competitive, but pricing is pretty firm in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Randy, I wanted to circle back on the reinsurance recapture. The way you explained it I think clears things up for me. But I just want to make sure I got this. So essentially, what was the case was you had a, I would say, very favorable terms on terms of the treaties that you had, just in terms of the premiums that you were paying out versus the claims you were paying out. And so in order to unwind that favorable deal, you're getting paid a lot essentially. So what should happen here is your life earnings would go down. But then, said another way, you're giving up some of those earnings by getting the cash and the stock gain. But the buyback amount you're able to do with that incremental cash will more than offset the lost earnings in the life book. Is that -- am I understanding that correctly, just mechanically, the way this is going to work?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. That's a very good summary of the overall transaction, Tom. If you think about -- just a little more on this deal. If you go back to the '90s and early 2000s when we repriced this business, we expected to have reinsurance gains. It was part of the pricing process. At that time, as I mentioned, reinsurers were particularly aggressive, it seems, with their pricing assumptions that we -- that's what we anticipated. So the profits we were experiencing on the reinsurance are not surprising. And in fact, they were part of our pricing. But what we were able to do with this is look at that stream of expected reinsurance profits in the future, discount them at a very attractive rate, mid-single-digit sort of rate, and that represents the $200 million that I talked about. That's the statutory gain. Now separate from that, there's GAAP accounting. So we bring this book of business onto our GAAP balance sheet. We adjust our assumptions around cost of reinsurance, et cetera. And you saw -- so you see a slightly smaller gain on the GAAP side. As I mentioned, the life business benefited by roughly $53 million during the quarter, primarily related to this transaction, so lower than the $200 million. So you'll have some -- essentially, you've strengthened your GAAP balance sheet. So you have a smaller impact on the GAAP basis. So what I expect on the GAAP basis is a little more volatility, not a whole lot of volatility, because at the end of the day we didn't increase our retained amount by all that much. In fact, I think this deal took our average retained face amount from $175,000 to $185,000, so about a 5% increase. So I expect a little more volatility, not a huge amount of volatility. And I don't expect a material impact on the overall life insurance earnings at the end of the day. And as you said, we'll then take the $200 million, put it into incremental share buybacks. Net-net overall, I expect it to be accretive to EPS.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. So you wouldn't expect life earnings power to go down? You just expect a little more volatility around it?","Randal J. Freitag","When viewed on an annual basis, I mean, they may go down a little bit. But I don't expect a material impact. Remember that this is roughly a 5% increase in their retained face amount. So it's not a huge impact inside of what is a very large business. So there may be some small impact. But nothing that I would call material, none that would spike out.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And then just my last question. So I totally get why you're doing it. If -- the main question I'm getting is, it would seem to be not a great economic transaction for your counterparty. And is it fair to assume that they would have a difference of views in terms of how they would expect this book to develop than you? I assume that has to be the question unless there's something regulatory or otherwise that is causing them to enter into this transaction with you.","Randal J. Freitag","All's I can say, Tom, as I mentioned in my script, I think it was a mutually beneficial arrangement. I don't know how they would characterize it on their side other than I think the negotiations were amicable, and we reached a mutually beneficial resolution.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a question on interest rates. Randy, you said in your prepared remarks, much like at Investor Day that the current level of interest rates is not going to create a balance sheet issue; it's more of an earnings headwind. I guess the question is, at what rate level, whether current or forward curve, would we really start to see the balance sheet impact? Because it just seems like every time interest rates fall, you focus us on earnings, which I get. But there has to be at some point where the pressure builds and we start to see something in terms of the balance sheet.","Randal J. Freitag","As I mentioned in my script, I pointed out 2 specific items. First, I talked to our year-end reserve sufficiency emerging from the cash flow testing results, and that remains very strong. In fact, it increased over 2013. And I talked about the earnings headwind component. There are -- outside of that, you have some subset tests on the life insurance business that I think get pressured over time in a very low rate environment. But as I mentioned, that's over time. I think it's easily manageable given the overall size of our capital position and balance sheet. And separate from that, of course, we typically, in the third quarter, do an annual review of all of our assumptions. So we'll have to look at our long-term interest rate assumptions. And as I mentioned in the past, the impact of lowering our long-term rate assumption 50 basis points is a roughly $125 million. So we have those other things we have to think about. I don't think there's anything that I would consider to be dramatic out there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then there were some comments in the prepared remarks about goodwill testing, and, obviously, there was no impairment this time. Can you give any color, like you typically do in the K, around where there may have been some pressure in terms of goodwill and where we might have seen or may see some impairments down the road?","Randal J. Freitag","There -- and these will be similar comments that I've made every year at this time. There are 3 main drivers of goodwill. There's the amount of new business you're selling. In the life insurance business, we've seen our sales grow. In the group business, we continue to have very strong sales. There's the profitability of that new business you're selling. As Dennis mentioned, we're targeting 12% to 15% in the life insurance business. That's very strong profitability. And we're also looking at strong price increases on the group side. So we're looking at profitable new business that we're selling today. And the third item is the discount rate, what's the rate you're discounting those things. I don't think that rates on acquired life insurance business and group business have really ever been lower in the marketplace. So discount rates are very attractive. So all 3 items that are the main drivers of goodwill are in very good shape today. And so it didn't surprise me at all that when we went through the analysis there was no goodwill impairment.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Did any of the segments move to step 2 of your process?","Randal J. Freitag","I think typically a couple of the segments have moved to step 2 almost every single year. And I think that was the same.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Assuming it's life and group?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Randy, I wanted to focus on your comments on prepayments. And I understand that in this low rate environment they're going to remain elevated. If I look at your disclosures, I think prepayments range from a 30 to 35 basis point contribution of spread in this quarter, which is significantly higher than the 10 basis points of spread contribution from prepay if you look over the average of the last 3 years. I understand that this stays elevated. But this is a material delta. Can you give us a sense of how you think about prepays going forward relative to this quarter and relative to the average of the last 3 years?","Randal J. Freitag","As I mentioned, it was a strong quarter for prepays. Let me speak to the sum total of prepays and alternative investment incomes for the quarter, because alternative investment income was lower than we'd expected during the quarter. I mentioned 3 items in my script, not normalized items, but just 3 items that offset each other. I mentioned prepayment, the sum total of prepayment alternative investment income. I'd estimate that was roughly a $50 million benefit across all the businesses for the quarter. I also mentioned that we had some favorable tax items during the quarter. That was roughly $50 million across the -- across all the businesses. And then I mentioned that it was offset by G&A. And G&A was driven by higher incentive comp expenses in the quarter. We always have seasonality around projects getting done, those sorts of things, in the fourth quarter. So there were a number of items that drove G&A up to about $30 million after tax across the businesses, completely offsetting those 2 particular items. But focus in just on the investment income component, it was roughly $50 million across the businesses.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify that G&A. When you say $30 million higher, that is above and beyond the normal seasonality of the fourth quarter, is that correct?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. I think if you look at the G&A net of amounts capitalized in the fourth quarter and compare it to an average for the full year, you'd see what I'm talking about. Just on the pre-DAC basis, I think the fourth quarter is roughly $58 million higher than the average for the full year.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the prepays. And I understand the positive GAAP earnings element of prepays. But from an economic standpoint, why shouldn't we be thinking about these prepays as negative? Presumably, you need to reinvest these funds back into the portfolio. So wouldn't accelerated prepays lead to, ultimately, faster spread compression in the long term?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. And it's been embedded in our spread compression now for the 4 years you've talked about, especially in the last couple of years. So there isn't a change in the trajectory or spread compression because of prepays. It's just been in the results and in our guidance for some time now. All else being equal, I prefer that people didn't prepay. I mean, I would love the asset staying around. But we're dealing with it. It's in the spread compression, expectations that I'd given you for the 2 main impact of businesses, which is life and retirement.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just first want to ask a asset question to see if you could clarify the expected timing of the incremental buyback. Is this something we should expect to be sort of front-loaded given that you have the cash on hand now?","Randal J. Freitag","As I mentioned, we expect to exceed the $650 million we did in the -- in 2014. And I expect we'll go strong early in the year also.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And that -- exceeding that includes the benefit of the $200 million, correct?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just one question on retirement. Can you just talk about the dynamics you're seeing in the market right now around competition and declining activity levels?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. The marketplace is competitive. And I think I'll broadened the question to all of our products. We participate in competitive markets. Specifically in the group business, we haven't seen an uptick in competitiveness over the prior years. But it continues there continues to be a lot of good providers that we're competing with. We're seeing good results on our presentations and the number of presentations that we're winning. So I'd just characterize it as a competitive market. And across our businesses, we have to stay relevant. We have to focus on product distribution and technology to keep our competitive position solid, and we're doing that. So all businesses are competitive. We don't see any extremes in any of the 4 businesses. Again, I felt for the last couple of years that it's a pretty solid market, and in large part, the competition is sensible and reasonable. And we're competing just as we need to.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You spoke about like the changes in the claim management system for the disability business. Can you also discuss what you're doing on the pricing side and how much of the books been repriced? When do you expect that process to be completed?","Randal J. Freitag","In terms of how much has come through the pipeline and the repricing process, from a financial merger standpoint, it's roughly 30% as of the end of the year has come through in terms of the price increases.","Dennis R. Glass","Let me answer that. In 2014, again, we're talking about employer paid. We're driving mid- to single-digit increases at targets in aggregate. Renewal pricing in 2014, that's for new business, is up middle -- mid-single digits. But importantly, we are running off unprofitable business where we pushed for higher rate increases. As a result of continued pricing actions, fourth quarter persistency was down a little bit, not dramatically. So middle single-digit for the business that's staying, again, predominantly employer paid. And in the first quarter of 2015, we're going to drive that expectation a little bit higher, sort of asking for low double-digit increases. It's hard to predict what we will get. But these are solid increases on the business that's staying and the renewal, solid new business pricing. And as Randy said, it will continue to roll through the income stream.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then lastly, you've had some large lapses in the retirement business. Do you have any visibility into more lower potential large case of withdrawals or lapses as you -- over the next couple of quarters in Retirement?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. In aggregate, our visibility right now is the expectation that we have positive cash flow in the first half of 2015. And the goal further than that, we just don't have enough actual information to give you a thought on that or an estimation on that.","Operator","And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Quick follow-up on the reinsurance recapture. Was any of the cash received already deployed in 2014?","Randal J. Freitag","No. 2014 buybacks did not include any impact from the reinsurance recapture.","Dennis R. Glass","We're in closed period. We can't be buying until a couple of days after today's meeting.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then could you maybe add a little color as to how it is that the spread compression outlook from November hasn't -- sorry, let me start over. How is it that spread compression today -- of your outlook today hasn't really changed beyond the guidance levels offered in November given the fact that we have seen the 50 basis point decline since November? Are you able to offset the compression by additional enhancements? Or is there something else that's driving kind of your ability to keep within the range?","Randal J. Freitag","Yaron, I'd say, I think we have changed. Remember, at Investor Day, we provided a range of 2% to 3%. I think at the time we were at the low end of it, the very low end of that range. And as I mentioned in my script, I'd say, we're more at the upper end of that range right now but that, that increase in the impact of spread compression will be more than offset by the capital actions that we've talked about. So I think we are experiencing a little more spread compression. It's just not up to the level it was a couple of years ago.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So put differently, when you came up with the 2% to 3% range back in November, you already contemplated a scenario yields would be at this level?","Randal J. Freitag","No. As I mentioned, at the Investor Day we provided a range of 2% to 3%. And we were at the low end. In actuality with rates at that level, we were at the low end of that range. Rates are a little lower now. There's been some offset from spread widening, I would note. But overall, all-in new money yields are a little lower now. And that means that the compression impact has now moved to the upper end of that range, so from 2% to 3%.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

Please go ahead sir.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, operator. And good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, income from operations and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. ","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Lincoln had another very good quarter. You read it in the news release but it is worth repeating that we achieved record operating earnings per share of $1.56 as well as record revenues up 9%. These results are being driven in large part by strong sales, positive net flows, and market lift. Each business showed sequential earnings improvement in the third quarter, that being said our group protection business is still not where it should be but we continued to make progress particularly with pricing actions. ","When analyzing our strong performance, it is clear that our results tie to the demonstrated ability over time to deliver on our core strategies. Notable among them, maintaining a consistent presence in key markets which combined with distribution scale and a diversified product portfolio help us to grow sales where we want to grow them and on our terms. ","A laser focus on repricing products were necessary to achieve acceptable return on capital, actively managing capital as evidenced in the third quarter by repurchasing another $150 million of shares as well as the 25% increase in our common stock dividend. And finally sustaining our financial strength, which includes a healthy RBC ratio, high quality and diversified general account portfolio, and cash at the holding company. Further, our annual assumption review validated the DAC balances.","In the past few weeks equity markets and interest rates have experienced significant volatility. But we have a strong franchise and our job is to mitigate effects of capital market shifts, while at the same time growing earnings and ROE. We have a good record of responding to challenging conditions and our guidance on these issues as they affect Lincoln has been spot on. ","We will share more detail on our overall strategy at the next months Investor Meeting, for now let me turn to the business segments starting with individual life. Our individual life product sales were up from a year ago. This favorable result reflects strong index universal life and variable universal life sales. Growth was tempered somewhat by a 2% decline in MoneyGuard sales. The product actions we took earlier this year are gaining traction, which included updates to variable universal life, index universal life, and the launch of our MoneyGuard 2 product.","Total MoneyGuard sales reached $43 million in the quarter, their highest level of the year. The flex pay option which expanded our market reach by offering clients the opportunity to make periodic payments represented more than 40% of MoneyGuard sales. We continue to focus on selling a diversified set of product solutions which gives us the flexibility to meet evolving consumer preferences and make new business less concentrated and returns in total less sensitive to interest rate volatility. Our sales diversification coupled with returns on new business in the 12% to 15% range provides us with an impressive risk return position.","We are taking steps to expand and enhance our offerings, furthering our position as a leader in this space. We recently released our first ever survivorship indexed universal life and we will be implementing fourth quarter enhancements to our term products. Our profitable and broad portfolio solutions combined with the power of our distribution has us well positioned for the future.","Switching to our individual annuity business it was another quarter of great results. Total annuity sales of $3.5 billion drove positive net flows including $800 million from variable annuities. Sales were down slightly from the prior year quarter, when competitor dynamics resulted in elevated sales levels for Lincoln. Our results in the quarter remained aligned with our objectives. We have seen a slowing of fixed indexed annuity sales due to the lower interest rate environment. ","We maintained our strategic focus on increasing variable annuity sales without living benefits with sales up 79% from a year ago. The reach of our distribution, the size and quality of our whole selling force, and our product portfolio expansion all combined to advances toward achieving our organic goal of 30% of DA sales without a living benefit.","When factoring in the benefit of the reinsurance transaction, 56% of DA sales in the third quarter had no living benefits. Supporting this key strategy we launched in June our investment focused DA product Investor Advantage. It has achieved an impressive $100 million of sales in the first 100 days which is a testament to the strength of our distribution and the demand for this type of product in today\u2019s market. ","As we move forward our view of the annuity business remains unchanged, the right volume of sales and the profitability and risk profile of new business continue to make the annuity business very attractive.","Group protection; in group protection we are taking the right steps to improve profitability and to position our business for long-term success. As I\u2019ve stated before, we started implementing price increases in mid 2013 aimed primarily at our employer paid life and disability business. These pricing actions are achieving mid to upper single-digit increases in both new sales and renewals this year and we are again resting up our pricing targets as we renew 2015 business.","Additionally we are investing in programs to improve our disability claims management effectiveness which should further enhance our profit improvement. Although success maybe uneven from quarter-to-quarter and it will take time, we believe our profit improvement trajectory is positive. New business levels were lower than last year for the third quarter and for year-to-date although our pricing actions are a factor, industry sales are also down through mid year. ","An important element of our strategy is to capitalize on the growth of the more profitable employee paid market. We continued to advance our strategy with 49% of year-to-date sales coming from the employee paid segment up from 46% in the prior year. We are pleased that our total earned premium is up 7% for the quarter and up more than 9% year-to-date with our growth being fueled by higher margin in new business and increased pricing on renewals. In summary we are confident that we had the right programs in place to restore profitability and to sustain long-term profitable growth.","Moving to retirement plan services, it was another strong quarter with continued stable earnings benefitting from the 11% growth in average account values. Total deposits were down 13% from a year ago, attributable to lower new sales in the mid large market which can be uneven from time to time. ","With respect to the lumpiness of the business we were recently notified of a case termination due to an M&A transaction which will occur by the end of the year. The combined case size total was 4 billion of size where we choose not to compete aggressively. Approximately 600 million outflows were likely lead to negative flows in the fourth quarter but with little impact on earnings. We have a strong pipeline in the mid to large segment and we expect to return to positive net flows in the first quarter. ","Our small market strategy continues to take hold and we are seeing the results. Total deposits were up 24% from a year ago. In part these results were driven by the expansion of our small market sales force which is up 29% from a year ago. Equally as important as new sales is the growth we are seeing across all markets in recurring deposits which were up 8% compared to the prior year. The driver of this growth is our focus on the participant through our high touch model which is increasing participation in contribution rates. The number of participants contributing in the quarter was up 4% from a year ago and average contributions per participant were up 3%. ","Also aiding our recurring deposits was a strong overall retention in the third quarter, withdrawals at 8 percentage of average assets were down 2% as compared to a year ago. This will remain a focus for us going forward. We are happy with the overall progress in our retirement business and looking ahead we expect to see continued growth. Distribution had another strong quarter. Our retail, wholesale, and worksite teams continued to deliver outstanding results driving our core strategies to grow sales on our terms and shift our mix when necessary. ","In Lincoln financial distributors we expanded our individual life sales organization by 12% enabling us to deliver above industry sales growth and again to drive the diverse mix of sales that I mentioned earlier. Selling additional products through our strong producer base of more than 64,000 is a key strategy. The number of producers selling more than one Lincoln product is up 16% and we are seeing good traction in several areas. Most notably, one third of both small market RPS and MoneyGuard sales are driven by our strategic partners where we have multiple products on their platforms and cross sell programs in place.","Shifting to Lincoln financial network, our affiliated advisory network help steady at more than 8400. Of note for the quarter total sales were up 3% delivering more Lincoln sales than any other firm. Retail distribution is a key component of our product strategies and we are investing in capabilities to enhance our value proposition to advisors and their clients. ","Our group distribution continues to be a valuable business asset beyond just sales with its strong performance and supporting the placement of higher price renewals. Currently our combined group sales rep and enrollers count exceeds 350. You\u2019ve heard me say this before, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our already deep and powerful distribution with an eye on expanding our industry leading franchise of more than 1400 wholesale, retail, and work side professionals.","Turning to investment management, we continued to achieve strong new money yields in light of the low interest rate environment investing $2.5 billion at 4.3% which is 180 basis points over the average 10 year treasury during the quarter. Our disciplined AOM driven investment strategy has delivered a fixed income portfolio yield of 5.1% and about $7 billion of unrealized gains. Additionally, the flexibility from our yield enhancing debt program continues to help offset the low rate headwinds contributing 25 basis points in the third quarter to our new money yields.","Although the 10 year treasury had declined 20 basis points in the month of October, our new money yield have held at 4.3% benefitting primarily from spread widening. Our strategy of growing the alternative investment program is also contributing solid results with net investment income of $46 million during the quarter and 16% asset growth from the prior year. We continued to achieve consistent investment results, grow our yield enhancing strategy, and improved diversification while maintaining a high quality portfolio. ","As I close my remarks let me say again that Lincoln had a very good quarter. Our strong performance came as direct result of our ability to deliver unclear and consistent strategies and I am confident we are taking the steps necessary to finish out the year on a strong note. I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported income from operations of $414 million or $1.56 per share for the third quarter, up 16% from the prior year period. The quarter\u2019s earnings that was yet another record driven by strong performance in the annuity, life, and retirement businesses. As noted in the press release we had normalizing adjustment of 12 million or $0.05 per share in the quarter primarily attributable to our annual review of DAC assumptions. ","Similar to last year, the DAC unlocking process had a net positive impact on the results. In total this year\u2019s DAC unlocking resulted in a positive impact of $31 million with $6 million of the impact reflected in operating income, while $25 million occurs below the line in net income. These results underscore the quality of the DAC asset on our balance sheet and reflect the rigor applied to establishing the underlying assumptions in the respective businesses. ","The performance of other key financial measures remained strong including operating revenues up 9% to a record $3.4 billion while G&A net of capitalized expenses grew 4.3%. Book value per share excluding AOCI growing 9% to $48.23 and return on equity which increased to 13.4%. ","The investment portfolio produced excellent results in the quarter. Returns on alternative investments were particularly strong this quarter with our $1.2 billion portfolio earning an annualized return of 16%. This contributed $10 million above our expected levels to the quarters result.","Income from bond and mortgage prepayments was again stronger in the quarter however, as I noted on our last call that is expected in the current environment. Net income for the quarter of $439 million benefitted from a few positive items including the unlocking I mentioned earlier that more than offset $60 million of net realized losses. These strong net income results continue a trend that we have seen over the last few years with net income averaging 97% of operating income since the beginning of 2012.","Turning to segment results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter came in at $245 million which produced an ROE of 27% for the quarter. Operating revenues increased 12% from the prior year quarter on a very strong 21% increase in fees on assets under management. Sequential quarters of positive net flows and strong equity markets drove a 14% increase in average account values. The only item of note impacting annuity earnings for the quarter was the favorable $12 million coming from the annual assumption review.","This is another great result and is a testament to both the quality of our annuity business and the assumption that underlie its valuation. We believe the results are reflective of a theme that you have heard us talk about before. That is a theme of consistency, a consistent presence in the market place with a well designed product portfolio, a consistent approach to risk management that you see in the results of our hedge program, and a consistent and rigorous process to the establishment and review of assumptions.","I would also note that as we have gone through the assumption review process we have relied not just on our own experience but have brought in leading outside consultants to ensure that our assumption reflect the best data available. ","In retirement plan services we reported earnings of $40 million compared to $33 million in the prior year quarter. Revenues were up 1% year-over-year on higher fee revenue which increased 5% while net investment income remained flat reflecting the spread compression that the retirement business has been experiencing. ","Average account values of $54 billion increased 11% from the prior year period. Both the return on assets of 30 basis points and pretax margin of 35.5% improved from the year ago period and remained at the high end of our expectations. The retirement business has been posting steady and consistent results with the underlying story remaining unchanged, that is the growth in earnings from new business managing to offset the ongoing spread compression and producing a very attractive return on equity in excess of 16%.","The life insurance segment reported earnings in the quarter of $150 million compared to $140 million in the prior year. We saw yet another quarter of consistent growth in the life segments earnings drivers with average account balances up almost 7%, the life insurance in force increased 4% to $635 billion. This growth in earnings driver is allowing the life business to overcome spread compression that is running at about 8 to 12 basis points per year in today\u2019s interest rate environment.","Mortality was in line with expectations and the segment benefitted from 7 million of the alternative net investment income that I noted earlier. The results of the DAC assumption review for life was similar to what we saw in the other segments. A series of incremental adjustments with some pluses and minuses that in the case of the life segment netted to a negative $6 million. This negative unlocking impact was completely offset by other small favorable items. Overall it was a very good quarter for the life segments with underlying growth driven by profitable new business overcoming any headwind that low interest rates are creating. ","The group protection segment reported earnings of $8 million in the quarter down from $23 million in the year ago quarter. But up from the $2 million that we reported in the second quarter of this year. While it is encouraging that we saw loss ratio improvement across all product lines relative to the second quarter, earnings continue to be affected by adverse claim cost and long-term disability. As a result, group earnings will fall short of the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Specific to LTD, metrics were mixed in the quarter with recoveries driving the majority of the unfavorable experience of incidence performed in line with expectations. ","Claims management will impact the LTD loss ratios that we report on a quarterly basis. To minimize the potential volatility that it creates, we continue to invest in the claims function, adding staff as needed, providing the training necessary to properly adjudicate the claims, and recently installing a new claims management system. We are pleased with the market acceptance of our mid to upper single digit price increases on new and renewing business this year. And we are now targeting low double-digit increases for renewing business in 2015. ","The combination of improvements in claims management, price increases, and premium growth which was 7% this quarter that will improve profitability overtime. All that being said we will not be surprised by quarterly volatility consistent with what you\u2019ve seen from other leading group insurers. The bottom line for the group business is that earnings improvement will not be linear but with the actions we are undertaking we expect group protection to be a positive lever to Lincoln\u2019s long-term earnings growth. ","Turning to capital activities, we refer just 150 million of our shares during the quarter moving us to 450 million for the first nine months of the year, and announce a 25% increase in our shareholder dividend taking our annualized cash outlay for shareholder dividend to approximately 200 million. Statutory capital grew approximately $80 million over the quarter to $8.3 billion with RBC coming in at 507%. ","Statutory results are benefiting from the mix in our sales to let capital intensive products especially in the life business. In fact I estimate that this mix shift is costing approximately 100 million less of annual new business strength than the mix of business that we were selling just a few years ago. During the quarter we sent $175 million of dividends for the holding companies and ended the quarter with $572 million of cash. ","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter we expect the strong statutory performance in balance sheet towards in a very good position to exceed our full year guidance for 500 million to 550 million of share buybacks. To recap some key points, the statutory and GAAP balance sheets are both in a very strong position as evidence by record level of statutory capital, strong RBC and holding company cash positions, and no negative impact from the annual assumption review process. ","We are selling profitable business with each and every business earning 12 plus percent IRRs on new business except for the annuity business for a new business IRRs are in the 20% range. We are selling less capital intensive business which is favorably impacting statutory income. We are producing positive annualized net flows that total better than 3% of our comp balances, and the group business or earnings are still well below our long-term expectations is showing steady premium growth and gradually improving results. ","With these items along with others such as the strength of the equity markets over the past few years combining together to swamp 2% the 3% headwind to earnings growth that low interest rates are causing. With that let\u2019s move to Q&A. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from the line of Seth Weiss from Bank of America, your line is now open.","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank You. I am curious on commentary regarding the decision not to unlock GAAP for equity market reversions to mean assumptions and as of the second quarter I believe the buffer on the DAC asset or the amount that you would have released had you unlocked DAC was over $400 million. I suspect that when you disclose this number in the third quarter 10-Q at this level is going to look quite similar. As I believe this is the largest buffer in the last five years and with that as a backdrop maybe you could help us think through what level this needs to reach to trigger a positive unlock?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, Seth, the buffer remained largely the same in total across all the businesses that is roughly $350 million right now. That\u2019s really in line with where it\u2019s been for the last few periods or really not a big change in the level of buffer, it moves up some quarters, moves down some quarters. Really it is the thought that I have been talking about for some time now which is that we have a corridor process. We still remain inside that corridor and so there really was not an obvious reason to unlock the return assumption. Still very comfortable, both with our long-term return assumptions and with the reversion to the mean process that we have, the immediate reversion to mean process that we have. So very comfortable with where we are and that was the thought process that we went through Seth. ","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great, and just to clarify on the corridor I know you have two different corridors. When you say you are within, do you mean the wider corridor or still within even the narrow corridor?","Dennis R. Glass","We are towards the inside corridor, pretty close to inside corridor but [ethically] [Ph] still slightly inside [Inaudible].","Seth Weiss - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. ","Dennis R. Glass","","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Schwartz from Raymond James, please proceed.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Hey, good morning everybody. First, Dennis you go in a little too fast for me, can you go back over the case that was lost. I think that was retirement plan services, what those numbers were?","Dennis R. Glass","The net negative flow in the fourth quarter will be about $600 million, Steve, and I said that it have minimal earnings impact because inside of that net number we have retained the stable value assets which offset -- and the fees on that offset the loss of record keeping revenue.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, so this was a -- what was the total size of it?","Dennis R. Glass","The total size it was an M&A deal so it was one of the situations where we have talked about sort of a market fact that\u2019s going on, is that a lot of the health companies are merging. And so the two health companies\u2019 plans assets in total were about $4 billion and that is the segment of the market because it\u2019s been pricing to begin with and because oftentimes at that size you have to make specific changes to your activities that are costly. So we don\u2019t aggressively participate in that market. Again we are south of that in target that we go forward this mid to large. So that\u2019s the answer.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, the $600 million is what you expect out from that just one case, so that\u2019s not your expectation for total outflow for the fourth quarter?","Dennis R. Glass","It is pretty close to where do we expect to be in total but it is specifically the outcome.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, great. And then if I can a couple of one offs that I am interested in, particularly with regards to you, is - the treasury I mean just a few days ago approved the use of annuities and target date funds and of course you\u2019re a large annuity provider and you have RPS and I am wondering how you think about this?","Dennis R. Glass","The product inside the retirement plan is slightly different then the individual product with respect to living benefits. And we will need to manage in total our living benefit exposure and it\u2019s not an earnings mix issue, it\u2019s more about the balance sheet capability to have handled living benefits. So we think it\u2019s a good development, specifically the one that you are talking about. We have a product to participate in that marketplace and we\u2019ll manage the overall mix of our living benefit book of business. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","And then one more if I can. I am not sure it matters any more given the change of your life sales mix but thoughts on direct to report and the potentiality of AG47, Dennis?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, so you\u2019re referring specifically to the progress that\u2019s being made in the discussion of the use of captives on a go forward basis.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Dennis R. Glass","Lincoln has taken the lead with a couple of other life companies in discussing this with the regulators. My first point would be that there is firm agreement that any changes will only be perspective changes with respect to captives, and so the industry's existing captive arrangements will remain in place. To your point, the change in our mix reduces the need for us to do additional captive financings but remember we do them both on term business and guaranteed universal life. So we will be increasing our terms sales a little bit more. But in total we don\u2019t have as much need for the captive arrangements as we\u2019ve had in the past. Having said that I think even the new rules that will apply to captives once they are put in place will benefit -\u2013 we will be benefitted by using captives to again even though it will be a smaller amount than we\u2019ve done in the past.","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay, thanks, Dennis very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi, first on the retirement business. Overall obviously your results are pretty strong but retirement flows were weak, so just wondering if you could talk about whether this is just an aberration and a normal volatility in the business or is it related to the competitive environment especially in the large - mid to large case markets? And then secondly on your actuarial review, can you just talk about what your interest rate assumptions are that are better than your accounts and how whether or not you changed them this quarter?","Dennis R. Glass","Okay, I\u2019ll take the first question. Let me emphasize the positives first and then come back to the mid to large which is more neutral. We did see significant growth in small case sales. We saw a significant growth in the recurring deposits in both the large case -- mid to large and small case so that\u2019s all positive going in the right direction. ","We had said in the past and it continues to be the case that the mid to large case marketplace is a bit more competitive than small case market. And so it\u2019s tougher to win. Having said that I\u2019d also take you back a couple of quarters and remind you that we upgraded substantially our technology but while we are in that phase of installing a new administrative platform, the consultants -- I don\u2019t want to say put us in a -- took us off the list completely but they didn\u2019t advocate Lincoln as much when you were in a transition from one administrative platform as we were in that transition to a new administrative platform. ","So just in the last 15 to 18 months, the consultant community which is where you get your mid to large case business has put us on the list more often and I think that our position in the market is growing, the recognition of Lincoln is growing, and that we\u2019ll see better results in the mid to large case market over time. Having said that, it\u2019s still a very competitive market. We have as I mentioned in my notes, we have a pretty significant pipeline of sales but we have to get out and win that business to convert it into real sales. ","So dynamics are different but we are optimistic that the steps that we are taking, the investments that we are making will move sales and that [goes] [ph] up over the next several years.","Randal J. Freitag","Jimmy, its Randy on your second question. Point out that there are two aspects for the interest rate assumption. First, there is the process we go through every year where we reset the beginning rates and what\u2019s other taker to the current interest rate environment. And we did that, we do that every year, and we did that again this year. That was a modest negative impact inside of the overall unlocking process. So of course we did that. ","Second component is the longer-term interest rate assumption, 575 for life insurance, 525 in the annuity business in our case, and we did not change that. We are still very comfortable with that long-term assumption. I remind you that we agreed to that assumption over a period of many years 6 or 7 years I believe. So Dennis mentioned we currently are investing money at 430 and when you think about our blending of 525, 575 you are really talking about our rate increase expected over the next 6 years of 125 basis points or so. You know that\u2019s really not that dramatic an increase its inline with a lot of expectations I see whether I\u2019m talking to our asset managers whether I am looking at expectations in Federal Reserve or for what the treasure rates may ultimately do or whether I am looking at the forward curve. So very comfortable with long term rates. We did not change them this year.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And then the increase in rates assumed is that gradual overtime or is it more front end of back end both?","Randal J. Freitag","It\u2019s a linear rate.","Jimmy Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath from UBS, please proceed.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on the corridor for Randy. I think in your answer to Seth\u2019s question you\u2019d said 350 million is the mean reversion but I believe that\u2019s just for the annuity business and if there is another bit in retirement and life bringing the total to 425 is that right?","Randal J. Freitag","No, the 350 is in total but it\u2019s roughly 280 in the annuity business and 70 million in the other two businesses. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay, because I am just looking at the page 46 of your Q from last quarter and I say 350 pretax annuities, are we doing pretax versus after tax, is that the difference?","Randal J. Freitag","No, I am talking pretax. Those are the actual numbers this quarter. You got to remember that we go through in the unlocking process and everything and those impacts can change modestly overtime. 350 total.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay, got it. And then on your comment about the strain, the 100 million less of strain. Frankly it\u2019s good to see that finally coming through. Is that in the quarter or that\u2019s for the full year and is that a pretax or after tax kind of number?","Randal J. Freitag","It\u2019s an after tax annualized impact and simply that -- you remember in years past I\u2019ve been very clear that the strain on new business, life insurance new business is roughly a dollar for each dollar of sales. When you look at what was the mix of business we are selling today, it\u2019s roughly $0.85. So $0.15 of less strain for $1 sales and if you look at the level of life sales we have you get to $100 million of less annual strains. I would also note that you really see in that and the results also. So if you look at our DAC operating earnings year-to-date we are right about $750 million. We were at $250 million in the third quarter and that\u2019s up over previous year. So you are really seeing that impact in our results. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","And are you expecting that 100 million as we look forward over the next couple of years, how much is -- how significant of a change are we going to see to that number or you kind of that\u2019s your base line at this point?","Randal J. Freitag","I am not going to go beyond saying that we have 100 million right now. I mean the mix of business that we sell going forward we\u2019ll be what it is. But we\u2019ve talked about the repricing of the products, the fact that our mix today is less capital intensive, lower level of GUR (ph) sales being the primary driver there. Dennis talked about, we will see term sales continuing about a little bit but I don\u2019t think you are going to see a dramatic change.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just the last one on the re-pricing, you know, Dennis I think you\u2019ve talked about 12% to 15% unlevered returns for most of your businesses, ex annuities, can you give us a sense of what interest rate assumption is sort of embedded in that 12% to 15% pricing return.","Dennis R. Glass","Let me come at it in a different way. And say that the 12% to 15% of course is a curve in it and it has periodic payments in the pricing. Even if you took today\u2019s yield curve, we\u2019d still be in that range that I talked about.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay, but I guess if we are assuming a rising rate environment eventually at some point down the road, if you kind of pricing for current rates then obviously there should be some upside potential to that 12% to 15% unlevered return?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Yes, you said yes, right?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, I am sorry I moved away from the speaker there. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","That\u2019s alright, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse, please proceed.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning, few questions first one, Randy within your separate accounts is the mix rate within durable annuities, is the mix now roughly half equities, half fixed income, and balanced funds is that about right or can you tell me what it is if it\u2019s not?","Randal J. Freitag","Tom, I don\u2019t know the exact mix that way. What I do know there is that our overall equity mix inside of all the funds they were as managed or directly chosen by the client is in the 65% range. Then the balance would be in long-term bond funds or have some alternative investment options in there.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got you, so 65 equities and 35\u2026 ","Randal J. Freitag","Roughly. ","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Roughly, okay. And to circle back to the whole review process and future assumptions. I guess the one that I still struggle with and maybe you could just help me think through philosophically where your head is at on this, is assume separate account returns and the fact that I think Lincoln is one of the few companies that hasn\u2019t reset the fixed income, assume return component just given where rates are, and I believe you\u2019re still at 8 for a blended average long-term return assumption. So how are you thinking about balancing out where we are with interest rates and why that assumption hasn\u2019t been reset?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, it hasn\u2019t been reset because we are very comfortable with our long-term earn rate assumption. And I am not going to dig down into the pieces of fixed income or equity but overall our long-term rate assumption for the various cohorts of business range from 7% to 9%. 7% for the more recent business, 9% for the older business. Weighted average of those is 8.2%, when you factor in the 14% immediate reversion to the mean that brings the overall average down to 7.4%. So very comfortable with those levels. ","In fact I\u2019d looked at some recent proprietary information, return information from across the industry and those numbers Tom are really not out of lack with any of our major peer companies. So I am very comfortable, it seems that they are right in line with the industry. When I look at a high level and try not to get down into the weeds of this component there or that components this. So once again very comfortable and it is consistent with what I see across the industry. ","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Understood. Another question I had, that\u2019s been coming up recently is several European insurers and reinsurers who have big U.S. operations have had mortality issues whether it\u2019s embedded value or specific accounting charges. There has been I would say significant weakness here. And now you all just went through an annual review process and you didn\u2019t find any issues, can you help shed some light on what you think might be different for Lincoln versus some of these other competitors of yours?","Randal J. Freitag","Well you know that in the first quarter this year we had elevated mortality talking specifically in \u2013 business individualized business. Last two quarters mortality comes right along with their expectations. So, we invest pretty consistent with what we see historically, typically the fourth quarter, if you want to use history as your reference it would typically be a little better quarter for mortality. So that\u2019s -- our experience has been in line with what we\u2019ve experienced in years past. Inside of the assumption review, once again I didn\u2019t talk about assumption by assumption by assumption its particular impact. We reset our mortality consistent with what our experience are these days. And in total I talked about what the overall impact of the unlocking were. So we haven\u2019t seen a dramatic change in our mortality and I am not really familiar with what you are referring to in terms of what the European insurers are seeing. But we\u2019ve updated our DAC assumption for our experience today and the impacts are what I just talked about. ","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","The Europeans having been flagging late 90s to mid 2000s issues in particular some guarantee -- some 10 year level term resets and adverse experience there and then they have also flagged incidence of increased suicides, I\u2019ve heard some of them have flagged. So I don\u2019t know if any of those issues you\u2019ve noticed anything on any of those fronts.","Dennis R. Glass","Tom what makes it difficult for us to comment on your question is that we don\u2019t know what mortality assumptions they had themselves in place at that time. You recall there was a period of time where the direct writers were reinsuring a 100% of their -- almost a 100% of their mortality because the reinsurers were so aggressive. It\u2019s just very hard for us to comment on somebody else's experience because I believe it has an element of what they thought it should have been right.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Dennis that\u2019s a very fair point and then that\u2019s a good segue into my last question which is I know I think this is several years ago you all had put out some information that showed your actual to expected for mortality was exceptional. I think it was in the 70% to 80% range and that could very well explain why you are not having issues because your accounting was very conservatively looking at that issue. Do you have an update on where that stands actual to expected mortality?","Randal J. Freitag","Actual to expected mortality experience of course it is going to bounce around year-to-year but there hasn\u2019t been a material change from where we were two three years ago Tom.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","So it is in -- Randy, would you say in that 70% to 80% range, its broad but is that directionally right?","Randal J. Freitag","Tom I think somewhere along the way we recast the denominator, so expect a level for the older business. I mean talking about the really old business. So I think factually if you look at those numbers it\u2019s more like the mid 80s. ","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Mid 80s, okay. Thanks a lot.","Randal J. Freitag","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner from FBR Capital Markets, please proceed.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Thank you very much. I wanted to just kind of dig into the group piece and just get some color or updates on a few items. I guess one is just on the continued elevation of claims if you can kind of share with us whether that\u2019s an incident or recovery or other item. I think mainly between those two items that claims have been bouncing around kind of three last four quarters. So maybe we could start there and just get a feel for how those items are evolving as you continue to address this block?","Randal J. Freitag","Randy, I think consistent with my comments that you continue to see some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. This particular quarter as I mentioned the LTD experience on the downside was driven by recoveries that were little lower than we have been experiencing but on the other hand incidents that came right in line with our a longer term expectations. I\u2019ve got sort of the opposite of what you saw last quarter. So you are seeing some volatility quarter-to-quarter. The other thing I mentioned is just around claims management. You think about what our core mission in claims management is, it is too properly pay claims and then help people get back to work. And as I mentioned we continue to do the things we need to do to make sure we can do that, right. We are growing as a company so we need to keep adding staff. ","The nature of claims change all the time so we need to make sure we\u2019re giving our staff the proper training they need to properly adjudicate clients. And then we need to make sure they have the best tools available so, we just invested in new claims management system. So you are going to see quarter-to-quarter volatility but I think we are doing things we need to do overtime to make sure that we are getting the best outcome.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Is there a way, I mean, I guess your business is growing you mentioned that\u2019s why you are adding claims staff, is there a way to kind of quantify how much bigger the staff is on a per claim basis or per unit basis versus where it was before?","Randal J. Freitag","You know Randy, I wouldn\u2019t look much different then what our premium gross was 7% in the quarter, 9% year-to-date I believe. And as we grow, we\u2019ll have more claims and we would need more staff to manage those claims. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay, I was reading it as more like a build out of the staff but I guess you are saying it\u2019s increasing with the size of the book?","Randal J. Freitag","Absolutely.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay and then last I guess \u2013 I think that low double-digit price increases were expected there going forward. I guess to me that seems a little bit higher than what we\u2019d expect and what we are seeing from others. Can I just get a -- get more color on how that\u2019s going to phase in and how you think that might match up versus competitors?","Dennis R. Glass","Sure, as a reminder what I was talking about we have a big renewal book that comes in the first quarter of 2015, right. So first quarter is our biggest part of the year. And when you think about renewals, so when we are looking at renewals for that period we are now targeting low double-digit price increases for that renewal book as opposed to the mid-to-upper single digit price increases that we have been targeting this year. So that\u2019s what I am referring to when I talk about low double-digit increases. And I guess it\u2019s pretty obvious but it depends when you are trying to compare that against what the other competitors are saying, where they are starting from in terms of the need to increase prices. Were they higher than us to begin with so again I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s very hard to mathematically compare. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Right.","Randal J. Freitag","I\u2019d never said any price increase is easy but in total I believe you described the market as broad, sweet, accepting of the price increases that we are putting in the marketplace and that we are not seeing large swing and persistent difference.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Okay and another detailed question, I may have missed this in the call but variable income or your non-core income from investments I think was higher in the quarter. Did you quantify what that was, kind of above plan for the quarter for the overall complex?","Randal J. Freitag","First off I wouldn\u2019t describe it as non-core, alright. So it\u2019s part of what we do. We have about $1.2 billion alternative investment book which is split between private equity and hedge funds that we\u2019ve talked about, a longer term strategy to grow about a little bit maybe another couple hundred million dollars over the next couple of years. So it is core to what we do. It added $10 million to the bottom-line in the quarter.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","$10 million above what you would normally expect from that alternative book?","Randal J. Freitag","Exactly right. I should have clarified that, above what we would normally expect. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","Yes, I know this is noncore but alternative is definitely the right word, that\u2019s what I was looking for, thanks so much.","Randal J. Freitag","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Nadel from Sterne, Agee, please proceed with your question.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hi, good morning everybody. I had two questions one, I just want to talk about indexed universal life for a few minutes or at least get your thoughts on this, and it seems like this has become a much greater percentage UL that is of overall industry wide retail life insurance sales over the last couple of years. And we\u2019ve heard that regulators are starting to take a closer look at this product as a result and maybe some of the sales illustrations and practices now that it\u2019s reached that level. I know it\u2019s not as big a percentage of your life sales but I am just wondering whether you are hearing that same thing and how you think Lincoln is prepared in handling some of the investment returns that are being illustrated?","Dennis R. Glass","Let me sort of paint a broad picture. Index universal life is a good product and by and large the illustration industry wide has been reasonably responsible, but there is some outliers. And importantly I think the illustration generalizing here that illustration that are being used today don\u2019t produce much more upside than what the customers have actually seen over the last decade or two in this product. Again I am being very general. ","With the changes in the capital markets and how index UL is crediting your rate mechanism is being reviewed and is in fact it\u2019s being looked at for the last three years. And so it\u2019s probably true that well, let me say it differently what\u2019s come out of this three year review is suggesting some guard rails here, there, and yonder to be more clear with the customer the range of outcomes that you might get from this crediting rate mechanism. ","So I think it\u2019s healthy for the industry to go through this. There is some tug and pull between parts of the industry on what the guard rails should actually be. But this is in my view a positive discussion from the perspective that we want to make sure industry wide that all of the illustration, whether it\u2019s for index universal life or whole life policies provides the customer with a range of expectations about the future that are appropriate, and again that there is appropriate guard rail so that the industry in total is illustrating in a way that\u2019s good for the consumer.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Got it, okay and guard rails I assume Dennis that you mean you know limitations on the upper boundary on illustrated investment returns?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right and this is all very technical but over the last couple of years if a particular portfolio of investments produced much higher returns than the S&P 500 and a particular company happen to have that as their base in what they conveyed to their customers, what the customers got maybe exactly what was illustrated. But I think in general, the view is that we should sort of tighten the guard rails so that there is not sort of a unique situation that for a short period of time produced above expectation that over a long period of time you might otherwise see.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Very helpful, thank you and then you also mentioned Dennis up front in your commentary a recent volatility in the markets and obviously managing Lincoln through periods like this. I was thinking about the volatility over the last couple of weeks you know really related to some of the volatility managed funds and you guys have seen a good inflow of assets into your introduced volatility managed funds and I think the industry has as well. I am just wondering more color than anything else over the last few weeks, how have you seen those funds performing, are they doing what you expect them to do such that you don\u2019t need to have the hedging program as robust outside of the funds?","Dennis R. Glass","I think the answer to that is generally yes, but protected funds overlay on the underlying sub accounts is performing according to expectations. And I would add to that the protective funds is volatility overlay is really a very long term concept. And so in any particular quarter if the overlay produced better or worse results then you might expect, that\u2019s just a quarter. And it is just, as we\u2019ve looked at and believe me we are looking at this very closely, we are satisfied that the overlay is doing what it should do. Again we look at it over a full market cycle, not a two or three week period. And the answer to your other question, the overall hedge program is still robust and it is less costly because of the overlay to Lincoln.","Randal J. Freitag","And certainly I\u2019m not trying to draw any conclusions from a couple of weeks but these types of products seem to be relatively early in their life cycle. So just wondering how they performed, what really was the most volatile period we\u2019ve had in probably about a year so.

So good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's First Quarter Earnings Call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim. And good morning, everyone. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for us with all of our businesses delivering good results. Let me share some highlights.","We ended the first quarter with operating return on equity north of 11% on book value per share growth of 4.5%. The revenue growth in excess of 3% was also an indicator that we are delivering on many of the plans we have discussed during the past year. Specifically, increased deposits and net flows in Retirement Plan Services and increased sales in Group Protection demonstrate that the strategic investments we are making in these areas are paying off. In addition, we are successfully executing the strategy to direct Life sales to higher return products. I will speak more about this in a minute, but this pivot strategy is something we have shared with you in the past.  And finally, our strong capital development from earnings, combined with our view that our share price remains undervalued, led us to accelerate our share buybacks.","Let me now comment on our underlying businesses. Life Insurance sales for the quarter were $122 million, down from a year ago. This decline was expected, primarily as a result of pricing actions taken on our secondary guarantee universal life product  [indiscernible] to continued low interest rates. In implementing our changes many companies have followed our lead in the making similar price adjustments, but not all of our competitors have taken action yet. Having said this, our pivot strategy, again moving to higher return life products, is taking hold. Sales of our indexed universal, variable universal and term life products were collectively up 11%. Moving forward, our ability to continue executing this strategy and produce strong results will be driven by the breadth, depth and capability of our distribution team. This strength gives us an edge when bringing to market the right consumer solution [indiscernible] appropriately.","Turning to the annuity business. In life, [indiscernible] the variable annuity competitive landscape has shifted in recent months. I believe that the majority of companies that remain in this space offer good consumer value and price their products appropriately. At Lincoln Financial, we are pleased with where we are positioned in the industry. And we have maintained a consistent market presence. As I have said before, we remain more interested in offering products on our terms using sound pricing assumption than we are on taking market share. Positive net flows in the quarter helped drive record annuity account balances of $92 billion. Variable annuity sales for the quarter were up 8% sequentially, driven primarily by strong equity market performance and consistent with overall industry trend. Involving the design of our income product, by recently introducing a series of protected funds, is a good option for consumers and is also good for Lincoln. Good for consumers because they can lower the volatility of the returns and good for Lincoln because they reduce our hedging costs.","Fixed annuity sales in the quarter were down due to low interest rates. We are very pleased [indiscernible] that our new strategic partnership with Primerica has already generated $50 million of indexed annuity sales through April. Our relationship with Primerica gives us access to the middle-market, broadening our distribution and product reach to this large consumer market, and helping to diversify our annuity product offerings.","In our Retirement Plan Services business, our strategic investments, notably in technology upgrades and in the expansion of our wholesale and network, helped us deliver solid results. Total deposits of $1.5 billion, were up 13% versus the prior year, resulting in our third straight quarter of positive flows. Our strong performance this quarter was paced by significant growth in the small market with new sales coming in at $190 million, up 74% from the prior year. In addition, recurring deposits of $1.2 billion grew 15% from the prior year, reflecting the success of our 300-person work site distribution team getting participants to enroll and consolidate their assets with Lincoln.","In Group Protection, first quarter sales of $67 million increased by 47% from soft results in the year-ago quarter. Sales strength is broad-based and helped by an increase in voluntary sale, which is our strategic direction. Looking ahead, our distribution strength, our competitive product suite and continuing strong proposal activity position us well to capitalize on opportunities in the group marketplace in the near and long-term.","Turning to distribution. Retail, wholesale and work site distribution remain a source of strength for Lincoln. These networks help drive the company's strategy by executing on our product pivot strategy in life, positioning through protected funds in annuities and leading accelerated sales growth in our Retirement Plan Services and Group Protection businesses. Combined, our distribution networks open us up to new markets and drive consistent productivity.","Before I turn over the call to Randy for his comments, let me close by saying that we have a very strong franchise and a sound balance sheet to go with it. The progress we have made through short-term actions that respond to macroeconomic trends and through long-term investment strategies that chart future growth combined to help drive increased operating ROE and book value growth we experienced this quarter.","With that, I'll turn things over to Randy. Randy?","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $296 million or $1 per share for the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, there was very little noise in the reported results with normalized earnings coming in at $1, right on top of reported results. ","Overall, the results were consistent with our expectations and I described the quarter as both high quality and reflective of many themes that we have discussed over the past year. First, that we have a business model that will generate growth, even in a low interest rate environment, as demonstrated by year-over-year normalized earnings growth of 3%. Second, that our strong capital position will allow us to continue to return capital to shareholders as we executed upon another $150 million of share repurchases during the quarter. This, along with previous buybacks, led to normalized EPS growth of 12%. And third, that we would be making investments in key growth Businesses. While this is negatively impacting current earnings, it is building the platform for future earnings growth.","Let me provide some color on the G&A picture. In the space, G&A increased a little over 9%. I'd note that roughly 1\/3 of that increase was due to pure accounting driven noise around how on [ph] accounts and elements of differed comp with the offset to the expense coming through a lower share count. The remaining increase is made up of normal expense growth and strategic investments that we are making. Looking forward, I don't expect large increases in the strategic investment component relative to what we experienced in the current quarter. The key valuation drivers of book value and return on equity both improved during the quarter with book value per share, excluding AOCI, climbing nearly 4.5% to $37.25 while ROE came in at 11.2%.","Turning to net income. We reported net income of $245 million for the quarter. The only item of note affecting net income was the unhedged NPR reserve which caused a loss of $84 million. Outside of the noneconomic accounting noise that is the NPR, our annuity hedge programs and general account both had excellent quarters. Turning in a $34 million gain between the 2 items.","Turning to segment results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $137 million. Revenues were flat compared to the year-ago quarter and up 6% sequentially. Expense assessment growth during the quarter was muted roughly 1% by the fact that the majority of writer fees are assessed against the guaranteed account value. This will typically produce slower growth in rising markets and a more stable revenue stream in falling markets. Interest spreads remain strong in the annuity business. Looking forward, I expect to see only minimal pressure in economic interest spreads with any decline, primarily to new business that will put on with lower required interest margins.","As I've spent time with analysts and investors, it's becomes obvious that there are those who struggle with the risk-reward dynamics of the annuity business. From my seat, I want to note how comfortable I am with this business, whether it's the return profile that we've experienced over the years, the demographics that drive demand for our products or our industry-leading VA hedge program, we have shown and we will continue to show that the annuity business, if approached in the right way, is a great business.","Retirement Plan Services produced another solid quarter all around. Earnings of $35 million were driven by higher account values that hit a record $42 billion in the quarter. Interest spread performance was very good during the quarter with rate cuts offsetting the impact of lower reinvestment rates. Looking forward, I'd expect to see spread compression of 10 to 15 basis points a year, but I'll remind you, that all products we sell today are sold at very low guaranteed interest rates, in the 1.5% range, and that will mitigate the impact of spread compression over time.","Return on assets came in at 34 basis points for the quarter. We are seeing a shift in Retirement's business mix that will result in modest declines in ROA of 1 to 2 basis points a year. Although we expect this impact to be more than overcome through strong growth in sales and assets.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $142 million were flat with the prior year quarter. Earnings growth in the Life segment is muted by the removal of capital related to reserved financing transactions that we did last year. This negatively impacted the current quarter's earnings growth by 6% relative to the first quarter of 2011. Of course, we've used the capital freed up by those transactions to support the share repurchases that we've done over the last year. When viewed in total, impact has been a positive for EPS. Reported revenue growth of 7.5% was elevated by the work we did in 2011 migrating to a single valuation system. I'd put normalized revenue growth in the range of 5%, consistent with account balances that grew in excess of 5%.","Interest spreads increased in the quarter relative to the fourth quarter of last year due to interest crediting rate actions taken during the quarter. Looking forward, I'd expect to see 10 to 15 basis points of spread compression, per year, in today's rate environment. This is consistent with our prior guidance on the impact of low interest rates.","Group Protection business delivered a strong quarter of top line growth as premiums grew 6%. Elevated mortality caused a roughly 1 percentage point increase in the loss ratio relative to the first quarter of 2011. This pushed the loss ratio just outside the high-end of our expected range of 71% to 74%. We have analyzed this quarter's mortality experience and see this quarter as nothing other than one of those mortality blips that will occur from time to time. On the disability side, incidence has returned over long-term expectations. I see this as a positive as we look forward, although as long as the economy stays muted, I will retain a note of caution on my positive outlook.","Before moving to Q&A, let me touch on a couple of additional topics. First on capital and capital management. Life company capital remained level during the quarter, at $7.6 billion, as strong statutory earnings of approximately $250 million were offset by dividends to the holding company of $150 million and a reduction in our deferred tax asset. RBC came in at approximately 500%, down slightly from year end. And cash at the holding company exceeded $800 million at the end of the quarter as we took advantage of favorable markets to prefund our third quarter debt maturity. From a share buyback front, we reported another 6 million shares for a total cost of $150 million. Looking out over the remainder of 2012, capital generation, that is benefiting from favorable equity markets and the reduced level of life sales, should allow us to exceed our original guidance for $400 million of capital management. As you know, I don't give specific at the guidance around share repurchases. Our actions over the last 1.5 years are part of an intentioned strategy. Simply put, our current capital position is very strong and we will allocate that capital to the most productive uses while still protecting our valuable franchises.","Let me finish up my comments by noting that I find our current valuation to be at odds with the actions that we have taken and the results that are flowing from those actions, including: Share repurchases of $750 million over the last 6 quarters; a 60% increase in shareholder dividends for 2012; multiple price increases in life products that were particularly impacted by low interest rates; risk reduction across our general accounts that has reduced below investment grade holdings by nearly 4%; book value per share that has continued to grow over the last year despite the decision that we made to write off $750 million of goodwill at the end of 2011; and last but definitely not least, return on equity that has been steadily improving and came in at 11.2% in the current quarter.","We'll continue to do the things that we need to do to produce those sorts of results going forward. And I firmly believe that will eventually be reflected in our valuation. With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the Retirement business. One of your competitors is getting out and I think another, at least one of your competitors has already kind of seized some of their distribution relationships and taken some share. Are you able to kind of take advantage of that situation and gain some share in the near term?","Dennis R. Glass","Jeff, as I said in my remarks, first of all, we're more focused on the companies that remain in the business than we are the ones that go out. And as I said, I think the companies that remain in the business are high-quality companies with good management. We're not expecting big increases in market share because of a couple of exits from the industry. We're comfortable with the kind of growth that we're seeing. We continue to price our products appropriately. And again, we don't expect, to answer your question specifically, any big increase in the -- I presume this was the Retirement business that you were talking about.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm talking about the Retirement business, exactly.","Dennis R. Glass","I mean, the Retirement businesses, I'm sorry, or the VA business?","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","The Retirement Plans business.","Dennis R. Glass","Oh, I'm sorry, I was answering on the VA business. We're pretty committed to our program there. We're in the right segments. We're expanding our distribution, our technology. We're achieving our pricing targets. Some of the growth that we've seen this year has come, as I've mentioned, from the strength of our distribution. Two particular cases, one is the increased productivity of our wholesalers in the small group market that had more tenure and the other one is this 300-person strong work site marketing group that goes and visits, specifically, with our client firms' employees to try to increase their retirement contributions. Again, you saw that 15%. So we're getting our returns. We're making progress. We think it's a good business. And I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ed Spehar with Bank of America.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The question I had -- Dennis, in the past, you've given us some sense of where your pricing is in the life business relative to competitors. I'm wondering if you could update that given the some of your comments about price action you've seen in the market following yours?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, Ed, there's been some movement. I would say, that in the level-pay area, roughly speaking, we're 3% to 10% across-the-board on our product's off-the-top pricing. Where it's only 3%, we can compete pretty well on that. In the single-pay area, we're still kind of double-digit percentages off the lead players in these markets. So we're going to continue to see and intentionally sell a decline in contribution of short-pay type payment -- excuse me, short-pay premium type of products.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the one follow-up to that would be, given the decline in life sales that we saw in the quarter, how much of a benefit did you see in the quarter from -- to statutory earnings as a result of the decline in the first quarter sales?","Dennis R. Glass","Randy, and I have talked about this before. I'm mean, rough justice, $1 less of a premium is $1 more of capital.","Edward A. Spehar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And that generally worked out in that fashion, the first quarter?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Ed, that did. During the quarter, as I mentioned, we had stat earnings of $250 million. That's above the sort of $200 million level that you have seen us experience in the past and that benefited from 2 items, both the lower level of life sales and the favorable markets during the quarter. But it was a strong quarter from a stat operating earnings standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Giovanni from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dennis, you guys have obviously shown discipline and commitment to shrinking business where appropriate and I'm curious what the response has been from your distribution partners.","Dennis R. Glass","The company is run very tightly so that our distribution organization, internally, is obviously aligned on our strategy. And as I've said, the ability of our distribution organization to take that out to our partners and explain why we're doing it and the consequences, both to them and to us, of it, is understood and accepted. We're pretty delighted that the -- and this takes time to do. Let's just take an individual life producer. If he's been building a practice around single-pay or periodic-pay, SGUL sales, it's going to take some amount of time to have him understand, say for example, the benefit of an indexed UL sale. But as I said, that shift is occurring off a small base of 11%, and our success this year will be to be able to continue to do that. So in short, we're taking the message to our distribution partners. It's being well received and understood, and it's up to us to implement it and execute on it. It's interesting, and just one fact, we made some pretty significant changes in the wires on some of the compensation and the wires took our compensation structure and asked everyone else to meet it. And so there's some leadership demonstrated there.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just on capital. You've clearly also shown a commitment to accelerating share repurchases based on the share price. But you also have made comments in the past about wanting to get bigger in the Group business as well as the Retirement business. And there are some of those properties that are on the market, so should be expect that M&A is a possibility or do you believe share purchases, just given where the share price is, will continue to be the primary use of capital?","Dennis R. Glass","We've been pretty clear that we're anxious to organically, first and foremost, build and increase our Group and Retirement businesses. We spend 100% of our time trying to figure out how to build them organically. At the same time, with a clear path for organic growth, from time to time, a property might come along that's consistent with the type of business, the type of distribution that you're trying to build. And so there is some economic advantage to accelerating your organic growth plans with a property that's consistent with those organic growth plans. Let me make 2 comments on that. One, it takes money to grow Group business and the Retirement Plan business. We're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars of investments in those 2 areas over the next couple of years. So if we have an investment that we can make that offsets that, well, that might make sense. Second thing I would say, more specifically to your question about share repurchase versus acquisitions, if it's not a dollar-for-dollar equivalency -- when you do share repurchases you're taking capital out of the company, which reduces book equity and has other consequences -- and again we're happy to do that, we're going to continue to do that -- when you make an acquisition, capital is staying in the company. So you're not, for example, reducing your equity. Therefore, lowering your ability to meet your debt-to-equity ratios. So I think that covers it. Again, you have to, I hope -- let me just underscore 3 points. You have to invest to grow the business. If you do an acquisition that offsets some of that investment, the dollars that you spend on that investment aren't gross their net. And that share buybacks, which we'll continue to do, we've demonstrated that we're going to do them, are not dollar-for-dollar with making a strategic investment. Okay?","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I have a question about AXXX. I haven't seen this in the release or anywhere else. Has there been any material AXXX transactions completed this year?","Randal J. Freitag","Not by us, Randy. We have not done a transaction in the first quarter. As you remember, we did 3 last year. That was more than we typically do in a year. So when I've talked about this year -- what I've said is that I don't have one in my base plans. But we're going to work very hard to see if we can execute on another one.","Edward Shields - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Well, a couple of follow-ups there. I guess my impression was that the plan was to at least have 1 or 2 that freed up around $200 million of capital. So is that still the plan or could we expect to maybe not see one at all?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. So, in a typical year, we sort of plan on maybe we can do a couple of hundred million dollars of capital generation. Last year, we did 3 transactions and generated an excess of $200 million. And you saw that in the capital manage we did last year, when we did a total of about $800 million of buybacks and de-levering. So, coming into this year, we start that same sort of focus, $400 million of capital management. We'll try to go out and do additional reserved financing transactions and other things, like the reduced life sales which are generating incremental capital, that's going to allow us to add to that $400 million level.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just one more, if I could. Is there something -- rates are still low, the equity markets higher. I mean, is there is cap? Can you just give us quick color on kind of the capital markets dynamics and demand for these types of transactions?","Randal J. Freitag","I think the supply is definitely out there. In fact, I would say that prices have continued to come down on the transaction proposals that we see floating around out there. So there is a very robust market with our investment banking partners, and bank partners primarily, for these sorts of structures. Good, long dated structures at a very good price, that's actually below what we've priced for in these transactions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","I just want to go back to your comments regarding the Disability business. And you've had decent results whereas others have continued to struggle or are actually seeing some deterioration in their business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that. And then just generally speaking, in the group business overall, you had really good sales growth and  was wondering how you reconcile that with the fact that all your competitors are talking about very soft pricing conditions?","Dennis R. Glass","Randy and I'll take aspects of that question. So let me, Randy, go first. Let me just come back to sales. I said they were up strong, off a soft quarter. But having said that, they were broad-based. So sales by industry classifications remains stable. We've seen solid growth across all case sizes. Our proposal activity remains strong. Back to pricing -- a little bit on pricing. Last quarter, we got into detailed comments. Kind of hurt our sales efforts because it was a competitive situation. So we're not going to speak to specific price of changes in the marketplace anymore. But what I will tell you is that we are getting our ROEs from new business in 12%-plus range with the business that we're selling. Randy, you may want to expand on that.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Joanne. On your last point of your comment. What I hear from competitors, the few calls that I listen to and discussions I've had, is that a lot of people see a market that is actually hardening. That's what I've heard from a number of competitors. So I haven't heard, necessarily, the softening comment that you made there at the end. It's the other way, actually. So, feel pretty good that the market is hardening, consistent with the actions we've taken over the last couple of years in this business. The Disability business is a good, high-quality business. There are a number of things you have to think about when you're pricing a disability case. As I mentioned, we've seen incidents come down to our historic levels and very happy about that. But undoubtedly, we have to continue to be cautious and continue to be very disciplined in a business like this, which has some linkages to how the overall economy is performing.","Dennis R. Glass","Just one more comment on my side. You really have a to parse out, we talk frequency about the segments are more important than broad industry discussions. And the most competitive, and this is across a lot of product lines, but it's always more competitive when you're dealing with bigger sophisticated companies. You have more people paying attention to it, they've got consultants. They're spreadsheet-ing [ph]. As you go down market, it's still competitive but not -- I don't think to the same level it is, particularly in the jumbo group size, the very large companies. So as people talk, Joanne, and you listen to them, it's really more segment specific.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","I just have one follow-up on a completely different subject. You've had some success with the indexed UL, I believe, and the variable UL. Have you done anything there to kind of enhance the product? I understand that strong equity markets has been a factor behind the kind of revival in sales in the industry overall. But have you done anything to tweak the product to make it a little bit more attractive?","Dennis R. Glass","We're constantly tweaking products to make them more attractive, and so there's a continuation of that, but nothing dramatic on variable universal life. But I will come back to my point, that having a broad based, strong, smart distribution capability enables you to talk to customers and partners about different products and why they might work and it's that rightful focus on these pivot products, and the distribution to be able to do that, that is going to help.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman with UBS.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess first, Dennis, you talked about the pivot strategy and of course now you're selling UL, VUL, indexed UL. What return are you generating on that business and what's the return on the secondary guarantee legacy UL? The legacy secondary guarantee UL?","Dennis R. Glass","You're breaking up a little bit on us, Andrew. But I think, if I heard the question, what's the different new business returns on the pivot portfolio and what are the current returns on SGUL. The pivot portfolio is -- there are typical 12% to 14% type of new business returns in the products that we're selling, we're getting that on. The SGUL products continue to be below our targeted objectives. We think, this year in the aggregate, on the business we expect to sell, that we can do better -- and we hope to do better than 10%. But that depends on us being able to make this pivot to the extent that we have it in our plans. And so far so good, we're gaining traction and moving in the right direction.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then the second question would be, just going back to the capital, and I'm thinking to investor day and you kind of had given guidelines of GDP and, well, this is growth of 2% unemployment at 9%, housing down 3%, S&P 11.75%. You have a capital margin of 1.5% and then, as you're alluding to on this quarter with free cash flow around $400 million, you could deploy that any which way you want. And now with, Randy, I think I'm hearing this right, Randy, you're saying that you could do a few securitizations that might do a couple of hundred million. I want to get a sense of how excited you -- I mean, Dennis, you mentioned earlier that the valuation seems low. I would absolutely agree. I mean, what's your appetite? I mean, do want to go beyond $400 million this year? And are you seeing a lot of M&A opportunities? Is there a big pipeline out there? Just let me get a feel, some color around those things.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. As I said here Andrew, as we sit here today, I fully expect to go beyond $400 million for the year. And once again, I'm going to go back and link this to sort of how we did this last year. We came into the year with the same $400 million guidance, did some additional reserve financing transactions, sold a couple of corporate assets, ended up a total of $800 billion of capital management last year. It's the same sort of approach this year. We come in with that guidance around $400 million, and as I said last quarter, I love to under-promise and over-deliver on these things. And we're going to do everything we can to over-deliver on capital management again. The key levers that we've got, the positive impact we are getting from reduced SGUL sales; as Dennis mentioned, about $1 of capital generation for $1 of lower sales, there's one; and then, incremental reserve financing transactions that we can do. It's a good robust market for reserved financing transactions. We still have some capacity on our balance sheet, so we're going to go -- the team is going to go do their level best to execute another one of those. We believe we're undervalued, Dennis mentioned it, I mentioned it, and we're not -- definitely not shy about buying back our own stock.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just the deal pipeline. Is there a lot out there on the other end of the spectrum?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, I think we're all aware of the companies that have exited the business and announced sales, Andrew. And as compared to 2010 and 2011, 2 companies is more than there has been in those 2 periods other than what, true and Met [ph], others did overseas. My guess is that, over the next 24 months of that, there will be companies refocusing on core businesses and maybe a little bit more M&A activity. But we're not building our growth plans which -- and we think we can develop, even in this interest rate environment as we said, very attractive organic growth through the combination of our franchise strength and capital management. So if something comes along that makes sense, great, but we're delivering results to our shareholders just based on our organic strategies, as we typically do.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. In Retirement Plans, can you update us on where Lincoln stands with respect to the new disclosure requirements? And I guess, around that, are you seeing any impact, in terms of sales opportunities where either being in compliance or not, those new requirements is having an impact on your competitiveness?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Let me start by saying that we've already put into place all of the sponsor disclosure that is being required. And so that's done and in the market. I guess, it's an important question, but I come back to what we believe is that, ultimately, it's our value proposition and delivery model that's critical to the success of this business and is going to drive the results. We're a mid-priced provider with a unique high-touch service model. We feel good about how we're positioned. Is there some temporary dislocation in the industry because of this disclosure? Who knows. But all of us in the industry aren't worried about that as much as we are delivering good value to the consumers.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate those comments. It was my understanding that there's maybe a couple of sizable competitors who aren't quite there yet in meeting those new requirements and that may be providing an opportunity at the margin for some of those who've gotten there quicker.","Dennis R. Glass","Your guess is as good as mine on that.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just secondly, just a quick update. Randy, good commentary and good outlook on the spread expectations as we move forward. Can you just update us on where you stand, I guess at the end of the first quarter, on crediting rates in your various businesses versus the minimums?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. We'll go business by business. Not an issue for the Group business. Or in the Annuity business, we're in very good shape. As I mentioned. I really don't see any pressure on economic spreads in the Annuity business. Significant amount of mobility to continue to manage the creditor rate in response to any declines in the earned rate. On the Life and the Retirement side, we're down to low to mid-single digits, 3 or 5 basis points of room. Even though, on the Retirement side, we continue to generate additional capacity as we sell these new products at lower guaranteed rates. So Life side, we're down to a few basis points. I don't see much additional rate cutting coming from the Life business. We made a pretty significant rate cut in the first quarter and that will sustain us, obviously, for a period of time here. I don't see any large cuts coming out of the Life side as we move forward. So that's why I guide sort of that 10 to 15 basis points of compression, which is similar to what I've guided to on the Retirement business.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the Retirement side. I heard your comment that the new business has minimums in the 1% to 1.5% range. Where's the crediting rate that you're going out to the market with relative to those minimums recently, I guess?","Dennis R. Glass","We're checking our facts on that right now. It's kind of a case-by-case situation. But low single-digit, for sure. Could I amplify on this appropriate focus that everyone has on interest margin compression? And obviously, for a company like Lincoln, and many other companies in the industry, lower rates affect earnings growth. But let me just add to that. This management team doesn't feel like they're a victim of low interest rates. We don't have any additional levers to sort of mitigate the impact of that. So on top of everything else you heard us talk about this morning, we are doing a couple of other things and let me identify them. The first one is that, after 3 years of investing in mostly investment grade bonds and mortgages, we have some leeway to take incremental investment risk to boost yield. It's not something that we are going to do in large amounts and it would develop over the same time frame that we are seeing compression from lower bond rates. So that will help mitigate this issue. And we also have initiatives underway to lower our core expenses. I think, over time, these 2 things alone on top of everything else that we're talking about, will help dent some of the impact on low interest rates. So I just want to signal to -- not signal, but explain to all of you, that we keep providing these $50-million-a-year numbers, which are accurate with respect to if interest rates stay at these levels. That's the right number Randy?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, that's the right number.","Dennis R. Glass","That's the right number. But we're taking other actions on top of all the investment to try to put a dent in that over the next 2 to 3 years.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, when we go out with that guidance, $50 million a year and growing by about $50 million a year after that, and we talked about that over a 3-year period. That is the worst-case scenario. It does not assume sort of management actions that we have taken and will continue to make as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger with Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","First, could you just give an update on the assets and liabilities held at the VA captive?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, we ended the quarter with assets in excess of liabilities -- in excess of $400 million. And once again, just to remind everyone, those are real assets generated by our hedge program. Now the liability itself came down pretty significantly during the quarter, obviously, with the strong equity markets, we saw the liability come down into the end of the quarter just over $1 billion. So over $400 million of assets in excess of our liabilities with a liability that's a little over $1 billion right now.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Alright, great. And then commission rates, I believe were reduced in March, on the MoneyGuard product. I was wondering if we should expect a material impact on MoneyGuard sales going forward from that.","Dennis R. Glass","We don't.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, so you think 1Q MoneyGuard sales are a pretty good run rate?","Dennis R. Glass","We don't give predictions but we continue to expect good growth in the MoneyGuard business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","You pre-funded some debt maturing later in the year. I guess the question is are we done de-leveraging?","Dennis R. Glass","No. I wouldn't say we're done, Mark. I mean, I think there is benefit to taking leverage out of the balance sheet, also, for companies such as ourself. We feel very good about the leverage position we're at right now. But doing some amount of de-levering with our capital management, I think, is -- there's a lot of benefit to that. So what I said in the past, and what I continue to say is, we're definitely skewed toward buybacks at the moment. But some element of de-levering in our capital management, I wouldn't be surprised by. And we have other levers to do a little bit of de-levering here and there.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. But that actually would be beyond 2012, I assume.","Dennis R. Glass","Well, I'm not going to preclude anything in 2012 either. There still could be some element of that. If not, some major component of capital management. But could we do some something on the edge? We have flexibility to do that sort of thing.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just coming back to the Life business and UL sales. I know, you don't want to give predictions. But I guess the question is, is there anything that you're seeing, in terms of the other competitor behavior or pricing change, that would give you an indication that the current run rate of sales, somewhere in the $45 million to $50 million range, is or isn't a reasonable, trendable number for the rest of the year?","Dennis R. Glass","Again, we don't give predictions. And I apologize for repeating this again, to everyone. But end of the year results are going to depend on 2 things, total sales for the year. One is what else do competitors do and we can't do anything about that. But more importantly, what we can do is continue to execute on this pivot strategy and we think we can get it done. And so I would say the first quarter, that would not be our expected run rate for the year.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, on the VA business. You talked, again, about kind of this subaccount option in Volatility Management. I guess what I'm curious about is, as more money goes into this accounts, does it change? Does it improve the actual return objectives of it or does it really more just manage kind of the outcomes within a narrower band?","Dennis R. Glass","Are you speaking from the consumer's perspective?","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I'm talking about from Lincoln's perspective.","Dennis R. Glass","Let's start with the consumer. What this does to the consumer is creates a narrow volatility. So let's just use a number. If you were targeting a 7% return you might have swings of 30%, 40% around 7%, and the protected funds are trying to shrink that spread from 30% to 8%, 10%, 12%. And so that's just a volatility issue. Then there's the cost of putting that on [indiscernible] pieces of program. So the expected returns have to go down the by the amount of cost that we're charging to do that. Which is not that significant, maybe 50 to 100 basis points. So that's what's happening from the consumer side. From the Lincoln side, we have a mirror image of that. The pricing of a lot of our derivatives is dependent on the fluctuation of returns on the underlying subaccounts, to the extent you've dampened that, you've lower the cost of your hedge execution. Does that help?","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Dargan with Macquarie.","Sean Dargan - Macquarie Research","Just have a question about the larger VA market. You said you're comfortable with the dynamics now. But with the sort of -- one of the 800-pound gorillas dialing back, are you getting more, I guess pressure from your distribution outlets to give them more product or do you see this market shrinking as a whole going forward?","Dennis R. Glass","Let me separate sort of the practicalities of distribution and who's playing the market from the long-term trends associated with the business. I'll start with the latter first. There is no question that consumers are more interested in guarantees than they have been in the past. There's no question about this big demographic move with more people going into retirement. So those 2 things are going to build this market over time for everybody. In the short run, the dynamics with distributors are that if people leave the business, a company leaves the business, there's some adjustment time to that, it's not an automatic that, that business that they were doing, in the short run, is going to be absorbed by other companies. It is just who's been selling what, what programs are in place and had to be changed at the distribution partner level. And so there could be some industry-wide -- depending on the channel, I mean, in the wires [ph] for example, you can see some decline just because of the movement of providers. But that's short-term. And longer-term, this is a good business with good reason from a demographic and the expectation of consumers about what they want in their retirement.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over for closing remarks.","Dennis R.

And thank you for joining Lincoln Financial Group's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later, we will announce the opportunity for questions and instructions will be giving at that time. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Lauren. Good morning. And welcome to Lincoln Financial\u2019s third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln\u2019s website www.lincolnfinancial.com where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today\u2019s call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. This quarter was remarked by significant capital markets volatility, Lincoln's growth, profitability and capital management initiatives produced solid results. Top line metrics were very strong as we benefited from a number of new product introduction, as a result we generated positive net flows in all our segments which led to a 17% increase in consolidated net flows while life insurance sales also grew 8%. EPS excluding notable items in both periods increased 10% as we noted in the press release our annual plus function review reduced reported ESP [ph]. Never look back this was a non cash item and our balance sheet continues to be a stores up strength.","To this point our book value per share excluding AOCI increased 7% and buybacks accelerated to 200 million as capital generation remain solid. Bottom line our franchise earnings growth potential and balance sheet are all very strong. Equally important our quarterly result should mitigate several recent areas of investor uncertainty. Notably individual life mortality returned to the normal levels following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. Annuity earnings proved be resilient despite market volatility and group protection produced stable results as we continue our past to a forward recovery in earnings.","Now turning to our business lines starting with annuities. Total annuity sales of 3.3 billion were steady with our quarterly average part of the past year which is a testament to our consistent approach for market. We are focused on delivering and diversifying the mix of our annuity sales and there are couple examples in this quarter. First 27% of our VA sales did not have living benefits as we are well good and reach our strategic goal of 30%. Investor advantage our investment focus VA product remains an important contributor to this risk diversification strategy. Also in October we amended our variable annuity reinsurance treaty we now have an additional $2 billion of capacity through year in 2016 which provides another lever for diversification.","Next, fixed annuity sales approached 600 million more than doubled of prior year and up 55% sequentially as we broadened our index annuity portfolio and expanded relationships. Market volatility in August also likely contributed the style of growth although it dampened VA sales. This shift is just another example of the benefit of a diverse set of product offerings and meet different consumer needs. Subsequent to end of the quarter we introduced a new benefit again with the goal of diversifying our annuity portfolio and meeting different consumer preferences. Our recently launched market select advantage is a variable annuity rider designed offer greater investment flexibility in a living benefit without the guaranteed roll up traditionally offered with GMWB's.","Market select advantage is positioned to fill the gap between investment focused VA's and VA's with roll up living benefits. Net flows in the quarter totaled 536 million as we continued to consistently generate positive organic growth. And this marks the second straight quarter of sequential improvement. Positive net flows has more than offset unfavorable equity fund performance as average account balances increased versus the prior period to 123 billion. Our annuity business remains a high quality source of earnings. This was attributable to decisions we made over a decade ago when we entered the living benefit marketplace. Mainly fully hedging capital market risks and not participating in competitor feature awards, as a result we have produced a long track record of success. I would encourage you all to look at our presentation in Barclay's financial conference last month. In that we reviewed our extended record of positive net flows and e-growth [ph] that compares favorably to asset managers, when combined with effective risk management and a movement to a lower risk profile, I continue to believe this business is very under appreciated.","Turning to individual life, total life insurance sales in the quarter were $173, an 8% increase from the prior year quarter, while individual life insurance sales increased 5%. Overall sales once again achieved our expected per rate returns of 12% to 15%. Digging into a few noteworthy product stories MoneyGuard sales increased 21% as we are benefiting from continued market acceptance of our MoneyGuard II product and traction in recently approved sales. ","Indexed Universal Life sales increased 17% due to the success of new product launches. Momentum should continue as new regulations that began in September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates as a result, our market position should improve, product portfolio diversification continues to be a strategic focus within our life business as well. This quarter no single product represented more than 30% of our total production and 67% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees up from 63% in the prior year quarter. Overall, key business drivers indicate mid-single digit earnings growth potential for our life insurance business consistent with our expectations.","Turning to Group Protection, we are pleased with the continued progress we're making with our re-pricing efforts and the improvements of our claims management effectiveness. Overall earnings increased from depressed results in the prior year quarter and we're consistent with the second quarter as we work towards achieving our targeted margins.","Third quarter sales $61 million were down as our pricing actions continue to put pressure on new business opportunities. Despite this pressure, we're pleased with our continued progress to improve the contribution of the more profitable employee head, voluntary market. In the quarter 49% of our sales were employee paid, up from 45% in the prior year quarter. ","It is worth noting, we do see momentum building in our sales pipeline going into the fourth quarter, which is important as this quarter typically contributes about 50% of full year sales. In retirement planned services, third quarter deposits of $1.9 billion were up 17% from a year ago and it included growth in both the small and mid-to-large market. First year sales increased 65% as our investments in our sales force and technology continued to gain momentum.","Net flows of 251 million marked to third consecutive quarter of positive net flows and increased our year to date totals to $673 million compared to just $55 million in the prior year.","The fourth quarter is when we typically see large case movement. To this point, we were recently notified the case termination, as a result we expect to have negative flows in fourth quarter, however our annual net flows will be positive and marked a significant improvement from last year. Bottom line our pipeline remains robust and we're confident our growth can outpace the market as our strategic investments improve our infrastructure and deepen our relationships and value proposition with consultants, plan sponsors and participants.","In distribution, we differentiate ourselves in marketplace through our retail, wholesale and worksite teams that once again delivered exceptional results. Strong sales growth noted in many products within the business section has been on our terms and importantly aligns with our business mix shift.","Our 1,400 client facing professionals and base of 91,000 producers has sold Lincoln products over the past two years continued to be a strategic advantage.","We remain focused on increasing productivity of this sales force and to this point, sales driven by distributors where we have multiple products on their platforms increase sequentially in key cross-sell areas, such as RPS, MoneyGuard and fixed annuities. In the quarter Lincoln Financial National network produced year-over-year sales growth across life annuities and RPS as the retail advisor network of 8,300 delivered our valuable customer solutions. We\u2019ll continue to invest in already deepen and powerful distribution to drive future growth and pivot to products that clients need and that Lincoln is uniquely positioned to offer.","Lastly, on investment management, we put new money to work in the third quarter at an average yield of 4.4% about 10 basis points above the prior quarter. We benefitted from higher average treasure rates and wider spread. The investment portfolio quality remains strong with investment grade assets representing just 5% of our fixed maturity portfolio down slightly from the prior year.","Our alternatives portfolio was a strong contributor to investment income in the quarter, alternatives now represents 1.3% of our total invested assets and has steadily grown towards our long-term target of 1.5%. As we expand this portfolio, we expect to drive further growth in alternative investment income. In closing underlying EPS growth of 10% is consistent with the target we provided at our investment -- Investor Day last year driven by organic earning, modest capital tailwinds and effective capital management. We remain confident in our ability to drive earnings growth as we leveraged attractive growth opportunities, enforce margin improvement and our strong balance sheet which supports our active capital allocation.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of 289 million, or a $1.11 per share for the third quarter. As Dennis noted, excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year as this quarter was negatively impacted by $0.55, primarily from our annual review of debt consumptions. While last year\u2019s third quarter benefited $0.05 largely from the annual review.","This year's DAC assumption review results were driven by $121 million negative impact from lowering our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points. A couple of important items to note, this is a non-cash charge and the impact was consistent with the sensitivity we previously provided, recall we last lowered this assumption three years ago also by 50 basis points. Outside of changing our long-term earned rate assumptions there were a series of pluses and minuses that meted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of 7 million.","A few comments on this year\u2019s review process. With the 50 basis point reduction in our long-term earned rate we are very well positioned with this particular assumption. Our ultimate earned rate now assumes only modest annual increases from today\u2019s level, increases that are largely in line with the forward curve and significantly below the rate implied by the Federal Reserve\u2019s own expectation.","In conjunction with the 50 basis point reduction and our long-term earned rate, we lowered our separate account return assumption by a similar amount. I will discuss this in more detail in the annuity section of my remarks. Every year we go through this extensive review of all of the assumptions underlying our debt balances and we consistently have come back with the same results that is that when viewed in total the assumptions underlying our balance sheet are sound. In fact over the past five years the cumulative impact has been just 0.3% of our equity. During the same period of time our book value per share excluding AOCI has grown by approximately 40, including 7% this year to $51.47, an all-time high.","Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all which normalized for notable items. The top-line continues to show growth with operating revenues up 2% driven by another quarter of positive net flows. Our forward segment showed year-over-year growth in earnings, operating return on equity came in at 13.5% and finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength providing a significant financial flexibility and an ability opportunistically respond to marketplace dislocations. One other item of note before shifting to segment results and that is investment, again this quarter was strong with alternative running 11 million after tax and DAC ahead of our targeted returns. Prepayment related investment income remains elevated but was right in line with our quarterly average of the past three years.","Now to business results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were 259 million, a 6% increase over last year. Net favorable items this quarter totaled 5 million, primarily related to taxes with 1 million of the total coming from the net impact of our DAC assumption review. As I noted earlier we did lower our separate account return assumption which is an important input inside annuities DAC models. This reduction brought our return assumption down to 7.6% compared to 8.2% last year. We did not unlock our reversion for the main corridor, this currently still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. ","Return metrics remained strong and consistent with recent periods. ROA increased 3 basis points versus the prior year while ROE came in at 24%, again an outstanding result. So overall our annuity business continues to generate organic growth and excellent returns. The financial impact of changes to assumptions that underlie the earnings and valuation of the business was minimal and are a testament to this being a well-managed and strong high quality source of earnings. ","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Our annual assumption review had the greatest impact on life operations as reported earnings was 36 million. $118 million of the $121 million earnings impact I noted upfront from lowering our long-term merger rate assumption sell within the life's business. We now assume an ultimate rate of 5.25%, down from 5.75%. All the other items that went into the unlocking process resulted in a benefit to earnings of 1 million. Excluding notable items earnings increased 2% over the prior year quarter and notably mortality returned to normal levels following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. We continue to expect mortality to perform in line with pricing as we look forward. Normalized spreads came in at 165 basis points down 1 basis points from the prior year. ","Quickly on life earnings drivers. Average account values increased 4% with total in-force base amount of 3%, consistent with recent performance in our mid-single digit organic growth expectations. In the group protection segment earnings were 17 million more than double the prior year quarter and were consistent with the second quarter. Our non-medical loss ratio improved to 74.5% from 77.6% in the prior year quarter driven by improvement in all product lines life, disability and dental. ","A disability loss ratio did increase sequentially which I would attribute to normal quarter-to-quarter volatility. Of price inactions continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency in sales. The result is non-medical earned premiums decreased 1% compared to the prior year quarter. Overall, I believe we have another quarter that validates that we are on a pass to an earnings recovery in group protection. In retirement planned services we reported earnings of $42 million compared to $40 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings benefited by $2 million from the annual review of modeled assumptions. Earnings benefited this quarter from strong investment results including alternative in prepayment income while normalized spreads compressed 10 basis points versus the prior year quarter at the low end of our expectations. ","Account values have benefitted from several quarters of positive net flows, when combined with modest negative changes in equity markets over the past year average account values increased 1% to $54 billion. Year-to-date our ROA is 26 basis points, a level I expects to be a good proxy in the intermediate term as we continue to make investments in the business to position us well to future growth. ","Before I move into Q&A let me comment on capital. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of returning cash to shareholders. This quarter we repurchase 200 million of Lincoln shares as we reacted to some weakness in the share price resulting in incremental buyback below book value.","Year-to-date we have repurchased $700 million of stock which is consistent with our full year guidance. With that said we expect to remain active in the fourth quarter. We also announced a 25% increase in our shareholder dividend as we have noted in the past we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. As you can see by this quarter's results and more importantly over an extended period of time capital allocation remains a key priority for Lincoln. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $505 million and statutory surplus stands at 8.3 billion, while we estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 495%. ","So to conclude statutory and GAAP balance sheets are both in very solid positions as evidenced by strong RBC and holding company cash positions and our annual assumption review did not compromise steady growth and book value per share ex-AOCI. Organic growth drivers are firmly intact with another quarter of positive net flows across the enterprise. Mortality returned to normal level following elevated experience earlier in the year. Annuity earnings remained a high quality source of income and proved to be resilient by market volatility and we took advantage of weakness in the share price with incremental buyback of the lower booked value. ","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Your line is open. ","Suneet Kamath","I wanted to start with the Department of Labor issue. I realize that they're still in deliberations in terms of the final proposal but I was wondering, Dennis, if you could give us a sense of how conversations are going with some of your distribution partners related to scenarios for potential outcomes? I guess there's been some talk in the press about your annuity sales maybe being cut in half for some period of time, if the proposal passes as originally proposed. So I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about either relationship with your distribution partners and the outlook for VAs? Thanks.","Dennis Glass","Suneet, let me speak to the DOL and the specific issue of having a reasonable regulation to permit the sales of variable annuities on a commission basis into IRAs. That's the biggest area that -- it's the area of focus for Lincoln and the area that we\u2019ve tried and have successfully gotten a correlation of annuity manufacturers to focus on. On that issue, we continue -- I'm not updating anything from what I've said in the past, but we continue to feel optimistic based on discussions -- direct discussions with DOL staff, that they are giving consideration to permit this to occur.","So on that's specification issue we remain pretty optimistic and if that were to happen, I think the idea of VA sales being cut by 50% for IRAs over the qualified market would be way overshot, so that's that. With respect to our other distributors, we keep repeating, we have a large number of distributors, every one of those distributors is looking at DOL, if it impacts them and trying to anticipate for the rules were or might be and what reaction they might have to take. So we're in discussions with them, we are aware of the issues, we are developing backup plans, some of our distributors modestly changed their business models and that's as much as we know today.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, I guess one for Randy. On the Alternative investment income, I was a little surprised that it was so strong in the quarter just given the choppy capital markets. Can you give us a sense of, one, where the strength came from and then two, is there any kind of lag that we need to think about in terms of how this alternative investment income actually flows through? ","Randy Freitag","Well, thanks for the question. It was a strong quarter for alternatives as I mentioned, it was 11 million after tax and DAC above expectations. When you view it over a longer term, if you look at for instance the full-year, this year, we're actually right on top of our expectations of a 10% yield to that portfolio and that's by and large the case over the last couple of years also, so I don't think of the performance of the alternatives over an extended period of time of being out of bounds with our expectations, in terms of where that performance came this year, I think consistent with what you have in alternatives, it's oftentimes depends on where you're positioned, are you in the hedge fund that didn't too bad or didn't too good, are you in PE that has a particularly good quarter?","I think we experienced that this quarter, we had upper tick PEs that just had good quarters and they had valuation events which led to strong evaluations which led to the strong results. In terms of predicting the future, I\u2019m going to stay out of that game, I will stick to what I say and when I say, that over an extended period of time, we'll expect to see and I think we'll see a 10% return from out of this book of business, predicting what you're going to have in any particular quarter is difficult to gain that -- I will choose not to endeavor in it.","Suneet Kamath","I understood, I was more asking about if third quarter results are a true reflection of the capital markets environment in the third quarter or was there a little bit of a spillover from the second quarter because of some sort of a lag in terms of how alternatives are reported to you?","Randy Freitag","I think third quarter was reflective of what you see in this business, it's a small piece of the portfolio, it\u2019s a limited number holding. This quarter we had some of those that really performed strong and that's what you\u2019re going to have, so you get some pieces of that didn't perform so well but we have a certain number of pieces that really performed stronger, and that's what you are going to see in this sort of business. With that over time you will continue to see the result in this business perform in line with our expectations.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jefferies. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Really a question about the mix of Annuity sales. And I'm sorry if, Dennis, you addressed it in your prepared remarks because I hopped on just a little bit late. I was curious about the year-over-year and the quarter-over-quarter decline in variable Annuity sales but obviously a very significant pickup in the pace of what you characterized as fixed annuities. I'm sure it was more driven by or I'm suspecting it's more driven by index. Whether you believe that that's an indication of distributors shifting in response to DOL or whether you think that was really much more about just shifting preferences during a period of heightened market volatility?","Dennis Glass","We think it more of the later, we think in general whether it\u2019s BA or its mutual fund, spikes in volatility kill sales of those products and consumers get more conservative. We think that\u2019s by BA sales were dampened a little bit against volatility, it\u2019s also why we think in a part indexed annuities picked up a little share. What we continue to point to is that we have the shelf space and the products to be able to sell as consumer preferences shift. And this is a good example of that. We\u2019re continuing to focus throughout the businesses improving products, adding a better distribution, well improving products from a return standpoint by having greater diversification and breath of product. So we can be successful as consumer preferences and market condition change. So its answer to the first part, is there a hint of the DOL in these sales, it is hard to say.","John Nadel","Okay","Dennis Glass","It's hard to say.","John Nadel","And then sort of along those same lines, if you could choose to -- the next $1 billion of annuity sales manufactured by Lincoln and I gave you the choice between its 100% variable annuities or 100% indexed annuities, what's your choice?","Dennis Glass","Surely what the consumer's choice is more than my choice?","John Nadel","I get that. It's a hypothetical. But I'm more interested around capital allocation, return potential, mix of business, that sort of thing.","Dennis Glass","Then I\u2019ll just fall back on our guidance on strategy in terms of mix. We are very comfortable with 78% of our sales going into BA products that\u2019s have one or the other degree of living benefits. I mentioned we offered a product or just started offering the product, has a little bit more investment flexibility but a little bit less income because we don\u2019t have roll up in it and I think that is a pretty good addition to the portfolio -- BA portfolio that we have inside that 78% guarantee, it diversifies risk as the little bit, and it also helps in the market place, all the financial advisors be it little bit more crisp for their clients in discussing investment only, no guarantee of products, products with a stronger guarantee and now a middle of the road products. So we think that\u2019s a pretty good addition, I still think the two ends of that spectrum are going to see the most attraction, but we do expect that middle segment to get good sales.","Let me just finish up, so that\u2019s VA on the fixed annuity side just part of the 30% and we're comfortable with that, I think the returns are a little bit less then what we\u2019ve seen on the variable annuities. So we want manage that mix a little bit.","John Nadel","Okay. Got it. And then just one quick follow-up also related to the VA block and that is, obviously we saw a period of very heightened market volatility. I'm just curious how you feel about how the self-hedging or the internal hedging, I forget the exact term, funds performed this quarter and how you can relate that to -- I know your overall hedge program had a little bit more breakage than I think is typical -- to the volatility managed fund? Thank you.","Dennis Glass","Let me speak, the risk managed funds in general across the industry whether it's in the mutual fund business or in VA business, did it perform as well in this period of heightened volatility. So there was couple of questions about risk management funds performance across all industries, not just the VA industry. Overtime these are designed with a long-term to provide a smoother path of returns for the consumers and we think that\u2019s a good thing. So I wouldn\u2019t react too much for the fact in a sixty day period, they didn\u2019t perform as well. And randy you want to speak too?","Randy Freitag","Sure John, on the hedge program performance, there was more breakage this quarter than we have been experienced or that we typically inexperience in the quarter. Couple of comments, it was a quarter with significant amount of volatility in the capital markets to scale that, I think over half the days you saw intraday movements of greater than 1%. When you have that you're going to have some level of breakage and you also -- what you see when you have those sorts of days as you also actually have your trading costs go up which sort of manifests itself as breakage also, as you just trading a lot, as you're chasing the liability around. So I am not surprised in a quarter with that sort of volatility to have some level of breakage.","I think what exacerbated it little bit this quarter is the fact that we had our funds underperform in their indexes also. I\u2019ll just remind you the fund basis risk is what you call overtime if you look at the last decade that\u2019s a number that summed up essentially to zero for us. So you know that\u2019s the number that can come and go, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that come back at some point in time. But it's when you get both those sort of items, a very volatile quarter on the capital markets, you combine it with that fund basis risk and you have a quarter like we did this quarter with a little more breakage. I would point out when viewed over more extended period of time, I think last time I looked at this I looked at it over the last six years breakage and the hedge program was a 1% to 2% impact on the overall ROE.","I think the whole overall ROE over that period was 22% and if you included the below the line items it was just 1% to 2% reduction from that, so still very, very confident in performance in the hedge program over more extended period of time, but understand that this quarter did have a little more breakage than usual.","John Nadel","Okay, understand. Thank you so much for the color and the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher ","Randy, wanted to start with the lowering of the long-term separate account return assumptions down to 7.6. Can you take us underneath the covers a little bit, explain how that affected the balance sheet review? You didn't have any charge associated with that. What would have been some of the offsetting adjustments?","Randy Freitag","Sure, well it's primarily an item, essentially all the impact shows up in the annuity business. You get a little bit in the life business and a real little bit in the RPS business. It's primarily an item that impacts the annuity business. Really the driver of the reduction, Tom, I would really point to what drove us to lower our ultimate earned rate assumption, essentially a reflection that risk free rates are going to be a little lower when you look forward and that said through to our thoughts on what overall capital markets returns would be. So as I mentioned we ended up lowering the separate account return assumption by a similar amount to what we lowered that J-curve assumption.","In terms of the impact as I mentioned is primarily in the Annuity business. It was definitely a negative item, not going to get into sizing of the dollar amount, but it was definitely negative, it was offset inside of annuities by all the other assumptions that go into the process, lapses, fee income, all those other items that go into the process add it up to be a positive number that offsets the negative number that was caused by lowering the separate account return assumption.","Tom Gallagher ","Okay. And then what's the size of the reversion to mean equity cushion as of the end of this quarter?","Randy Freitag","In total it\u2019s in the range of $165 million, 130 million of that in the annuity business with small pieces in life and RPS.","Tom Gallagher ","Got you. And then Randy, after making that change, any impact on earnings? I presume there's going to be some change in DAC amortization after you change the separate account return assumptions. But should we think about any go-forward operating earnings impact that's meaningful at all?","Randy Freitag","Tom both the J-curve and the separate account return assumption have modest negative impacts on run rate earnings, it's not a number I\u2019m going to spike out and say that, I would see significant changes to your models. Both of them have modest negative impacts on run rate.","Tom Gallagher ","Okay. And then last question. Just in lieu of what's happened in the Life business including the adjustment this quarter, any impact on goodwill testing that we should think about for next quarter or is there still enough margin there?","Randy Freitag","Yes and once again you know we do this analysis in the fourth quarter, so I\u2019m not going to get ahead of all that analysis and I am going to look to the items I have talked about in the past when it comes to goodwill testing. The big drivers, first off we have two business that have typically gone to step two of a goodwill analysis, Life Insurance and Group Protection. The big drivers of goodwill for those businesses are the level of sales, the profitability on those sales, the discount rates you apply to those sales. When you look at those three metrics, I think they continue to run strong.","Life sales continue to grow, group sales while down are still very strong relative to the size of that book to business, profitability on life sales remain strong, profitability on group business we\u2019ve talked about remains strong and discount rates are nowhere but down compared to where they were in past year. So the big three items that I think about, when I'm open to think about what might be coming on good will, seemed to be pointed in a favorable direction, so we\u2019ll go ahead and do the analysis in the fourth quarter. ","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one last one on, I saw the RBC $495 million still pretty strong despite the pickup in buybacks. How about if you looked at consolidated capitalization of the Company, any meaningful changes to Hodlco cash during the quarter?","Randy Freitag","Hodlco cash came down a little bit, I think it came down from maybe in the 540 to the 505 range, so it came down a little bit, but it still in excess of our targeted amount 500 million, it\u2019s very comfortable there. Overall RBC at 495 as you mentioned remains very strong and very supportive of continued capital deployment as you\u2019ve seen in the past.","Operator","Our next question comes from Seth Weiss from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Seth Weiss","Randy, last quarter I think you commented on expectations to perhaps do a reserve financing transaction in the back half of the year. Could you just provide an update on that, please?","Randy Freitag","Yes, so thanks for the question. We do expect to do a reserve financing transaction in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s around term business that we've written over the last couple of years, so I\u2019d expect to see that come to as a positive item on capital in the fourth quarter.","Seth Weiss","Okay. And are you able to size that for us or too early to say?","Randy Freitag","In the range and we've typically talked about a couple of $100 million being fairly typical, in that area, maybe a little better but in that area.","Seth Weiss","Great. Thanks. And Dennis, if I could just return to the DOL topic for a moment. The comments today I think are pretty consistent with what you said at the industry conference last month in terms of DOL staff giving consideration to permit commissioned sales to occur. From what we're hearing here, our impression was that avenue was through the best interest contract which has obviously gotten pushback from the VA manufacturer community. So I'm just curious, when you say that your discussions have yielded this cautious optimism, are you hearing anything different when it comes to maybe a separate VA carve-out or inclusion in the 8424 exemption?","Dennis Glass","You've touched on the two big paths to the right answer, and if you look at the letter that was signed by eight or nine of these annuity companies of both -- our first choice would be to put VAs backs in 8424, the way 8424 exist. It was that way for 30 years, it was that way in 2010 initial proposal and it\u2019s only in this later proposal -- I think it was 2010 as knowing this later proposal what was moved into best interest contract exemption. But if remains -- I guess if I had to -- it\u2019s more uphill on 8424. But if it's in the best interest, contracting exemption has the be provided a framework for in our letters, I think they\u2019ll still give consideration to separating out annuities from mutual funds because it's just different. So that\u2019s more detailed to just go and take a look at our letter, it's pretty consistent with what I've just said.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Kovac","Great. Thanks. This is maybe for Dennis. You talked about the risked managed funds and I guess I was a little surprised that they underperformed in this period given I imagine that a consumer is really buying them to outperform exactly in the kind of market that we saw in the third quarter. As you spoke to, this is not really a Lincoln specific, but more of an industry issue. I guess I'm wondering what are your thoughts going forward on the consumer appetites for this kind of product, particularly in VA, if it is underperforming in a volatile and sort of a rising market as well.","Dennis Glass","I think that the -- I\u2019m going to speak very generally here, these overlays are intended to operate over a long period of time and they should perform well over a long period of time, all the back testing and that's done in the development of the products suggest that. I would characterize the last 90 days as unusual in the sense that you has so many V shaped patterns to the S&P market in such a short period of time, Randy addressed that in the discussion of the hedging program and why that volatility lead to some more breakage, similarly I discussed volatility just as a chilling effect on equity based product in general, mutual funds and VAs.","And the other point I would say is that even though the risk management overlay and the performance is improved a little bit by the way in the last 30 days again, this is industry wide. Remember that this is at the end of the spectrum of product design where people pay a lot of attention to the guarantee and the guarantee is working for them just as it should, the roll ups working, the payout down the road is still what the expectations are. So I think it would be hard to say based on 90 days, the consumers are cooling over the long-term or not again I think, you have to take control of the expectations by the consumer both in terms of fund performance as well as guarantee on these products, remember the only way you can get the high income guarantee in the industry with maybe one exception is through the use of risk managed funds, does that helpful?","Michael Kovac","Yes, that's helpful. And then if I could, one more on VA here? It sounded like you added an additional $2 billion to your reinsurance capacity for this product. What do you see as the appetite from reinsurers to this type of risk? Do you see more participants in the market or any changing terms that you got on this transaction versus prior?","Dennis Glass","Randy, could you take that please?","Randy Freitag","Yes, Michael the extension was with the same company that we have the reinsurer\u2019s treaty with previously. I would describe the overall environment is still relatively modest from the number of people who are -- I think you see a little more interest. I think the very fact that the company we did our deal with, did the deal, raised some interest and has caused some people to look at it. But I don't think it\u2019s the huge number of participants you get out there in the marketplace. We'll continue to work, I think, we obviously have a lot of connections anybody who would be interested in doing reinsurance is naturally going to be in discussion with us and we'll continue those sorts of discussions, but I wouldn't describe the marketplace as robust. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ","Jimmy Bhullar","So Randy, I had a question on just your repricing of the disability book. If you could describe how much you're done or will be done by the end of this year and what's the environment like in terms of clients absorbing price hikes? Your sales I think this quarter were down 35%. As we look at year-end renewing cycles, should we expect a similar decline in sales and then obviously weaker revenues next year?","Randy Freitag","I think, I will take that. At the highest, so we start at the high level answer to that question. About 78% of the business that we have to reprice because it was poorly priced a couple of years ago --the business that was poorly priced a couple of years ago, we're about 78% of the way through and so we have a little bit more to do, but a good example by the way on that business is year-to-date on the premium that we retain we\u2019ve gotten really high middle single digit improvements in margins, our pricing activities are proving out to be successful and that earnings will flow into the income statement over time. As I mentioned in my remarks, the pipeline of sales is above and that's a good indicator of premium growth or sales momentum. With respect to the retention rate of business as we go through the next 60 to 90 days of re-pricing based on what we're doing, we would think the retention might be a little bit better than 60%, but will have to see.","Jimmy Bhullar","And then on the legal loss, you've had higher legal expenses for the past couple of quarters. I think partly this is related to your Life Insurance business but to what extent do you expect them to sustain or are the issues behind you now?","Randy Freitag","We have a pretty good review of aggregate litigation issues in our SEC filings and so I'm not going to get into very specific answer to this question, I\u2019ve watched this over the last decade, litigation, ebbs and flows for all companies, insurance companies, financial services companies as well, I think there is no exceptional to that, sort of the aggregate amount of cases that you have and the severity of those cases at any one point in time ebb and flow, we\u2019ll continue to see that. I do not expect that particularly this quarter would be any indication of a normal level of legal expense ","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up for Randy. I know you mentioned that mortality was in line but can you give us any more detail on either actual-to-expected mortality or another metric that you look at and maybe how it compared to the year ago quarter?","Randy Freitag","Yes, I think compared to the year ago quarter, I described both quarters as in line with our expectations. So our expectations are for a number that typically travels in the 80% and we\u2019re right in that range. So I don\u2019t think there was anything abnormal about either quarter. Of course the first-half there we had elevated experience, I would have loved to see it coming below expectations, but it doesn\u2019t, it came in sort of right in line with our expectations, very similar to where we were last year in the third quarter.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thanks. And then in the annuity business, the normalized ROA was 83 basis points which was up a bit from the second quarter despite the weaker market. Do you think that the 83 basis points is a good run rate going forward or should we be thinking about anything else there?","Randy Freitag","As we mentioned, I think both Dennis and I mentioned we're very happy with the resilience of annuity results despite the drag of the markets. In terms of what we would expect, I mentioned that the business had 5 million of items primarily favorable tax item little bit 1 million or so from the unlocking process. We also mentioned that Alternative Investment income added 11 million across the enterprise most of that was in Life, but annuity got a little bit of it, couple of million and then the prepayment income. If you look at last quarter prepayment income was actually very low, whereas this quarter it was strong. Which is sort of reflective of the nature of prepayment income. Quarter-to-quarter is going to hop around, but over the last three years if you look over a calendar year period, it\u2019s been very very steady in the amounts that we\u2019ve received, in fact was very similar to the amount we received this quarter.","So I think the fact that it hopped up had to do with, one, first and foremost the resilient for the business and secondly, strong performance in the investment portfolio.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then just last one real quick. Do you have an update on the assets and liabilities in the VA assets?","Randy Freitag","They continue to run very strong, so assets exceed the hedge target by $1.4 billion I believe at the end of the quarter, so it's still a very comfortable margin and they also exceed the statutory reserve credit by a significant amount $800 million, $900 million, in excess of statutory reserve credit needed. So in a very good position on assets, of course they had hedge performance in the quarter, heard that little bit, but once again look at hedge performance over an expanded period of time, I wouldn\u2019t expect to see this sort of quarter repeated.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar ","Hi, good morning. All my questions have been answered. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee ","Just have a question about the latest NAIC proposal about eliminating -- potentially eliminating the use of VA captives. Any color or comments from the proposal?","Randy Freitag","Yes, the -- let me explain what the problem is to begin with, and that is that statutory accounting is on a book value basis and hedging typically is on an economic basis and in entail situations those two things can different. And so it could create some temporary capital calls and severe capital market conditions. I think the regulators understand the idea that a regulated company having prepared against one risk and because of it\u2019s the exact opposite of the other risk, not being able to protect that other risk is not in good regulatory situation. So the industry and the regulators are striving to achieve a regulatory framework that permits all of us to probably hedge the risk that we undertake.","The NAIC is hired Oliver Wyman as a consultant, Oliver Wyman has put out his first report and although much needs to be -- there is a lot of detailing into it, the initial report seems to get at solving this problem. So at this point we\u2019re encouraged, there is a long way to go and Lincoln is active as we typically are in working with regulators on this issue. But I met regularly with the regulators. I think there's a pretty good sense of let's get to a good answer for the regulators and let's get a good answer for the industry.","Humphrey Lee ","I think at least from my understanding there will be some -- obviously some positives and negatives and to the extent that the capital requirement may turn out to be lower or maybe more on an economic base as opposed to a prescribed model and at the same time you may get some benefits from better ignition of the attached assets. So those would potentially to provide some offsets if there's some challenges to the use of captives. Would that be a fair statement?","Dennis Glass","You said a lot of -- you gave us a lot of issues in there and I\u2019ll just fall back to, the issue is to get a regulation that makes sense with the industry and to the regulators, again the situation now in book value versus economic creating a problem, we are making progress on that issue and some of the things that you've mentioned are helpful on that specific issues, some of them I wasn\u2019t quite sure of where they are in discussions right now, but again overall it's positive and we\u2019re all regulators and the industry is hopeful that we can get to a solution that makes sense for everyone.","Humphrey Lee","Thanks. And then just one last question for Randy. So you talked about fourth quarter in terms of buybacks will remain active and then you also mentioned about the potential reserve financing in the fourth quarter. Should we think about the buyback were largely driven by reserve financing or do you still have some kind of free cash flow generation capacity that would add onto the reserve financing?","Randy Freitag","When you think about overall buybacks we\u2019re 700 million year-to-date, so that's over tax full year guidance, we came into the year and that\u2019s reflective of a number of things including strong capital generation, continued strong performance from the company. When you look to the fourth quarters specifically I think I would describe my expectations coming in the quarter as sort of as a normal quarter, alright. We've been running in that 150 range on the 2,550 range, so I don\u2019t go into the quarter with any expectations for anything outside, but we continue to have a very strong balance sheet and we continue to have the capability to step in when we see dislocations in the marketplace as we did in the third quarter when we stepped in and hopped the buyback amount, when we saw the share price dip below book value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz","A couple of quickies. Dennis, you mentioned the loss of a large case of retirement plan in the fourth quarter. I was hoping that maybe you could size it for us and give us a little background? And then for Randy, I would follow up Tom's question and ask about the actuarial assumption review and what kind of effect that might have on a go forward basis for the life business?","Dennis Glass","The case was about 600 million to 675 million in that range. And Randy you want to take the rest of that?","Randy Freitag","Sure, Steven, I'm not going to go beyond what I said earlier, which is both assumption changes and the primary one that impacts the Life business happens to be the change in the J-curve ultimate earned rate, we have modest negative impacts on run rate or so there will be a modest negative impact on Life earnings. I don't think of it as a number that would significantly change your models or your expectations. The business continues to grow also, as I mentioned. Drivers in that business continue to grow 3%, 4%. So while there will be a modest negative impact for a period of time, it's not a number that I can consider to be as such that I'm going to spike anything out. ","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Thanks, Randy. I thought you were just referring to Annuities at the time. ","Randy Freitag","But Steven just back for the question on the outflow, I do around want to reinforce and repeat what I said earlier which is. We expect flows to be positive in RPS to the year, which is quite an improvement over where we were last year.","Steven Schwartz","Dennis, what's the background of that loss? Is it a merger? Is it pricing? Can you fill that out?","Dennis Glass","Pricing and again losing businesses -- a good thing but the minimum guarantee in that contract was pretty high and still we weren\u2019t making a lot of money on it and so weren\u2019t as competitive as some other were to get the business.","Operator","At this time I'm showing no further question. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning. Apologizes I'm running a few minutes over. But as always, we are around to take your questions at the Investor Relations line at (800) 237-2920 or through email at investorrelations@lfg.com.

[Operator Instructions].","Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Kailey. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.","These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results were strong, with operating earnings per share up 15% compared to last year. This capped a solid year which included record EPS, a 9% increase in book value per share and a 12% ROE. Notably, we have a multi-year track record of similarly strong financial results; and, more importantly, we continue to believe these results are sustainable over time.","Our financial success and stability are the result of our clear and straightforward business model. As you know, we lead with distribution and product breadth. Nearly 90,000 independent brokers, agents and financial advisors have sold a Lincoln product in the past two years and we consistently focus on expanding our distribution reach. Our 1,300 highly sophisticated wholesalers and reps provide our independent producers with customer solutions and product education.","We match this distribution with one of the broadest product portfolios in the industry and are at the forefront of product innovation. This strategy works throughout cycles and was successful once again in 2016. This year, individual life insurance sales increased 7%; group protection sales were up 17%; and RPS deposits reached a record $7.7 billion.","2016 was a challenging year for sales growth in the annuity business which reflects somewhat of an adjusting market. But I am confident in our distribution and the product initiatives we're putting into place to respond. We expect these actions will rebuild sales momentum and enable us to return to full-year positive net flows in 2018.","In response to our lower annuity sales, we increased our share repurchases as we said we would; executing on another one of our core strategies which is to actively direct capital to the highest and best use. When combined with our solid capital generation, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders this year.","I won't touch on all strategies within our business model, but I do want to note that this year we're launching another dimension of strategy and that is to accelerate our utilization of digitization to improve our customer experience and increase efficiency. The born digital companies, such as Uber and Amazon, are raising customer service expectations and we're moving to meet this expectation. Additionally, through increased use of robotics and other innovative tools, we intend to lower our costs. This will require some investments. And Randy will get into the financial details. But at a high-level, after two years the project will be self-funding; and by 4 to 5 years out, we will see significant cost saves as well as potential revenue enhancements.","Now, turning to our business lines, starting with individual life. Our earnings were once again robust. And excluding notable items, we showed sequential improvement in earnings each quarter this year. Our sales were also outstanding, with total life insurance sales in the quarter of $231 million, a 17% increase from the prior-year quarter. Notably, nearly every product line generated double-digit growth. Individual life insurance sales increased 12% in the quarter and a solid 7% for the full year.","Let me spend a minute highlighting some product stories. MoneyGuard sales increased 19% in the quarter as we're benefiting from continued demand for linked benefit products and our multichannel distribution approach. For the full year, MoneyGuard sales reached a record $214 million. Term sales of $29 million increased 16% as we continued to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. Indexed universal life sales increased 15%, as IUL has seen outpaced growth over recent years due to an increase in GUL pricing.","I would also note that the industry has settled into last year's IUL illustration regulation which has brought more consistency to the marketplace.","Overall, our mix of sales continues to achieve our strategic objectives, including diversification, as all individual life products represented between 10% and 30% of total life insurance sales. A tilt away from long term guarantees, 66% of our sales did not have long term guarantees, up slightly. And lastly, strong returns, as expected, new business returns are achieving our target range of 12% to 15%. Our outlook for the life insurance business remains strong. And we expect growth to continue, driven by our diversified product portfolio combined with our leading distribution.","Turning to group protection, we continued to see a positive trajectory in our growth and profitability trends. Fourth quarter sales of $263 million were up 18% from the same period last year. And full-year sales were up nearly the same percentage, following two straight years of sales declines. We're pleased with this very strong sales rebound and it indicates the resilience of our distribution channel. Our pricing remains disciplined and our outlook for future sales growth is aligned with our long term target of middle-single-digit increases.","Just as important to drive future premium growth will be persistency improvements and the fourth quarter continued to indicate positive renewal persistency trends. With sales growth and improving persistency, our top line is also showing momentum as our premiums grew sequentially for the second straight quarter and we expect to reestablish annual premium growth in 2017.","As we have noted recently, top-line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story and we have seen many encouraging signs that support strong top- and bottom-line trends in our group business.","Turning to annuities, we posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter as the power of our high-quality, in-force business overcame a challenging year of variable annuity sales. Though I would note that sales have largely stabilized in recent quarters. We continue to expect long term growth in the annuity marketplace, given demographic trends and the fraying of traditional government and corporate safety nets.","As I noted up front, there is some adjusting taking place in the market driven by shift in consumer preferences. Importantly, many of the trends are ones we can address. And we actually see them as an opportunity to expand our distribution reach and the annuity marketplace over time.","Let me describe our strategies to regain momentum in the annuity business. As you know, there has been a trend towards fee-based compensation. Historically, the annuity market has been mostly commission-based, something we expect will continue. However, we're responding to this movement as we refreshed all of our fee-based products in January. We expect this will enable us to reach new advisors and we believe fee-based annuities present a significant long term growth opportunity. Another shift has been the increase in passive investments. As a result, we created a new product category. To this point, I hope you saw the announcement of our collaboration with BlackRock where we designed a simple, transparent and lower-cost, fee-based annuity. We expect this product to help capture the shift toward passive investments, as it is comprised exclusively of ETFs. Additionally, this product positions us well in the growing RIAA advisor space.","Lastly, we're responding to advisor feedback with product enhancements that provide clients more investment choice and flexibility which should offer them better upside potential, aligning with our historical value proposition of lower initial income but the potential for greater upside.","As you can see, we're leveraging our long-time successful playbook of expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. We expect all these actions to contribute to our sales recovery and build on our impressive track record of growth and profitability in our annuity business.","In retirement plan service, earnings were consistent with recent quarters and net flows were in line with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 15% as we benefited from strength in both the small and mid to large markets. Full-year results were very good story with record total deposits of $7.7 billion.","Total net flows for the quarter were $386 million. This marked our best quarter for net flows since the financial crisis. Full-year net flows increased 25% to $565 million. The increase was driven by a combination of growth in deposits and improvement in our withdrawal rate.","Looking ahead to 2017, our outlook is similar to this time last year, in that we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter to quarter in net flows. However, we expect another year of net flow improvement.","Our confidence is driven by our strategy which aligns the fastest-growing markets with customers that value our high touch service model. Importantly, we have a proven ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets while achieving our targeted returns which is giving us a lot of positive momentum.","Briefly on investment results, alternative investments had another solid quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 12% annualized return, consistent with the third quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase our alternative earnings over time as we grow the portfolio and further shift mix towards private equity.","In terms of new money, we have seen a meaningful increase in yields since the election. Post-election, we have been investing new money at 4.1%. This has reduced the spread between new money and the fixed income portfolio yield to 70 basis points and cut the headwind to earnings growth from 3% to 2%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment grade assets represent just 5.2% of our fixed income portfolio, consistent with last year; as the de-risking actions we took earlier in the year significantly reduced our exposure to negative ratings migration and improved our credit portfolio -- profile.","Before turning the call over to Randy, I'd like to just touch on some potential impacts from the new administration, recognizing it is too early to reach specific conclusions. First, it is important to note we build our strategy, financial growth plans and shareholder value creation around things within our control. But I would point out that some of the new administration policies and proposals have the possibility of providing us incremental tailwinds. An increase in economic growth and possibly higher interest rates can help with margin compression; but, just as important, would provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products.","Although not assured, there is an increasing likelihood of a delay to the Department of Labor fiduciary rule and a focus on improving the rule's ultimate objective, something we support. If this were to occur, we believe it could remove some of the confusion in the marketplace that is contributing to the decline in annuity sales.","Lastly, on tax reform, hard to pinpoint where this will land, but we also see this as an additional benefit. So again, still early, but there is potential for incremental growth levers and we will be sure to update you on the impacts of these as we learn more.","So, I'm pleased with our solid-fourth quarter results and our record operating earnings per share in 2016. Importantly, we're proving time and time again that our business model enables us to take advantage of emerging opportunities, as well as overcome cyclical or structural headwinds.","As we enter 2017, we have a lot of positive momentum. And I like the fact that we continue to be on the offensive, as key drivers of our financial success remain well within our control. Notably, we're positioned to drive organic growth through our leading distribution channels and our broad set of customer solutions. We continue to find opportunities to leverage the strength of our in-force business. And we will continue our successful track record of returning capital to shareholders.","In closing, Lincoln's business model is simple, clear and straightforward and it produces solid and repeatable financial results. We're proud of our long term performance and pleased that it continues to reward our shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported income from operations of $409 million or $1.77 per share for the fourth quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. I would note a few items that drove some variability within the segments this quarter. On the positive side were $8 million of benefit on the tax line and other operations and $13 million of favorable variable investment income spread across the businesses.","These two items were completely offset by some expense items, including an increase in deferred comp-related expenses associated with the $19 increase in our share price during the quarter and higher variable expenses from strong sales growth in most of our businesses. Additionally, we had favorable mortality which I will speak to later.","Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $6.50 was a record and up 19%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 7%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $57.05. Operating return on equity was strong at 12.7% in the quarter and 12% for the full year.","Positive consolidated net flows have contributed to account values that continue to grow from depressed levels earlier in the year, providing a nice earnings tailwind. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength, supported by solid liquidity metrics and strong capital generation. This enabled us to return $261 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the full year. Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, our year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies. And we completed our goodwill review which did not have any impairment.","Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items. The largest item was a $178 million net loss from variable annuity net derivative results, with more than half of this being a non-economic charge related to non-performance risk which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Fund basis risk made up the majority of the remaining amount.","I would remind you that, over time, this sort of breakage has summed up to essentially zero; so I wouldn't be surprised to see that come back at some point in time.","Taking advantage of that narrowing credit spread, we did complete an economically advantageous tender for some higher-coupon debt in December which resulted in a $41 million loss on the early extinguishment.","Before shifting to segment results, let me discuss the digitization initiative. In addition to the strategic benefits Dennis discussed in his remarks, I would note that we do see an opportunity to take significant expenses out of the business over the next several years. Now, analogous to an M&A transaction, there will be integration costs or investments made to ultimately get the run rate savings.","You can see, in our statistical supplement, we have begun reporting a strategic digitization expense in other operations. In the fourth quarter it was $8 million, pre-tax. And we would expect roughly $10 million a quarter in 2017, though we could see some quarterly variability based on the timing of certain projects.","I would note we're trying to strike the right balance in terms of protecting near term results while also capitalizing on efficiency opportunities which will lower our expense base. To this point, during the first two years of this initiative we would expect annual net costs of $40 million, pre-tax. By year three, the earnings impact should be neutral. And in the fourth year, we will begin to see meaningful cost savings which I would size at 6% to 10% of our $1.5 billion in addressable G&A expenses. Hopefully this gives you a good sense of the positive long term opportunity around digitization and also the visibility and transparency to incorporate assumptions within your models.","Now I will turn to segment results. Starting with life insurance, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $154 million compared to $119 million last year. Included in the current quarter's earnings were favorable mortality results, consistent with our expectations for the fourth quarter of any year.","I want to spend a minute analyzing 2016 mortality experience, as I believe it represents a reasonable proxy for how we think about long term results and seasonality. For the year, we had good mortality results, with our actual to expected mortality coming in at 99%. Now, we did see quite a bit of variability in mortality quarter to quarter, much of which I would attribute to seasonality. For example, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million in the first quarter, with roughly two-thirds of that related to typical seasonality. Ultimately, what we expect is to make up this negative seasonality during the second half of the year and this is what occurred this year.","Shifting to spreads, base spreads which exclude variable investment income, were down 6 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed in the past. Given the movement in interest rates, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017.","Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances and life insurance in force both up 4% to 5%. Overall, this year's earnings were consistent with our expectations while our strong sales results and key driver growth support earnings growth looking forward.","Group protection earnings of $16 million increased from $13 million in the prior-year quarter. Our loss ratios continued to show improvement. This was somewhat offset by higher variable expenses tied to strong sales growth. Our non-medical loss ratio improved to 70.9% from 75.3% in the prior-year quarter. This 440 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all of our product lines. Notably, our full-year loss ratio showed similar improvements which resulted in increase in annual earnings of over 50%.","As we have discussed, top-line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And as Dennis noted, we expect annual premium growth to reemerge in 2017. As you recall, we typically experience seasonally higher DAC amortization in the first quarter. This is tied to the first quarter being our heaviest renewal period. This year, given improvement in our persistency, we expect amortization to be roughly half of what we experienced in the first quarter of 2016.","So, overall, another solid quarter and strong year for the group business and we expect that positive momentum to continue. In annuities, reported earnings for the quarter were $242 million, flat versus the prior-year quarter. Average account values were down 1% for the year as negative net flows more than offset positive market performance. So I would note that end-of-period balances did increase 3% on the back of strong equity market performance over the last three quarters. As a result, we saw sequential growth in reported earnings during every quarter of the year.","Return metrics remain strong. Our ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points while ROE came in at 21% for the quarter and full year. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past four years and has averaged 20% for a decade. Outstanding results that highlight our differentiated and high-quality annuity book.","In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $34 million, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue was up 3% compared to the prior-year period; while spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 13 basis points for the full year. This is near the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point guidance. And looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. Return on assets was 23 basis points for the fourth quarter and the full year.","Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows including nearly $400 million of flows in the fourth quarter. Combined with positive changes in equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to more than $58 billion.","2016 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, a 25% increase in net flows and consistent returns. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we're well-positioned for continued momentum in 2017.","Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, the capital, we're extremely well-positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up nearly $400 million from the prior-year period. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the year at approximately 490%, consistent with the prior year. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $561 million of cash at the holding company.","In terms of capital deployment, I noted up front we returned more than $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, up slightly from the prior year. As you know, our mix of cash returned to shareholders has been weighted more towards buybacks than dividends. We expect that trend to continue, as we see the current share price is undervalued and an excellent use of capital.","We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. For example, in the past six years, we have returned nearly $5 billion to shareholders, with $4 billion of this through buybacks at an average price of under $38, reducing our shares outstanding by nearly one-third. This year, we returned 72% of our operating earnings to shareholders which is above our long term free cash flow target of 50% to 55%.","While our long term target remains unchanged, we expect to be approximately 10 points above that range in 2017 as we leverage the strength of our balance sheet. Notably, the Board recently approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing it back up to $1 billion.","So, to conclude, 2016 was an excellent year. We reported record operating EPS. Book value per share grew to over $57, a record; and up 9%. And our ROE was strong at 12%. Let me remind you, this follows a period where over the past six years, EPS has grown at an annual rate of 12%; book value per share has increased at a 7% rate; and our ROE has expanded nearly 300 basis points.","As we look forward, we're excited about our digitization initiative which will deliver real value to the bottom line. We fully expect to continue generating positive net flows and premium growth across all our businesses. And, lastly, our balance sheet is as strong as it has ever been. And our ability to generate capital remains robust which will enable us to continue our strong track record of returning capital to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and just one follow up; then re-queue for additional questions.","And now I will turn things over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","I just wanted to start with the variable annuity flow picture. Can you talk about the timing of the rollout or the pace of rollout for that new product, the BlackRock ETF-based product? And do you see this in any way cannibalizing some percentage of your existing VA production?","Dennis Glass","No. The core income, the BlackRock product I think -- not I think, but I've said -- is a new product category. It's been approved in a lot of states. We're signing up with broker-dealers. There is technology involved in executing with the broker-dealers. And so I think we expect this to grow over time. The more significant sales results will probably be later part of this year and into the next year.","Suneet Kamath","And then your comment on the positive flows in 2018. My assumption is that means you might still be negative this year. Does that assume no change to Department of Labor as it currently stands?","Randy Freitag","Correct.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then the last one for Randy, just as we think about that new BlackRock product, is there any material change in the capital strain guidance that you've given us for VA? I think it's been like $0.05 for every $1 of VA capital strain on the old product. What is that for the new product?","Randy Freitag","I don't think of it as materially changing the guidance we've given. As I've talked about in the past, the profile for a product that is more of a fee-based product as opposed to a commission-based product is that you have less investment up front which drives two things. That drives typically a little lower ROA, but a little higher ROE.","This product is going to be a percentage of our overall sales. And so I don't see it making a significant change in either of those two return metrics which I'd remind -- our ROA is in the high 70s and an ROE which has been running in excess of 20%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Dally","With capital management being 10 points above the longer term average of 50% to 55% in 2017, what's driving that? Is that a reflection of the somewhat weaker annuity sales that we've been seeing this year? Or are there some reserve refinancings on the horizon? Just wanted to get some additional color there.","Randy Freitag","Nigel, I'll talk about it in comparison to what we did this year. So this year we ended up at 72% of operating earnings which is roughly 20 points above the midpoint of our long term range. 20 points translates into about $300 million of additional share repurchases.","If you broke that down, I would say about $200 million of that came from the reinsurance transaction we did earlier in the year which generated a significant amount of capital; and about $100 million of it came from the fact that variable annuity sales were below where they had been in the past.","As you look forward and as Dennis talked about, I would continue to expect the VA sales to be below our long term expectations. So I think that will drive some of the continued increase that I talked about. And then just the strength of our balance sheet will drive the other piece.","Nigel Dally","Then just a follow-up on the passive variable annuities. I know it's early on in the rollout process, but just would be interested as to the kind of reception that you got from the first distributors that you've introduced it to.","Dennis Glass","It's probably one of the most exciting product concepts that we've ever delivered into the marketplace. So, distribution partners, advisors are quite excited about it. But, Nigel, I'd like to repeat that it's technology-based; and so the rollout is going to be effective and efficient. But just like any new product, it's going to take time to build sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Just wanted to discuss what's going on behind the scenes with what's been driving the variable annuity sales weakness. Is it -- do you think it's that you've seen a big shift, move away from frontload commission type products broadly? And that's predominantly how VAs have been sold and the move to level fee commissions is kind of a tricky transition because that's not historically a lot of the way those products have been sold. Can you talk a bit about is that really what's driving it? And do you think that despite what happens with DOL, that you think a lot of distributors have moved in that direction and they are going to stay there, so we're going to see a depressing impact for a while here?","Dennis Glass","Yes, that's a multi-faceted question. Let me talk about a couple of responses to the general trends that we have. And let me talk first about our core value proposition that has led to what we all know as the strongest in-force block of business from a quality, risk and earnings perspective in the industry. And that quality was built off of a base that value proposition to the consumer of upside potential and lower initial guarantees. So, that value proposition remains in the marketplace. It's been hurt a little bit by lower returns inside the sub-accounts, some of that related to risk managed funds.","So our response to that -- and we're able to be responsive inside of that category because interest rates have moved up a little bit, giving us a little bit more flexibility. So what we're doing in that product category is providing more investment flexibility. So, for example, in the past we may have had a requirement of 70% equity, 30% debt and we're modifying that a little bit. Again because of the interest rate environment we're able to, a little bit, up the initial payout rates or the initial income payout rates. So we've got that block of business. And again, it's been affected a little bit by fund performance, but we're responding to that.","Then there is a second value proposition which is even more investment flexibility but with a lower initial income payout. And that's very exciting, again taking our initial equity debt relationship with 70\/30 -- or, excuse me, 60\/40 to 70\/30. So there is an ability to get more equity into the account, giving more upside potential; and also, the removal of the risk managed funds in that particular product category. So, lower income initially with more investment restrictions; just one of them with upside potential and the other one I just described.","Then a whole new product category is what we talked about in terms of the BlackRock product, both in terms of the structure of the product, as well as the opportunity to go into the retirement income -- excuse me, the registered investment advisor channel.","Then finally, there is a lot of activity in the traditional deferred income annuity accumulation product space; that fixed income and fixed index annuities being a part of that and were strengthening that as well.","So I can't say that there's one market adjustment that's affecting the overall market. It's a whole series of things. And we have products and plans in place to address each one of them.","I do think, though, coming back specifically to the Department of Labor and the whole issue around commissions and the lack of -- because there's been so much what would I say -- it's been unclear at the -- our distribution partners exactly how this was going to turn out. Even if the existing rule was to turn out, the rule had to be interpreted; technology changes. And so the distribution partners have been a little bit slow to communicate to their own advisors where we're going to end up.","So I think that the DOL issue has probably had a lot more impact. And whether or not it's delayed, I think that confusion will go away on April 17 when everybody has to implement their final plans.","So a lot of different effects on the marketplace. I'll finish with two things. One, I continue to believe that, long term, the individual annuity market, whether it's for accumulation or for guaranteed lifetime income, is going to be robust and vibrant. And our product development is addressing the issues that we can address and confident that we will recover our sales momentum.","Thomas Gallagher","Then just a follow-up. Do you have broad level statistics in terms of what percent of your VA sales are frontload commission? I know there's different structures; but just broadly, frontload versus level fee. My understanding, from an industry standpoint, the vast preponderance of sales have been frontload. Just curious if that's the case for you. And do you think that will be an evolution for the industry, to make a big move in that direction? And do you see there being kind of a longer transition period if it does move in that direction?","Dennis Glass","To your point, the entire industry has been built on commissions and active fund management in the subaccounts. And so that's going to move -- those two pieces are going to move a little bit. Instead of just commissions, you are going to have fee-based products; and as I mentioned, more passive opportunities for investments inside.","And let me differentiate that for a second. When I talk about commission and active, that's a set of financial advisors that exist and are selling annuities. And some of the refreshment activities we've had in our product set address that particular advisor cohort, such as reducing the fees within -- on the fee-based part of it, reducing the fees; paying for that with lower payments out to the broker-dealers. That will move, I think, gradually over time, as between the amount of people that use commissions and the amount of people that prefer fees. And that's going to be, in part, based on what their customers' preference is. So that's going to move forward.","The second issue is a little different. And that is the RIA market which is pretty significant market in the United States where the annuities haven't been a big piece of what they've provided. There is one firm that has been reasonably successful. I think that's the area for additional cohort of financial advisors, expanding the distribution opportunity beyond what exists today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Can you talk about how much margins on new business have improved in both life and annuities, as a result of higher interest rates and lower hedge costs?","Randy Freitag","Eric, let me sort of break it up by the products. I think the products most impacted would be in the annuity and the life business. In the annuity businesses, as Dennis has talked about, the increase in interest rates has allowed us to make some changes on the products which we believe will make them more attractive to consumers. So I don't think that the increase in interest rates has had a huge impact on the returns that we expect on those products.","I think maybe on fixed annuities, you get a little bit of a boost. Because if you get a little higher return on your surplus, they get a little better metric there. But I wouldn't say it's a material impact.","On the life side, we have been running strong returns, 12% to 15%, for some time now. And I don't expect that to change materially. I think the market will respond to rates with either benefit changes or premium decreases. So I wouldn't expect a material change in the returns we're getting on the life business which have been strong for a number of years now.","Dennis Glass","I would add a little bit -- not change -- but just add to what Randy said. And that is, day in and day out, we try to get our required returns in capital on products. There's a lot of input to pricing, interest rates being one of them as interest rates change. In terms of pricing, that gives us more flexibility. But we're driven by our return on capital requirements, no matter what the environment is.","Erik Bass","And I guess just then thinking about the interest rate benefit, is it really that you get a recovery in spreads back to normal levels, so you would lose that I guess now 2% drag on earnings that way? But in terms of the returns, it sounds like a lot of the benefit of higher rates stops dropping to the bottom line, once kind of you've recovered that spread. Is that the right way of thinking about it?","Randy Freitag","Eric, it's a big deal that spread compression goes away. I'd remind you if you just took one of our businesses, the life business, it's a sum total over the last four or five years of nearly $100 million of impact from spread compressions from its in-force. So you take that away and that's a big deal both for that business and the company in total.","So the biggest financial impact and the impact you are going to see immediately, is because that spread compression number goes down. As you mentioned, we were at between 2% to 3%. We're now down at about 2%. So you've got a little bit less spread compression and that's a benefit across the Company -- and from that standpoint.","On new business -- and Dennis mentioned this in his comments - it allows products to become -- to get adjusted in a way that makes them more attractive to consumers. You are able to offer more benefit or lower premiums which makes these products not only more attractive to consumers, but more competitive with other options they may have. So I think that's a big deal from a new business standpoint, if you can see those new sales levels move up.","Factually, new business has never had a huge impact on the earnings we expect in the next year or two. That's more about the growth of the business. So anything, I think, that drives sales higher is -- it's a positive for the long term outlook for the organization.","Erik Bass","Okay. So at a minimum, you get 2% kind of improvement back to your normalized growth rate. And then additional sales volumes would be a long term plus to that, as well.","Randy Freitag","Absolutely. As Dennis mentioned, we're invested at about 4.1% right now. So, that's about 70 basis points below our portfolio. So that would be the number that would eliminate that; but at the level we're at right now, we're at about a 2% headwind.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Nadel","The first question is, for 2016, any reason to believe that the dividend received, the DRD benefit in your tax rate was significantly different from the roughly $190 million benefit it provided in 2015?","Randy Freitag","No. It was actually almost perfectly level at about $180 million, actually. So it did not change materially, John. And, John, it's good to know that you guys are working hard on a Thursday here in February.","John Nadel","Yes, definitely working hard, Randy; maybe not as hard as you guys are. So then, the question is -- the next question, just thinking about the drop in annuities sales; and I know you guys have done a great job of sort of redeploying the capital not used to fund annuities sales into primarily buybacks. Am I doing the math right?","If I think about annuities sales in 2016 were down $4.4 billion, $4.5 billion year-over-year. Using the roughly 5% capital requirement or strain, I would've thought we would see something more along the lines of $200 million to $250 million of incremental capital deployment. It sounds, from your earlier comments, like about $100 million of your buybacks in 2016 was related to redeployment of capital, not used to fund sales.","Randy Freitag","John, I think one of the things in your math which is largely correct as math goes, is when we gave that guidance, I think the run rate of sales was a little lower. So the amount of sales drop isn't -- that went into that math -- isn't quite at that $4.5 billion level.","So that would be one aspect. You also saw a shift in some products to fixed annuity sales, a little bit which are a little more capital-intensive than variable annuities. So that was a little bit of a drag on the math. But roughly speaking, what we said came true, in that we were able to overcome the drag on earnings caused by the lower annuities sales through share repurchases in 2016.","Now I would note when you look forward, that math changes a little bit because of the increase in share price. We can't buy quite back the same number of shares per $1 that we use. So there is a little bit of drag just using that math. But in 2016, factually, we were able to overcome the drag from lower sales through share repurchases.","John Nadel","High-quality problem; I don't think your shareholders will give you a hard time over that. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","I had a couple of questions. The first one is just on the individual life business. You spoke about the seasonality in the business. But obviously earnings have moved even more so than the seasonality might imply. So do you view the 2016 earnings number for the business as more of a normal annual level going forward? Or did results benefit from variable investment income or other items that might not repeat to the same extent?","Randy Freitag","Yes, Jimmy, I think of the year as almost perfectly in line with what I've said in the past which is that this business is about $125 million a year business or $500 million for a full year --","Jimmy Bhullar","$125 million a quarter. Yes, yes.","Randy Freitag","Yes, excuse me. And if you think about the year, we made $550 million and that included $17 million positive unlocking. So right at that $125 million guidance. In terms of the quarter, the $154 million, we had strong variable investment income. That was largely offset, as I mentioned, by expenses.","So at the end of the day, what you just had was mortality, really good mortality driving the $154 million of earnings; which, just coincidentally, was almost an exact mirror of the first quarter of the year. As I said in the first quarter of the year, about $20 million of expected seasonality. We had about $10 million of additional; total of $30 million this quarter. About $29 million of benefit overall, compared to an average quarter, from good, strong mortality which we expect to happen in that quarter of the year.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then on the variable investment income being strong, can you just give a little bit of color on what the drivers were and also discuss where you are on your plan to reduce your hedge fund exposure?","Randy Freitag","It was strong across all areas. So the PE and hedge funds, I think as Dennis might have mentioned in his script, the return was about 12% for the quarter. And we expect 10%, long term. So we had good, strong performance from the alts portfolio. And then, prepayment income was above what we've experienced over the last 4 to 5 years and was over what I would expect over a much longer cycle.","In total, it came up to about $13 million after tax, as I mentioned in my script. I would say that was fairly evenly split, maybe a little skewed towards prepayment income. If you broaden this out and you think about alternatives and prepayment income over a longer cycle and you look at the last couple of years, what you've seen is that alternatives in both of those years were a little below our long term expectations.","So for the full year, we were about $40 million lower than we would expect on the alternative side, whereas prepayment income was a little stronger. When you add them together, I don't think we're materially different from what a longer term expectation might be for the sum of those two items.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","I had a question regarding capital deployment. You mentioned buybacks as probably being still quite elevated or strong in 2017. One part that I was surprised I didn't hear you talk about was the potential for M&A. I think in the past, you talked about being interested in morbidity business. I think interest rates are higher. The group business has turned around. You may see less of a regulatory risk here. Is that still something that you are considering or maybe looking at more carefully today?","Dennis Glass","M&A is always a tool. And over the last 22, 20 years or so, we've used it pretty effectively to really achieve what would otherwise would be our plan anyway. And so whenever we do M&A, it's because we're trying to accelerate a strategy; not to do it for the sake of doing it. You are correct; we have said that we have a longer term strategy of increasing the percentage of our income that comes from mortality and morbidity; and that sort of in terms of our businesses, we would probably think the group business as the top priority. So, that's the strategy.","Deals coming into market come episodically. We'll continue to look at things. We've looked at some properties in the last 24 months and back to our allocating capital to the best use, it was way more expensive. Properties sold for way more than what we think would make sense for our use of capital. But it made a lot of good sense for the people who bought it. I don't know what their strategies were.","So, prices would probably have to come down a little bit before we got real interested in a deal. But we'll keep looking. We're good at assessing M&A. We're good at integrating M&A. And if something comes along that fits with our long term strategy, all of which points we have articulated, we would take a look. I will say that we wouldn't do anything that would materially affect our share buyback program over time.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then switching gears a little bit to the digitalization initiative. Just want to get a little more understanding of the numbers. So as -- I'm assuming that 2019 that -- the breakeven year, you expect to see some cost saves flowing in and then those really ramping up in beyond that. So, can you give us a little bit of color as to where you see those cost saves coming in? Which segments would be more impacted? I'm assuming that the expenses -- that the related expenses will remain in the corporate segment or corporate and other. But where could we see the benefits?","Dennis Glass","Maybe let's back up a little bit as I answer that question. We have, over the past four months, have had an internal team at Lincoln; the core team, eight or 10 people. We have had another 25 or 30 people from our outside consultant and then we've involved overall probably another 100 people from Lincoln. And what we've spent our time doing is really trying to understand where the best opportunities are to both improve the customer experience -- I don't want to lose that concept -- improve the customer experience; and then as we're doing that, make sure that we find ways to finance that investment.","And so the numbers that we're talking about are not just pulled out of the pocket. But they are the consequences of four months of pretty hard work and detail and math.","Now, having said that, as we move into the execution and repeating what Randy said, we're going to have to pay attention to short term earnings as well as long term opportunity. And the execution phase is very important. And I think it would be pretty premature to try to identify exactly what line of business is going to get the most benefit.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the question-and-answer session. We will be able to follow up with those in the queue later this afternoon.","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Giovanni.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","And I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Well, 2018 continues to be an outstanding year, as third quarter adjusted operating earnings and earnings per share were records, with EPS up 15% from the prior-year quarter. Additionally, book value per share increased 8% and return on equity was 14.5%.","This quarter's strong results were also broad-based and highlight the power of our retail franchise, which brings together a comprehensive and growing product portfolio, along with expanding distribution. Targeted management actions are further enhancing our results with annuity net flows close to turning positive, group results benefiting from our Liberty acquisition, strategic investments improving expense efficiencies and future growth opportunities, and capital deployment remaining ever important.","As you know, during the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review, which had a negligible impact on our financials, consistent with past years. Overall, the balance sheet remains strong and the complementary nature of our businesses and sources of earnings enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow. We are returning this capital to shareholders through an active share buyback program and growth in dividends, including last night's announced 12% increase in the common stock dividend.","Now, turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Earnings results were strong as we continued to benefit from our high-quality and predictable in-force business combined with equity market tailwinds. Annuity sales were robust as our strategy of adding new products and expanding distribution continues to show meaningful progress. This quarter, new products and expanded distribution represented 39% of annuity sales.","Total annuity sales increased 61% to $3.1 billion, and third quarter sales, which are typically weaker due to seasonality, improved sequentially for the first time since 2010. In addition to stronger sales, we are also getting a higher rate of return on new business, given the improving interest rate environment. Net outflows showed further improvement and totaled just $81 million in the quarter. I remain optimistic we will return to positive net flows in the fourth quarter.","This quarter's variable annuity sales were strong, up 43% compared to the prior-year quarter and also broad-based, with guaranteed and non-guaranteed products and all distribution channels delivering at least 20% growth. Guaranteed VA sales increased 48%, but represented less than half of total annuity sales, highlighting the expansion and increased diversification of our product portfolio.","Our newest product, Lincoln Level Advantage, an indexed variable annuity, has been our most successful product launch ever. Level Advantage sales totaled $266 million in the quarter and we continue to ramp up sales with the addition of new distribution partners. Fixed annuity sales more than doubled to nearly $200 million (sic) [$900 million], resulting from significant growth in the bank and broker-dealer channels. In addition, we recently entered a new distribution channel, independent marketing organizations, and we are seeing early success.","I'm also happy to announce that, in January, we will further advance our distribution strategy by entering yet another new channel, the property and casualty distribution channel via a relationship with Allstate. This relationship gives Allstate's more than 10,000 selling agents access to Lincoln's suite of fixed and variable annuity solutions. This additional scale should initially add approximately 5% to annuity sales growth. Looking forward, the sales outlook remains positive, given our strategy of significant distribution and product expansion, combined with LIMRA's forecast for industry sales growth to continue in 2019.","Longer term, growth prospects are compelling. A recent survey of financial advisers showed the percentage of advisers that believe their clients are underinvested in annuities, nearly doubled to 37%, up from 19% just four years ago. The demographic backdrop also creates considerable opportunities with investable assets projected to more than double by 2030 and the 65 years and older age cohort, which is a sweet spot for lifetime income, expected to grow 40% over that period versus 2% growth in the under-65-year olds. So, a strong quarter for the Annuity business and near- and long-term growth prospects are very promising.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings increased 14% over the prior-year quarter. Deposits in the quarter of $3.3 billion were up 74% from a year ago, and first-year sales of $2 billion nearly tripled. The sale of $1 billion healthcare plan is included in these results. Without this plan, sales still increased 50%. Recurring deposits also increased 9% as a result of higher employee contribution rates and increases in participation.","Net flows totaled $1.4 billion compared to $442 million in the prior-year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have exceeded $2.8 billion and we have achieved positive net flows for 11 straight quarters. Sales and net flows can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but these impressive results are being driven by the strength of our high-touch and high-tech business model, which positions us to effectively compete in our target markets. We remain confident in growth opportunities for the RPS business.","Turning to Life Insurance, earnings increased 45%. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $167 million were down 6%. On the positive side, we saw 7% growth in core life, led by strong VUL sales. This was offset by a decline in MoneyGuard and also Executive Benefits sales, which can be lumpy quarter to quarter. On a sequential basis, sales improved 3%, consistent with comments made last quarter, pointing to expected sales momentum in the second half of the year.","In aggregate, expected new business returns exceeded our target levels. Given these strong returns, higher interest rates and ability to leverage industry-leading product and distribution capabilities, we have initiatives in place to improve our competitive position, sales diversification, and growth as we enter 2019. This leaves the Life business well-positioned in the marketplace.","Turning to Group Protections, earnings of $63 million increased significantly, which resulted in a 6.2% after-tax margin. Premiums more than doubled, driven by the acquisition, continued sales growth, and strong persistency results. During the quarter, sales increased 68%, again, primarily attributable to the acquisition, which resulted in growth in the Life and the Disability product lines in both employer- and employee-paid sales.","As we enter the fourth quarter and the important January 1 renewal season, we are optimistic about our ability to grow premiums as we sustain persistency trends, while also achieving modest rate increases. Additionally, we expect to effectively compete for new business opportunities across all case sizes, given our increased scale, broader distribution, access, and expanded capabilities.","In summary, we are pleased with another quarter of strong results and the integration remains on track as we focus on delivering upside to the key financial metrics highlighted when the acquisition was announced.","Shifting to investment results, solid performance from private equity portfolio led to a 13% pre-tax annualized return on alternative investments. We have invested new money at an average yield of 4.3% in the quarter and the fixed income portfolio yield declined 1 basis point from the second quarter.","It is also worth noting that we are currently investing new money near the 4.6% portfolio rate. While we still have some higher-yield assets running off through 2019, at current interest rate levels, spread compression will largely abate in 2020. You may recall that spread compression has been a 2% to 5% annual headwind to EPS growth in recent years, so removing this will be a big help. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape. Credit losses are minimal and below-investment-grade assets represent less than 4% of our fixed income portfolio.","While credit remains benign and we are not forecasting a change in the current environment, we have been doing some proactive derisking within sectors and securities that have greater risk of deterioration in a stressed environment. I'm confident the investment portfolio and balance sheet are well positioned.","Before turning over to Randy, I'd like to make a few comments and observations regarding the effectiveness and resiliency of our retail-centric business model, which has demonstrated a track record of success that I believe remains underappreciated. I would note that over the past five years, financial metrics have been very strong.","Just a few: EPS has grown at a 12% annual growth rate with growth each and every year in EPS, excluding notable items. These results have come after absorbing more than $200 million of spread compression. Additionally, our annual assumption reviews have been non-events, with a cumulative impact during this period of just under $100 million or less than 1% of book value. Book value per share has grown at a 9% rate and ROE has expanded to 13.5% year-to-date. Net income has represented 93% of operating income.","Looking at capital management, since 2012, we have deployed a $6.5 billion of capital through buybacks, dividends, and M&A, which represents 72% of operating earnings. Importantly, we have achieved all these results, while taking on less risk and improving the strength of our balance sheet and capital position. We have tilted our new business away from products with long-term guarantees and increased the portion of earnings coming from traditional insurance risks. In terms of balance sheet quality, debt leverage has decreased 2 points and investment leverage has declined. Finally, statutory capital has increased nearly $2 billion.","We remain focused on executing our strategy, which will enable us to continue to report solid financial results. We believe the share price will ultimately reflect our proven track record and an ability to sustain our performance.","In the meantime, we are looking at opportunities to take advantage of the current low valuation, such as monetizing some portion of our in-force business. The environment for block reinsurance transactions looks to be good. And if a deal makes sense, it would enable us to generate and free up capital to use for a significant share buyback program on top of our normal free cash flow guidance.","So, in closing, we are pleased with the quarter's record earnings and believe our valuation has significant upside, given our proven long-term success, current momentum, and positive financial outlook.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported adjusted income from operations of $510 million or $2.34 per share for the third quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter included net unfavorable items of $0.01 related to our annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions, while the prior year quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 21% year-over-year.","This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions had a series of modest plusses and minuses, including favorable impacts in Annuities and Group Protection, offset by slightly unfavorable impacts in Life and RPS. When viewed in total, the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound and the modest financial impacts highlight the quality of our in-force business, which differentiates Lincoln from many of our competitors. It is also worth noting that we did not unlock the reversion to the mean corridor, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets.","Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Underlying trends were strong as all four businesses generated revenue growth, coupled with good expense management which, when combined with benefits from tax reform, resulted in our Group, RPS, and Life Insurance segments reporting double-digit increases in operating earnings. Excluding notable items, Annuities also reported double-digit growth.","Consolidated net flows of $2.4 billion continue to increase, and when combined with equity market growth, average account values increased 7%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to over $66, while adjusted operating return on equity was strong at 14.5%. Our balance sheet and capital generation continue to be sources of strength, enabling us to return $247 million to shareholders in the quarter. Lastly, net income of $490 million or 96% of operating income further highlights the strength of the quarter.","Now, turning to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $302 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income with average account values up 5% over the past year to $139 billion, as equity market strength more than offset negative net flows. Annuity earnings benefited $13 million from this year's annual assumption review, compared to $15 million last year. This is the latest in a very long string of modest and favorable unlocking impacts in the Annuity business due to little variation between assumptions and actual experience.","In fact, over the last decade, the sum total of impact to operating earnings has been positive $21 million or less than one-third of 1% of the $7.5 billion of annuity earnings that we have reported over that same period. Not only is that unprecedented performance, but I believe it is completely underappreciated by the marketplace.","Annuity net flows were close to turning positive in the quarter with net outflows of just $81 million, compared to $841 million in the prior year quarter. Total operating revenue increased 4%, while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 2%. Return metrics were strong with ROA at 87 basis points and an ROE of 24%, while our risk profile remains low with the net amount at risk for both living and death benefits below 0.6%. So, great results for the annuity business with another quarter of high-quality earnings and net flows that are set to turn positive, leaving us well positioned to build on this success.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $40 million compared to $35 million in the prior year. The earnings increase is attributable to benefits from tax reform, higher fee income, and expense management. Net flows of $2.8 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $71 billion, up 12%.","G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 3% year-over-year, resulting in an approximate 90 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. Base spreads excluding variable investment income compressed 9 basis points versus the prior year, while ROA was 24 basis points, excluding a modest $2 million negative impact from the annual assumption review. So, a solid result for the Retirement business, highlighted by robust net flows, which are helping drive asset and revenue growth, coupled with continued strong expense management.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $176 million increased from $121 million in the prior-year quarter, driven by solid revenue growth, favorable mortality, lower expenses and benefits of tax reform. The current quarter included a $20 million negative impact from the annual assumption review, largely consistent with the prior year. Growth and earnings drivers remained steady, with average account values up 6% and average Life Insurance in-force up 4%. A 9% increase in operating revenue, combined with a 5% decrease in G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, drove a 100 basis point improvement in the expense ratio.","Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 19 basis points year-over-year due to a one-time negative impact on policy loan income. In the near-term, we expect spreads to compress approximately 5 basis points on an annualized basis. So, a great quarter for the Life business, highlighted by favorable mortality experience and strong earnings growth.","Group Protection reported $63 million in earnings compared to $41 million in the prior year quarter, with the increase in earnings primarily from the acquisition of Liberty. The after-tax margin was 6.2% or 5.5%, when excluding a $7 million benefit from the annual reserve review. Non-medical earned premiums were $1 billion, up 102% from the prior-year quarter. This increase was the result of both the acquisition and continued momentum in key premium growth drivers, namely sales and persistency.","Overall, risk results remained favorable. The non-medical loss ratio of 73.6% is consistent with the second quarter when factoring in a full quarter of Liberty results. As a reminder, the increase in the loss ratio compared to the prior-year quarter merely reflects the impact from the acquisition as we combined two blocks of business with loss ratios that are different based on case sizes.","So, it was another very strong quarter for the Group business. The after-tax margin is already within our targeted range, and we are optimistic about our ability to provide further margin upside over time as we execute on our repricing program and deliver expense savings.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus came in at $9.3 billion, and the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 460%. Holding company cash remains above our $450 million target. During the quarter, we returned $247 million to shareholders, including $175 million of share repurchases, consistent with our free cash flow guidance. Year-to-date, we have allocated nearly $2 billion towards M&A, buybacks, and dividends, and expect to be active in the fourth quarter.","So, wrapping things up, another excellent quarter. We reported record EPS as we combined growth in pre-tax earnings, capital management, and benefits from tax reform to drive a 15% increase in EPS from the prior year. High-quality results, as all four businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. This year's annual review, once again, confirmed the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet, as there was almost no impact on earnings. And finally, key shareholder metrics were solid as book value per share increased 8% and ROE came in at 14.5%.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, and then requeue with additional questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Crystal to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I had a question first just on Dennis' comments on sort of potentially monetizing part of the in-force block and using the proceeds for buybacks. Is this something that you've looked into in detail or are you sort of in the preliminary stages? And just some thoughts around what blocks you'd consider reinsuring and where you are in the whole process.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Jimmy, just like in M&A, we're not going to get into the details about anything specific. We're aware of \u2013 let me just say it this way, we're aware of the marketplace for the sale of blocks. Of course, being aware means we've talked to different parties. So, I would say, we have the general understanding of the potential. Of course, going from a general understanding to a specific deal that made sense is what has to happen. In terms of what type of blocks, we would think that the simpler product, the better the price, then the easier execution. One example of that would be fixed annuities, although I think there are other liability block sales that are possible.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on \u2013 if I could ask one more just on the Group Benefits market. Could you just talk about how the competitive environment is there? And as you've looked more into the Liberty Mutual block, what's your view of the overall block in terms of pricing adequacy and your ability to achieve the expense savings that you'd guided to previously?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, the Group market competitive environment, I would say, is solid. There doesn't seem to be anyone that's pricing at unrealistic levels. I think there has been a little bit of evidence that there's a little less movement in the marketplace, which means may be a fewer opportunities. But we're pretty optimistic, overall, about our sales across our markets; small, mid, and large, and we're having good results this year. With respect to the Liberty block itself, I would say that, as we discussed, they had started a repricing initiative some 24 months ago, and in terms of premium \u2013 excuse me, in terms of the results that they're getting on increases were in line and that's pretty good. And I would also say that we're slightly ahead of the persistency expectations on the renewal block. So, it's going very well.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Jimmy, on the last part of your question, we're very confident in our ability to deliver those expense synergies we talked about. As a reminder, we talked about $100 million. In fact, I think we'd expect to, over time, move a little above that, even though we're not going to highlight a specific number yet. So, we're very confident in our ability to deliver those expense savings. I think you're seeing those already, and I think you'll continue to see them into 2019, which should be very supportive of the margin. And over the longer term, I'd say those expense synergies are one of the reasons when you think about longer-term profitability in this business. We've always talked about it as a 5% to 7% business, but I'd really see us in the upper half of that range over time. So, yeah, feeling very good about that business, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi. Thank you. I want to focus a little bit on the benefits from higher interest rates. I know we typically focus on the impact of rates on spreads, but you're also seeing evidence that higher rates are boosting new business growth, I guess, most \u2013 particularly in annuities. And is there any benefit that you're seeing to your new business margins?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Well, the answer to that is business by business, but we have been saying now for some time that the biggest benefit of rising interest rates for Lincoln and for the industry is the ability to drive more value into each of our products. And Erik, as you pointed out, this is clearest right at this moment in the context of the annuity business, I also mentioned in my remarks that higher rates will help us improve pricing for the consumer in the Life business. And so, that'll be a positive. And I'd go on to say that it makes sense to get higher sales, but it also makes sense to get better results for the shareholders. And so, it's a combination of those two outcomes that we're looking for.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Erik, just to expand a little bit on the Life business, we had repriced our entire portfolio in a much lower rate environment. And so, just factually, if you look at the returns we're getting today, they're as high as they've ever been in the Life Insurance business. So as we reprice that entire portfolio into this new interest rate environment, I definitely expect that that's going to be supportive of a stronger value proposition for the consumer. So, feel very good about what rates mean for Life Insurance sales going forward.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. And given your strong sales growth in Annuities and the associated new business strain, is there any change in your expectation for free cash flow as we move into 2019?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, none at all, Erik. I think one point I'd make, we had very strong capital growth this quarter, up a couple hundred million to $9.3 billion. But you saw the RBC ratio still relatively flat, and that's really reflective of that strong annuity growth. I know when you put annuity business on in the first year, you tend to get large capital growth because of the first year contribution as a percentage of premium. So, despite that growth, we were able to maintain an RBC ratio because of the strong capital-generating capabilities of our business.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Great. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Could you give us some sense of where you view the run rate quarterly earnings for Life Insurance at this point?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Ryan, let's look at this quarter. We made $176 million. There are some things in there that didn't pan out we talked about, we had an unlocking negative of about $20 million. But on the other side, we had good mortality experience. I'd sort of match those two items up against each other. Additionally, we had good performance from our alternative portfolio. But on the other hand, and as I mentioned in my script, we had a sort of a one-time headwind in policy loan income, and I'd match those two items up together. So when I look at the quarter, $176 million, I think it's the number. It was a good quarter, feel good about it. Very reflective of where we should be in the Life Insurance business.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then, on expenses. At the Investor Day last year, you laid out the trajectory of your digital initiatives over few years. Could you give an update on that just in terms of 2018? Is it tracking in line with what you expected? And then, would you still expect the net impact in 2019 to be more breakeven?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, absolutely, Ryan. So, we talked about a range this year of $70 million to $80 million of benefits \u2013 of expenses, excuse me, and about $40 million of benefits in the businesses. Looks like we're tracking at the lower end of that spend range, but the savings are running right in line with what we said. And you're really seeing that. As I mentioned, in the businesses, you see actual outright decreases in expenses despite the fact that they're all growing.","So, spot-on with this year. And as we look into next year, very similar to what we said before, we should be more of a breakeven proposition next year. Beyond that, you'll start to see the investments trail off and the benefits continue to grow. So, we get to that ultimate $90 million to $150 million of net benefit to the bottom line.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great, thanks a lot.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. Just want to come back to Jimmy's question on the thought process behind potentially monetizing some of your in-force to buy back stock, Dennis. Is that because you see a big arbitrage opportunity currently? Like, you could \u2013 between the price you would get capital freed up, you'd get a double-digit PE. You'd be able to buy back your stock at 6 or 7 times. Is there a big opportunity like that in the market today or is it something else? Is that not the case?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Tom, without getting into specifics, it's the idea that we're trading at a low level, couple days ago, at $57, which is hard to candidly understand, given the performance of the company, combined with the fact that there is a better market for block sales that's been evolving for some time now. So to the extent that those two can cross over, that we have a low share price and we can sell the block on a favorable basis and it makes sense for our shareholders, that's sort of what we're thinking right now.","In terms of what are some of the other considerations, we'd like to think that any transaction we do is accretive to things like EPS, book value and ROE. So, that's sort of what's in the back of our mind. I think it's just \u2013 I'd characterize it as sort of another arrow in the quiver of opportunity for us to do shareholder-positive activities. But I'd say it's just another possibility and that my main focus and the management team's main focus is continue to build the kind of results on an ongoing basis that you've seen for the last five years, positive results and, of course, the best quarter in the history of the company to-date.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Understood. And then, just a follow-up for Randy. I know last quarter, Randy, you had said you feel good about variable annuity reform in terms of where you're likely to end up or where it's ending up. Can you comment on where that \u2013 is it finalized now? And also, any I guess quantitative or qualitative comments you can get about how the new standards might impact LNC.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Tom, our thoughts on that whole process haven't changed at all. I applaud the NEIC for seeing an area that needed to be fixed, improved, and going through a very disciplined process to make that happen. In terms of the final proposal, the things that we think are very supportive. I think there's a better alignment between your capital and your reserve calculation. I think the hedge accounting for the derivative instruments is very favorable, and I think the fact that the standard scenario is much more targeted.","Those are all very positive outcomes. Of course, there are some things that I'd prefer came out a little different. So, for instance, I think some of the assumptions in the standard scenario around policyholder behavior, revenue-sharing, those sorts of things are a little conservative, just as an example. But all in, this is a very good move for the industry, I think a very good move for the regulatory communities. So, I think it's a win-win for both sides. We're supportive, continue to see it not having an impact on Lincoln.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got it. So, Randy, no changes to cash flow or any of the metrics that you've been experiencing for that business?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No change whatsoever.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to circle back on the block transaction ideas one more time. Dennis, you talked about simpler blocks being more likely, but is there any thought to potentially proving out the value of some of the more complicated blocks that you have that are probably weighing on your valuation, be it VAs or MoneyGuard?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Again, everything's on the table in terms of what might make sense for the company, but, Suneet, I guess I'd be a little hard-pressed to say I want to sell this to prove the market that. I mean, we've got good results. The market's eventually going to catch up to the strength of each of our businesses. So, I don't necessarily think that would be a good objective for us. I'd rather just...","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then...","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understood. That's fine. I wasn't thinking the whole thing, I was just thinking pieces of it, but I understand your point. Separately, I guess on Liberty, now we've had two quarters in a row where the margin has been \u2013 the overall business has been above your target. So as we think back to the original expectations that you set out, can you give us a sense of what's breaking the right way? Is it pretty much across the board or is there anything in particular that you'd highlight with the benefit of hindsight you were just too conservative on?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Suneet, it's Randy. I think we're having very good loss experience. As we mentioned, persistency is running better than we thought. And as I also noted, we see additional incremental expense save possibilities as we bring these two great businesses together. So to repeat what I said earlier, when that all drops to the bottom-line, we had a normalized margin this quarter of 5.5%. As you move into 2019, we get incremental expense synergies that are very supportive of that level of margin in the 5.5% range. Even in a world where losses \u2013 loss experience would degrade a little bit. Should loss experience continue to perform at this very strong level, I think there's even upside in 2019 to that sort of level.","Over the longer term, once again, based upon things like the strong expense synergy outlook that we see, I see us with the ability to move into the upper half of that 5% to 7% range, which we've talked about for this business for a very long period of time. So, things have been running very favorable, Suneet, not too dissimilar from a loss standpoint from what you've seen from other group players. And I think there's a good opportunity for that to continue.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to confirm that as part of the assumption review that there's no changes for long-term care items around MoneyGuard. I mean, I think I know the answer to that's no, but also wanted to confirm that the sensitivities, Randy, that you had laid out in a prior call are unchanged as a result of the review this quarter.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Randy, the answer to that we gave before has not changed at all. There's a significant amount of sufficiency in the reserves. My recollection is there's about $1.9 billion. Even if you stressed every one of the major inputs in a very significant way, such as taking lapses to zero, increasing incidence by 25%, you still had sufficiency in the reserve. As part of the assumption review, I'd say, that was validated. So, inside of that Life result, MoneyGuard was actually a very small positive when we updated all the assumptions. So, Randy, nothing has changed about that product from what we've said before. It is a high-quality, high-return product with a great risk\/reward profile.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","And so those comments are in the backburner as a follow-up, going forward is, I mean, any change to pricing in the product or kind of how it's received in the market? I mean, I think sales are up a little bit this quarter, but that happens in normal fluctuation. But I mean, have you repriced it? When you think about distribution, do they look at that and other LTC products differently now that LTC's been more in the press this year?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","We're actually seeing a lot more entrants into the marketplace. I think there have been a couple more companies that have actually entered the space. So, you're seeing more competition, I think, as other companies realized that this is a very attractive space where there's a lot of consumer demand and there's strong return possibilities to sell this product. So, year-over-year, we did see a little bit of sales pressure and we repriced this product last year. The fact is, we repriced this product when rates were at an all-time low, which means that today, similar to my overall comment on Life sales, we are getting very, very robust returns and I think that will be very supportive of how we can think about any pricing actions that we take in 2019, as we once again look to reprice this along with our entire Life portfolio as we implement principles-based reserves across all of our Life business.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","That's great. Just one more quick one, though, on the new entrants in the LTC area, are they using kind of a UL-based product like MoneyGuard or are they entering with kind of more traditional protection products?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","I think you're seeing it all over the space. I think I saw an entrance actually putting it on the back of an IUL product. So, I think you're seeing it all over.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you. Taxes come in towards the low end of guidance and was actually below it in two of the three quarters this year. Now that we're almost completing a year post-tax reform, do you have any updated thoughts on where you see it longer term? And I get it can be wonky quarter-to-quarter.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, I think 15% to 17% is the range we gave at the beginning. I think it still represents a reasonable range. We're just a tick below that. I think we came in at 14.9% for the quarter. So, I think 15% to 17% over time still reflects a reasonable range expectation.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. And then a follow-up. Your sales volume has been fantastic. It may be a bit of an understatement. Clearly, there has been strong client win from product depth and breadth. How much of this lift do you think is coming from wage and benefits inflation from a strong economy? I know there's like a general concern that we're at the end of the cycle. Are you seeing any of that in the sales distribution that we are, or can you counter that as well, and show they're strengthening?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","John, is that a question specific to a single business or is that a...","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","No, generally.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","...broad.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Broad.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. I think the results that you're seeing in the Group business can be related to the \u2013 some of the lower loss ratios can be somewhat tied to a stronger economy. I think we're seeing in our RPS business more employee participation in 401(k) plans and a higher percentage of savings going into the 401(k) plans. So, I think in bits and pieces you can see the benefit of the stronger economy across our products. But it's sort of at the margin. I don't think we see anything really driving it more so than just at the margin.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Josh, I think your line is mute.","Operator","Please check that your line is not on mute. And we'll move on to our next caller. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. In Group Protection, you've talked about persistency being a little better than you expected, sales continue to be strong, and based on your comments, the strong economy is helping. So, maybe kind of when we put all of these into a top-line expectation, how should we think about the premium growth, at least for 2019?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes, a good question. And all the predicates to your question are correct. As we look into 2019, our premium growth is in part \u2013 not in part, excuse me, our premium growth is probably in the lower-single digits, the way we're thinking about it right now. And that has upside to it, because in that comment we're assuming some shop lapses that we haven't seen yet, but we continue to assume it. We get out a year or so and we're back to our 5% to 7% premium growth expectations.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, moving on to Annuities, you talked about the new relationship with Allstate and then also the expectation for the new kind of indexed variable annuity product being \u2013 you expect stronger kind of momentum to continue. But how should we \u2013 like while net flows is expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter, but how should we think about the net flows in 2019 as the new product continue to take shape and then with the new channel coming through?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Well, trying to predict sales for 2019 is something that we wouldn't ordinarily do. But just factually, if we see the kind of results from the Allstate distribution that we expect and if the growth in the indexed VA continues, everything else being equal, that would add 10% to this year's sales growth. And so, we think that's pretty positive. Now, those are just sort of the math based on our expectations. But it gives you a sense of how important these two relationships are.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Yeah. Yeah. Got it. I'm not going to hold you to that, but at least that's helped me to think about how to kind of think about 2019. Thank you.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Sure (52:27).","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Let's try it this time. Hi there.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Hi, Josh.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry. So, I wanted to follow-up on Erik Bass' question. You talked about the RBC ratio staying the same despite the growth. If we're looking out three, four, five years as the annuities sold without living benefits becomes an increasing portion of the portfolio, what does that mean for margins, for capital consumption, for fees generated on the overall portfolio? How are the moving pieces of the annuity segment going to be looked different, I guess, as we go enough years into the future given the composition change?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Josh, when you look out over a reasonable period of time, I think the metrics that you see inside of the annuity business, whether that's ROAs or ROEs, we expect to continue over the longer term. Yes, we are selling a little more in VAs without guarantees, which has a similar return, but a little lower ROA profile. But the reality is we have $139 billion of in-force, which is very supportive over a reasonable period of time, let's call it, three years. So, I think that we feel like the return levels both from an ROA\/ROE standpoint over the next two, three years are supported by that.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And on the indexed variable annuity product, as you enter the market there, do you feel like you're taking share? It's a growth market that there's room for everybody. It just needs to be sold to people and they'll buy it. Or do you know out there that there's people who would have sold another indexed variable annuity, and Lincoln was the one able to make that sale?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, I think the indexed variable annuity marketplace is growing, I don't know by what rate. I think just as every time we enter a marketplace, we get a pretty significant share in the annuity business because of the strength of our distribution and quality of our wholesalers. So, I think it's both. And I also think this is a very unique product, sort of a halfway between a VA product and a fixed index product. On the VA side, we have complete upside from the equity markets, and on the fixed index or fixed annuity products, you have a guaranteed floor of zero on the downside. And this is right in between. And I think it's a great product. It's being received very well, and I think it's incremental to the marketplace.","Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning. Dennis, I'm very intrigued by your comment about the block reinsurance transactions. You mentioned fixed annuities, it sounds like you would consider Life as well. Maybe you could give us a little color on potential size of a transaction.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Andrew, if I first could come back to \u2013 we knew we were going to get some extra questions on this on the call.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Of course (56:06).","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","And appropriately so. But I do want to start by reminding everybody that the model that we have in place, the results that we are getting, are things that we are spending our 100% attention on. But there may be a point in time where something makes sense, like the transaction we're talking about. So, again, we're focused on the future, building the business, that's job number one. To specifically answer your question, as we've thought about this, if we could raise sort of $400 million to $600 million, in that range, we think that would probably be meaningful. So, it could be different from that, but as we've thought about it, that's about what we're thinking about.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","That's helpful, Dennis. And then maybe this one's for Randy on the fixed annuities. It sounds like you \u2013 Lincoln has been very creative in developing new distribution relationships and that's probably the driver of the strong fixed annuity sales. But I do get nervous anytime I see an insurance company grow deposits by 130-plus percent. So, the question, Randy, is can you give a little color on the new fixed annuity sales in terms of the types of spreads you're generating, the returns that you expect on those products.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Andrew, I'm going to let Randy answer that question, but you've given me an opportunity to correct that maybe...","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","To correct something I said in my remarks. I said fixed annuity sales more than doubled to nearly $200 million. I meant to say that fixed annuity sales more than doubled to nearly $900 million.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Right, right.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","So, just to get that corrected. Randy, do you want to talk about that?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Sure. Andrew, one of the things that we did here recently is we split out fixed and variable annuity earnings inside our stat supp. So, you can actually see the earnings we've been getting on the fixed side. And the fixed business has been delivering very strong returns for us over the last five, six years in this very strong economic environment. So, I think that the business we're selling today from a profitability standpoint is consistent with the profitability of fixed annuities we've sold in the past. You know we did do a flow reinsurance deal with Athene, which has been supportive of returns on the fixed annuity business. So, yeah, I think we've been getting strong returns on our fixed annuity book and I think we'll continue to get good, strong, consistent returns on the business we're selling today and what we'd expect to sell in the future.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Sounds good.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Let me just add to what \u2013 broaden your question a little bit. We actually calculate every quarter the return that we're getting on our sales in each of our businesses. So, that's predicated on the mix of the business and just at what level your hedge costs are and all the things that go into trying to calculate what your new business returns are. And across the board, we're at our target expectations, across the board in all the businesses in total. And so, I wanted to mention that.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, I mean, Annuities ROE, ex-goodwill and AOCI, is over 20%. I mean is that the ballpark where you're seeing new fixed annuity sales?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","That's the result of the long-term participation in the market and staying in the market through good times and bad times. And that ends up with levels of return \u2013 has ended up with levels of return higher than our pricing expectations. Our pricing expectations would be in the middle to higher teens.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Perfect. Hey, thanks a lot.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference.

Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, liquidity, and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include those described in the cautionary statement disclosures, in our earnings release issued yesterday, as well as those detailed in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K, most recently most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and from time-to-time in other filings with the SEC.","These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this date.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call including adjusted return on equity and adjusted income from operations or adjusted operating income to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. Second quarter adjusted operating earnings per share was a record and up 17% over the prior year quarter. This quarter's results once again demonstrate our ability to deliver consistently strong financial performance, the success of the strategic actions, and the benefits of our diversified and attractive business mix. All of these have and will build long-term shareholder value.","First on financial performance; strong growth in adjusted operating revenues and adjusted operating earnings in the second quarter aligned with the track record of success that we highlighted at our June Investor Day. This includes mid to high single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share growth when measured over three, five, and 10-year periods.","Additionally, this quarter we grew book value per share ex-AOCI by 9% over the prior year period and expanded our adjusted operating return on equity to 13.6%. Strategic actions by management including maximizing our diverse product portfolio, participating in more market segments, and leveraging our powerful distribution franchise, a competitive advantage for Lincoln are accelerating growth. This resulted in strong topline results in the quarter which contributed to operating revenue growth in every business segment. This momentum will drive future earnings and capital generation.","We expect continued momentum as our sales pipelines remain robust. It is important to note that we have not only consistently grown sales, but strategically tilted our sales mix. Over the last five years, at least, 70% of our annual sales did not include long-term guarantees and year-to-date 81% do not have long-term guarantees.","Further, we have benefit -- benefited from our diversified businesses including growing our mortality and morbidity sources of earnings which are not correlated with capital markets. These now represent 30% of total earnings consistent with our target.","Within our capital market-sensitive businesses, we also have some beneficial offsets that help contribute to a steady source of earnings and can support EPS growth. We believe the business diversification is helpful to recognize, knowing interest rate levels and equity market growth rates change over time. For instance, in recent years, tailwinds from the equity market had more than offset headwinds from low interest rates.","Now, turning to the business segments, starting with annuities. Our strategic decision to broaden the product portfolio and participate in more segments of the marketplace enabled another quarter of robust sales as total deposits increased 22% and net flows were once again positive.","We remained focused on providing solutions that meet different customer needs and have the ability to help us sustain our growth momentum as markets or consumer preferences shift.","In addition to growth, this strategy also helps us maintain a diversified sales mix and risk profile. The quarter sales were evenly balanced between variable annuities with living benefit guarantees variable annuities without living benefit guarantees and fixed annuities. Strong indexed variable annuity sales lead to an 86% increase over the prior year quarter in VAs without living benefits. And VAs with living benefit sales accelerated sequentially following the market's volatility late in 2018 and into the early part of this year, consistent with comments we made on our last earnings call.","Our strategy of expanding shelf space and increasing wholesalers has resulted in fixed annuity sales momentum. Total fixed annuity producers increased 44% over the prior year and sales were up 46% as we generated sales gains in every channel including significant growth in IMOs and broker-dealers. So, another strong quarter for the annuities business, our formula for operating the business successfully is working, offer a broad range of products; invest in powerful distribution; maintain a consistent market presence; disciplined pricing, appropriate assumptions and operating an industry-leading hedge program. All of these factors position us well for diversified sales growth and continued positive net flows while delivering consistently strong operating results.","In Retirement Plan Services, our high-touch, high-tech, digitally focused model creates a competitive advantage in our target markets. This differentiated service model is driving higher participation and contribution rates and an increase in both employee and employer deposits.","In total, recurring deposits which typically represent approximately 60% of annual deposits were up 6% over the prior year quarter. Total deposits were down from a year ago primarily due to timing of first year sales. Importantly, our sales pipeline is strong and our latest product innovation YourPath which is our proprietary alternative to target date funds is providing a new avenue for growth.","Net flows were $307 million as we returned to positive flows after last quarter which was the first quarter of net outflows in over three years. Our outlook for net flows remains positive. Overall, it was a solid quarter for the retirement business. And continued investment in distribution, product innovation and improving the customer experience will drive both topline opportunities and bottom line growth.","Turning to life insurance. Product breadth and distribution expansion are allowing us to protect and expand our market reach. Sales in the quarter were up 30% compared to last year's second quarter. Total Individual Life insurance increased 19% as IUL term UL and VUL growth rates were in the mid teens and above and were complemented by solid executive benefit sales which can be lumpy.","Strategically, we are investing in select markets including the fast-growing IUL space where sales increased 79% and in term where sales were up 28% attributable to product and process enhancements along with growing our number of active producers. We continue to maintain leadership positions in VUL and MoneyGuard with each representing approximately 25% of our total life sales. We're using sales momentum and diversification along with disciplined financial management to overcome industry headwinds such as low interest rates and higher reinsurance costs. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the life business highlighted by double-digit top and bottom line growth.","Turning to Group Protection. Successful execution of our Liberty integration plan has led to sequential increases in premiums every quarter, since closing the transaction, significant expansion of after-tax margins and pave the way to benefit from the sustainable competitive advantages created by the acquisition. We are leveraging our larger book of business and expanded capabilities to achieve our strategic objectives including cross-selling additional lines of coverage and further penetrating the fast-growing and highly profitable employee paid market.","This quarter and year-to-date over half of our sales have been sourced from existing customers. And the percent of employee paid sales increased six percentage points over the prior year quarter. Our sales pipeline is strong with attractive opportunities in the large case segment of over 5,000 employees as well as down market especially in the 1,000 to 5,000 mid-market segment as we are benefiting from the best of both companies.","The group business has strong -- had another strong quarter. We expect to grow premiums by sustaining persistency and capitalizing on significant top line opportunities while maintaining disciplined pricing and achieving expense efficiencies. The combination of these factors make us optimistic that we'll continue to achieve attractive margins.","Shifting to investment results, during the quarter we invested new money at a pretax yield of 4.2%, 190 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. As highlighted at our recent Investor Day we continue the increase well within our risk tolerance our allocation to high credit quality, less liquid assets where we are achieving attractive illiquidity premiums.","These assets represented approximately 60% of our purchases in the quarter and we had ample room to grow these strategies. The investment portfolio is in great shape. And as the credit cycle extends, we have been shifting up in credit quality. We continue to diversify and to decrease our exposure to positions with greater risk of deterioration under stressed scenarios, such as lower rated BBB and below investment grade assets particularly within the energy and consumer cyclical sectors.","As we anticipate in the first quarter, the alternatives portfolio had a sharp rebound generating a solid 15% pretax annualized return. We continued to target a long-term pretax return of 10%.","So in closing, we're very pleased with our second quarter results highlighted by top and bottom line momentum. We recognize there is a focus on the market around low interest rates of being later in the economic cycle. Let me make a few points in this. First, going back to my comments earlier about the benefits of having diversified businesses and sources of earnings, the current strength in equity markets is a more immediate helper and has a larger offset than the current decline in interest rates.","Also the headwind from the decline in interest rates is gradual which gives us time to respond. And we have a proven track record of taking actions to invest in our businesses and simultaneously reap efficiency benefits such as our digital initiative.","Lastly, I would note the quality of our investment portfolio as we have proactively derisked the general account and have strong capital and holding company cash positions.","As a reminder we regularly stress test equity market interest rate and credit scenarios and are comfortable with our ability to handle significant stressors. So bottom line, I am confident we can sustain our track record financial performance and this was once again demonstrated this quarter.","So now let's turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported second quarter adjusted operating income of $478 million or $2.36 per share a record and up 17% over the prior year quarter. There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarters. However there were a few items that resulted in some variability this quarter. The net impact of these items was 0.","On the positive side alternative investment income was $0.09 better than our long-term expectation. However this was offset by two items. First was higher volume and performance-related expenses in part related to the increase in Lincoln's share price. And the second was modestly unfavorable mortality relative to our annual expectation.","Touching on the performance of key financial metrics in the quarter; strong sales, net flows and equity market strength resulted in all four businesses showing operating revenue growth over the prior year quarter with total adjusted operating revenues up 10%, boosted by last year's acquisition. Adjusted operating return on equity increased 50 basis points to 13.6%. Book value per share excluding AOCI grew 9% to $70.32 an all-time high.","And finally our balance sheet remains an important source of strength highlighted by high quality investment portfolio, solid capital ratios, significant cash at the holding company and strong capital generation which is enabling us to both invest in growth and return capital to shareholders.","Net income totaled $363 million in the quarter in part driven by below-the-line volatility from noneconomic impacts. However, as we expected the net impact from these items was significantly lower than the first quarter totaling $68 million down over 50%.","Excluding the noneconomic impacts net income represented 90% of adjusted operating income, as the VA hedge program performed well and credit losses remain minimal.","Now turning to segment results starting with annuity. Reported operating income for the quarter was $266 million compared to $275 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease in earnings is related to the reinsurance transaction completed with Athene, which reduced operating income by $14 million in the quarter.","Return metrics remained strong, with ROA at 81 basis points and a ROE of 22%. Operating revenues increased 5% over the prior year period. End of period account values totaled $134 billion, 2% higher than average account values, which should serve as a positive driver for future earnings.","Risk metrics were also solid and benefited from the growth in equity markets, as net amount at risk is below 1% of account value for living benefits and less than 0.5% for debt benefits. So, another very good quarter for the annuities business. Given that the tailwind from positive net flows combined with strong equity markets through the second quarter, we are well positioned to continue to provide dependable financial results.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported operating income of $42 million compared to $43 million in the prior year quarter as benefits from higher account values were offset by spread compression. Net flows totaled $1.5 billion over the trailing 12 months, which when combined with favorable equity markets drove average account values to $73 billion, up 6%.","Similar to the annuities business end of period account values are 2% higher than average account values. Operating revenues increased 2%. And the G&A expense ratio net of amounts capitalized improved 30 basis points compared to the prior year quarter continuing a theme of strong expense discipline as we leverage technology to drive down the cost of doing business.","Base spreads excluding variable investment income compressed 12 basis points versus the prior quarter consistent with our expectations. The retirement business reported strong results this quarter. And further momentum in sales and expense management should serve as positive drivers going forward.","Turning to our life insurance segment. Operating income of $168 million increased 12% from the prior year quarter driven by new business growth and year-over-year improvement in alternative investment income. During the quarter, alternatives were $12 million favorable to our expectation. This was offset by unfavorable mortality relative to our 2019 expectation for mortality experienced.","Underlying drivers were solid with average life insurance in force up 6% over the prior year quarter and average account values increasing 4% both of which helped drive a 7% increase in operating revenues. Base spreads excluding variable interest income were down seven basis points year-over-year, once again consistent with our expectations. So, a great quarter for the life business highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth. We expect sales momentum to continue. And historically our annual mortality experience has been seasonally favorable in the second half of the year.","Group Protection reported operating income of $68 million, compared to $45 million in the prior year quarter with the increase coming from the Liberty acquisition and continued favorable risk results. Loss ratio in the quarter was 73.6% consistent with the first quarter.","As a reminder, the year-over-year increase on loss ratios, reflect the impact of the acquisition, as we combined two blocks of business with different loss characteristics. Overall, business trends remained positive, which resulted in an after-tax margin of 6.6%.","G&A expenses increased at a slower rate than revenues, which resulted in a 50 basis point improvement in expense ratio compared to the prior year quarter. We continued to benefit from acquisitions synergies and are on track to generate $100 million of run rate savings by year-end. It was another excellent quarter for Group Protection with our pricing and claims management fundamentals performing well. These favorable factors should enable us to sustain attractive margins.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus stands at $9.4 billion and RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 430%. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $474 million slightly above our $450 million target. During the quarter, we returned $225 million of capital to shareholders, including $150 million of share buybacks. Year-to-date we have allocated $540 million toward buybacks and dividends, while continuing to invest in growth to support future earnings and capital generation, particularly through robust sales in the life and annuities businesses.","To conclude, second quarter results were strong and reflect many of the themes we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, including durable, dependable and differentiated financial performance measured by our sales momentum and operating revenue growth along with a 17% increase in adjusted operating EPS.","Investing in the business to support growth and returning capital to shareholders led to mid-single-digit growth in pre-tax earnings compared to the prior year quarter, and an 8% decrease in average diluted share count. And lastly, the balance sheet is well positioned and our risk manager framework is robust highlighted by solid performance from our VA hedging program. As we look forward, we are well positioned to continue to leverage strong financial results and driving a long-term shareholder value.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. Gigi, we will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, and then please re-queue if you have additional questions.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Gigi to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. A question with Dennis, annuities definitely have a very strong quarter in terms of sales. Looking towards, the second half, I believe the Allstate partnership is expected to ramp-up towards the latter half of this year. But given the interest rate outlook has your expectation for the sales contribution from this new channel changed from earlier this year?","Dennis Glass","We continue to see good potential from the Allstate channel. With respect to fixed annuities and interest rates, we have seen reduction in our crediting rates. I think we're a little bit ahead and I'm talking in aggregate not just for Allstate. I think we're a little bit ahead of the competition on that. And so that's why we saw a decline in non-sequential fixed annuities sales. But overall, we are optimistic about net flows continuing to grow over time in the total individual annuity business.","And then we talked about so much in our remarks, we're well positioned in every product line in every market segment. So there is going to be shifts in consumer appetite from one to the other, but we could take advantage of the shift, because we have a product in each segment and meeting every consumer requirement.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then a question for Randy, you talked about Group Protection you continue to see the expense synergies coming up and you're still on target to get to $100 million. But do you see any reason why you can't achieve the savings earlier than target?","Randy Freitag","Humphrey thanks for the question. I think we're pretty much right on track with what we said and that we expect to get to $100 million by the end of 2019. We're well on track to that where we've hit the mid-80s. I think we're actually 87, if you look at where we are through the second quarter. I think also Humphrey what we've said is that when we look into 2020 we think there's some additional capacity to go above the $100 million, we initially thought we can get when we entered into this great transaction. So we're right on track with a little upside to what we actually originally thought Humphrey.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks, good morning. On indexed VA you've had pretty essential growth now since you launched that product. Just curious about, how much additional runway you see for further growth there just given the market size of that product?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. We think it's going to continue to take share. It's a very \u2013 excuse me, it's continue to be a growing part of our overall sales plan. It's an important product in the marketplace. Consumers are reacting very well to it, and we expect continued growth.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then G&A expenses were a bit higher in annuities and life this quarter. I think it was partly related to the volume growth. But should we expect that to continue, if volumes remain at these levels?","Randy Freitag","Yes, Ryan let me talk about the expenses in total. If you look at the expenses in 2018 to 2019 second quarter 2018 to second quarter 2019, net G&A in total for the organization is up about $70 million. If you've broke that up into its component parts about a-third of that increase, would be the addition of Liberty for an additional month. About a-third of it would be really linked to performance-related items, primarily the change in the share price of Lincoln.","If you go back to second quarter 2018 G&A was actually reduced by $11 million, because the share price was down quite a bit while this quarter G&A was boosted by about $6 million by that same factor. And then the other third really represents normal growth, which is a little above where we've been for the last couple of years driven by exactly what you referenced, which is the very strong volume. So assuming performance and all those things continue to come in line, I think you would \u2013 expenses we had this quarter pretty much what we'd expect looking into the back half of the year.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. That's helpful.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is now open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. My first question is just on interest rate environment. Given the pullback in rates, do you still feel pretty good about where you're pricing new business particularly on the annuity and individual life side? Or do you think you need another round of the repricing like you did several years ago? Thanks.","Dennis Glass","We're still seeing good returns on the RPS life in Group Protection business. In the annuity business, I think, I've mentioned that we've reduced rates on the fixed annuities to get our returns back up to where they need to be and we're doing that. Again I think we're a little ahead of the market on. With respect to our variable annuity products, specifically with living benefits, we've dropped the guaranteed rate on income about 15 basis points at the margin. So we've taken what we think are the necessary actions. And depending on which way interest rates dripped. We'll continue to do what needs to be done to get the proper return on new business. And I don't think -- I think at the margin it might affect the volume of sales levels but we don't think the modest changes that we're making is going to have a significant impact on volume.","Randy Freitag","Sumeet on the life side -- it's an interesting year because unlike any year before us this happens to be a year where we were pricing 100% of our life portfolio because of the introduction of principles-based reserving in 2020 along with the transition to a new underlying mortality table 2017 CSO. So as we've gone through the year we've been able to actually reflect some of the impact of lower rates into the pricing of those products. Of course as we've got later in the year and rates have come down a bit that would be more reflected on the more recently priced products. But I would say we've been able to reflect lower rates in some of our pricing. That doesn't mean that there isn't a little bit more to go. But feel good about the returns we're getting across our life portfolio and what we've been able to do in the face of these lower interest rates.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just separately on sales we are reading of late some of the articles that have come out regulators' views of best interest standards NAIC reviews and like. Any comments about kind of where you think we are in that process and how you think it's going?","Dennis Glass","Well that covers a lot of ground, but let me talk about a couple of things. Most important items for us is that the best interest standard should include choice between fees and commissions and a level playing field for various products and service models. The SEC's final ruling package which included Regulation Best Interest created an enhanced standard for BDs, while preserving investor choice. So I think what's come out of the SEC is positive for our business model.","The other important regulation is the SECURE Act, which will give us opportunities when we think it will get past, but it will give us opportunities to put for example guaranteed lifetime income products within a plan. And I think it could be a great opportunity for growth for us. So I think the regulatory environment at the moment is moving -- has moved pretty substantially in our direction where it was or can still move there against SECURE Act.","States there was a little flurry of best interest and the industry has been paying attention to that. It seems to have slowed down a little bit. We'll continue to of course react to the state regulation. But generally, I would say regulatory issues have moved pretty significantly in the industry's favor and again if the SECURE Act is passed even more so.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. I guess either for Dennis or for Randy. I'm just curious to your life insurance sales even if I take out the executive benefit, which can be somewhat lumpy we're really strong. And they're really strong across essentially every product category. What do you think is driving that? Are you taking share, I assume up 19% year-over-year you must be taking share. And I'm just trying to understand do you think this was the blip or some significant shift in market share and you're aggressively going after it? ","Randy Freitag","Yes, the industry life sales are not up 19% and we are. So we have taken some share. We talked about this at the IRB. So we analyzed the life business and really with a focus on what we need to do to elevate the organic growth profile of the life business and thus drive more sales. So as we analyzed the market, we found some pockets of the business where we really weren't participating in the way we should have, specifically in the smaller phase term and in the IUL space.","And so we had strategies and like I said, we talked about this at IRB, specifically in those areas. And if you look at term sales, they were up nearly 30% in the quarter. If you look at IUL sales, they were up over 70% in the quarter. So we have the specific strategies and I think the team has done a great job of executing upon them. And then in our other products, I think you see more normal growth, just driven by investments we've made in distribution and products.","So we're very happy with the results, but those results are right in line with the strategies that we had for the year and the expectations that we had coming into this year. The only product John that's facing a little bit of headwind is the MoneyGuard product, which sales are relatively flat year-over-year. I think that there's a number of factors in there including the increased competitive environment.","There has been more companies entered the space. And if the second biggest player in the space had some price increases and that may have created a little bit of a fire sale on their side. So I think there have been some MoneyGuard specific factors, but we're very happy with what we see in the life space from a sales standpoint.","Dennis Glass","John I'd just like to add on to the Randy's comments a little bit and come back to our digital efforts. And if I can use small-based term as an example, we've made great strides in sort of digital app to digital issue and machine underwriting in between. So we're able to attract some more of the distribution that help by that so digitally. And we're seeing the digital effect across other product lines, but that would be an example of why we can take more share. It's a process in addition to product.","John Nadel","Got you. That's really helpful. And then Randy, if we could just -- just quickly if we could just quantify. I know you set on a net basis no notable item. Obviously, some moving part higher VII. I think you've quantified that as $0.09. The other offsets could you just quantify those and maybe identify where they resided?","Randy Freitag","Yes. So $18 million in total on variable investment income, which is $0.09 and that was offset by $12 million of adverse mortality in the individual life business. And then about $6 million of elevated expenses -- as I relate -- as I said related primarily to performance especially the change in the share price. So in total 18 of VII offset by the two items that I mentioned, inside of the most impacted business, the life business, individual life business that would have been $12 million of positive VII offset by the $12 million of mortality.","John Nadel","Got it. Perfect. Thank you so much.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of big picture questions. First, just any thoughts on your upcoming actual reserve -- actual real reserve review. Obviously, interest rates are a lot worse but than the equity markets are better than your assumptions. And I think you already had a question in your market corridor that you use observing and then also on the potential benefit of the SECURE Act, do you see most of the benefit in annuities or in the retirement business as well?","Randy Freitag","Jimmy, I'll take the first question. And not to sound like a broken record, but I'm not going to front run the process. There are a lot of people working across Lincoln as we speak on the third quarter unlocking process. With that being said and you mentioned it there are huge number of variables that go into the process, but one of the key capital market variables is the level of interest rates. And they are down quite a bit from last year, so we'll be very mindful of that as we go through the process. But we're way too early to talk about any overall expectation.","Dennis Glass","Jimmy on in plan protective lifetime income, we probably run them through the annuity -- excuse me through the RPS business, so you would see the benefit in the RPS business. It would be a joint effort of course we have as you would -- as you know have tremendous capability in that product line and so at the individual annuity business that's where the mechanics of it. So it'd be a joint effort. But to repeat myself, we probably run that through the RPS business.","Jimmy Bhullar","And obviously, I think the SECURE Act give you Safe Harbors to be able to sell annuities into retirement plans. Do you have any thoughts on potential interest from plan\u2026?","Dennis Glass","Yes. I think the -- there are -- there have been some products inside the in-plan products over the years. But there is a sort of fiduciary responsibility on the plan management people-to-people who brought the plan related to the solvency of the providers which goes away and the secure plan also becomes I think a qualified option. So it happens to be tremendously more powerful for the product and I think the lack of decline benefit plan in the United States had all the pressure on the ability to have secure source of income and the retirement is going to make it very popular. But, it seems like it should be that we'll wait and see.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Alex Scott","Hi. I have follow-up questions. The first one is on the SECURE Act. I guess, it sounds like there's an interesting opportunity there. Could you talk about some of the things that you can potentially do in terms of what would be -- should I be thinking about partnerships with maybe asset managers at our 401(k) platforms, but no annuity offerings? Or should I be thinking about you looking to potentially scale up your operation to take advantage in a bigger way from some of these things? Is there any contemplation of those kind of actions?","Dennis Glass","So, I think the biggest opportunity is just selling a protected lifetime income product into existing plants. Some of that opportunity will come from our own 401(k) customers or own defined contribution customers, because we have such qualifications in that product line or in that concept. I suspect we could go to plans that were not bookkeeper on. So, I just think it's a big opportunity in plan.","Asset managers, there are some programs that have been announced by BlackRock working with -- I think Microsoft to do this already, because there is a demand out at Silicon Valley to create these defined benefit type of opportunities, and annuity with protective lifetime income as retention strategies. So, I just think it's a huge opportunity. And protected lifetime income is an important product for some portion of retirees' assets. And I think it's just going to get bigger.","Randy Freitag","Let me just add Alex, as Dennis said the opportunity is very large to where it is. From a financial standpoint, this is not going to be what drives Lincoln over the next few years from a financial standpoint. That's going to be what we really have in place today. SECURE Act is going to be something that really is going to benefit the industry over an extended period of time.","Alex Scott","Understood. Maybe one follow-up, I guess back to actuarial review. I guess one of your peers adjusted mortality assumptions that ended up -- resulted in a charge, but also I guess materially changing the impact to go-forward earnings as well to some degree. I guess I was just interested to hear if given your concentration and interest in sensitive life if we have any risk there around mortality, and any kind of changes that you can potentially make?","Dennis Glass","Alex, it's really way too early for me to give you any insights there. As I mentioned, all of the assumptions get reviewed as part of the third quarter unlocking. Mortality is one of those there obviously. We have a lot of mortality risks, so it's definitely one of the major assumptions we look at. But, really way too early to give you any overall insights on what we might see for one. That particular component, and at the end of the day what becomes ultimately important is what do all of the impacts of all of the assumption changes add up to.","Alex Scott","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Dennis Glass","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. A few mortality-related questions as well the -- Randy, you mentioned the change in the mortality tables that you're I guess implementing. Was that this year? And what are those changes would you expect there to be any impact on cash flow or capital levels from that?","Randy Freitag","No Tom. So, this change is in the mortality table that underlies new business from a tax standpoint. So what it really drives is, what is the amount of cash that can be put into a product and still qualify as life insurance before you become what's called the MEC, and a modified endowment contract.","So that's -- so what the products that are going to be most impacted are really products that are focused around accumulation. Now most of our products there are more focused around redemption, but this goes into effect at the beginning of next year. All products will need to use this new mortality table, and what it is going to primarily impact is the amount of cash that a consumer could put into a product thus primarily impact accumulation-focused life insurance.","Tom Gallagher","And Randy, would that -- so for more accumulation-oriented life insurance products, would that raise the initial strain on it for statutory or is there some other impact?","Randy Freitag","No. It doesn't have much to do a strain. Really it's all about how much money a consumer could get into a contract is to qualify as life insurance. But it doesn't really have any impact on any of the other mechanics of the product.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. And then I know just on the mortality side after going through, I would say a good 2 year to 3 year stretch kind of no mortality volatility, you've had two negative quarters -- not hugely negative but modestly negative mortality quarters in the last 3. Anything that you see changing right now when you do your evaluation of what's driving that whether there's anything systemic or otherwise?","Dennis Glass","Let me talk broadly about mortality. I mean you've talked about last three quarters I've pulled it out a little longer. If I take the fourth quarter of last year and I lump it together with 2018, 2018 at the end of the day came in inline with our expectations. I think we ended up at 101% in my recollection.","If you look at 2019 we were 25 million to the good in the first quarter 12 million to the bad in the second quarter. So we're actually ahead of our expectations through the first half of the year for life insurance mortality.","I think the quarter-to-quarter numbers we talked about just say more to the fact that we're a large company. We issue a lot of life insurance. We have net debt benefits that run through our financial statements on any -- in any given quarter that exceed $500 million.","So the thought that you might be a little above or below that there's nothing surprising about that. But when you view mortality experience over a more extended period of time it continues to run, I would say in line with our near-term expectations.","Tom Gallagher","That's a good perspective. Final question on -- and anything -- I think in the past you really haven't had much impact from cash flow testing because of aggregation benefits. Given where we're at now would you still expect the benefits of aggregation of other businesses to sort of minimize anything you may have to post from a year-end cash flow testing standpoint?","Dennis Glass","Way to relate. Let me remind you we have very strong cash flow testing results overall. The only item we're really ever had to focus on are the subtests associated with guaranteed universal life otherwise known as 8C and 8D. We've passed those tests in the past and I think that's our best estimate going forward. But those are the two areas that we have highlighted or alerted you too that could create some potential noise looking forward.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. First a general question to Dennis and Randy. So what appears to have been a pretty solid quarter as you highlighted the stock is underperforming in a down market.","And so my question is, do you do an acceleration of share repurchases as you did back in the fourth quarter? Is there some business mix change that might make sense? Do you want to go out and do an M&A? Strategically, does this kind of prompt you to make a change? And what might that be?","Dennis Glass","Andrew I don't think we can react to a 2 hour change in our share price. Obviously we're disappointed. Some of the -- you all got -- you guys all do a great job for the industry which in remarks, whether we're off a cent from estimates seems to be the more of the focus this morning than the fact that we're up 17% with our operating earnings, and the fact that we've compounded our earnings per share for 12% for 5 years, the fact that we have one of the highest ROEs in the marketplace.","So our strategy is a good one. It's producing excellent results. And we can't be rethinking strategy because of one day. Now we are a little concerned about the multiple. And yes, we will look at every strategic option, although we don't have anything major in mind to try to get the market to recognize the VA business as better business than what it's currently been valued at we think.","I think right now, we're continuing to put up the excellent performance that we've put up. Again, I think sometimes we fight against some of the missteps of our competitors where there is some big charges or mostly for assumptions around policy older behavior. We haven't had any of that. We have an excellent hedge program.","So we're going to continue to emphasize the quality of the annuity earnings the quality of the book of business. And we're going to continue to emphasize 12% compounded range share growth, the source of earnings mix which gives us options no matter what happens in the capital markets or not no matter what happens in the capital markets.","So we think we have a good strategy. We have a great franchise. And as I've said lower interest rates over time will affect us, but we've got time to respond to it. Then I come back to our digital program. That was initiated for consumer experience.","But it also came along with $120 million of expense reduction, expectations and we are on track for that. And that was in part motivated by the fact that we saw interest rates lower, lost earnings from interest spread and where we're going replace it.","So we see this again a possibility and we'll take the necessary actions. But let me come back to, 12% EPS share growth for five years, 17% this quarter, 13.6% ROE improvement, 8% or 9% increase in book value. Hopefully, the market will react to that more so than, it has.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it, and I meant valuation as well Dennis\u2026","Dennis Glass","Yeah.","Andrew Kligerman","\u2026It sounds like you have a real confidence in the strategy that you're pursuing.","Dennis Glass","Yeah.","Andrew Kligerman","Maybe more technically, so looking at normalized spreads as reported, they did come down in retirement. But then interestingly, they came up in the annuity line. Is there any guidance or indication of where you see spreads going over the next year or two in both segments? Do you see pressure in both?","Randy Freitag","Hey! Andrew. Thanks for the question. I think that, what we did this quarter is, we did a really good job of making sure that all of our cash was fully invested. And you see that have a positive impact on the overall spread.","I think any number between 165 and 175 is well within, our range of expectations. And is really reflective of primarily what I just talked about, are we able to get the cash that comes into that business, especially as it runs through like the hedge program? Or are we able to get that cash invested on a timely basis?","Andrew Kligerman","Got it, thank you.","Randy Freitag","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","John Barnidge","Thank you. My question is about retirement. First year sales were a bit light. This is more a function of timing or demand. And maybe can you please talk about the backlog in the second half of the year?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. I think, it's exactly what you said timing. We have a very robust pipeline in both, the small-market sales and mid- to large. Now we had to convert that pipeline into sales.","But we're starting with a robust pipeline. So, we expect better sales results in the second half. We're seeing some of that already.","John Barnidge","Can you maybe talk about what sectors are seeing greater demand than others?","Dennis Glass","I think in the mid- to large market we focus on government, we focus on health care, we focus on education. So those would be the sectors where most of the pipeline is. And then in small case market, which we sell through predominantly the wire houses, we're seeing a pickup in opportunity there as well.","I also come back to the point I made earlier John, which is we're seeing 6% growth in recurring deposits, which is about 50% of total deposits in any particular year. So that is a strong balance and again pipeline opportunity is pretty good at this moment. We've got converted into sales and we're pretty confident that it'll happen.","John Barnidge","Great, thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Josh Shanker","Yeah thank you and good morning everybody. Two quickies, one, I saw a pretty big jump maybe over $1 billion in terms of investments in mortgage loans. As interest rates have come down is there pivot going on there? Is there -- are you adjusting strategy a little bit? What am I looking at?","Dennis Glass","That's part of the investment in less liquid, but higher-quality assets. I will tell you that I saw a statistic yesterday where we were going through some of the numbers. And I think we have worth -- $14 billion worth of commercial loans.","And we have more loans with a face amount of less than $1 million that are a couple of months beyond our payment. So, that's just an example of how strong our portfolio is.","But very definitely increasing our mortgage loan portfolio which -- with very high quality results. And that's statistics I gave you, a great example of that, continues to be an emphasis for us.","Josh Shanker","And I mean there was really a second quarter change in the miring of it, should I expect that to continue to accelerate going forward?","Dennis Glass","The origination in mortgage loans is -- again it's lumpy. And so, I'm going to just come back to my point that, we have a strategy to increase the size of that portfolio in a quarter.","It might not have originations and other quarters, we might have more. But I think the more important point is longer-term, that's a great asset class. And we're going the size of it.","Josh Shanker","And the second question, I apologize if you've already mentioned it. Did the drop in dental premium -- or dental sales I should say, is that seasonal? Is that a change in a large customer? What's happening there?","Dennis Glass","First of all, just remember that that is a very important product for some segments. And particularly in the 100 to 1000 employees segment dental is bundled with other products. So you have to have a good competitive product. The product in the mid to large size -- large case size you have to -- it's still important, but sort of, it's not sort of as much on the bundled basis.","So the decline in sales has to do with some rated cases in the larger case market and we're getting our profitability expectations and so it will go. There is a couple of other technical things in the marketplace that contributed to that, but let me come back to strategy and importance.","Dental remains important to us and it's a volume business. You have to have scale in it and so with a bigger opportunity we have in the larger combined companies will continue to stress the importance of that and I think over time increase balance sales and profitability which at the moment is sort of pretty minimal for that line.","Josh Shanker","And in that regard should we expect that you might be not renewing other blocks near term, as you're booking through the combined group business?","Dennis Glass","Could you say that again please?","Josh Shanker","Given the lack of profitability there would we see more sales decline as you try and reset the booking and get it right?","Dennis Glass","I am not sure that would be the case and again, I think, the longer-term issue is building the scale on that business to meet our needs over time. So we're not -- we're focused on it, but it's a longer-term build to get where we need to be.","Josh Shanker","Thank you for running over and taking my question. I appreciate it.","Dennis Glass","Thank you. ","Operator","We will be able follow-up with those on the queue later this afternoon. I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Jim Sjoreen. Please go ahead sir.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations and liquidity and capital resources, are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Form 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Overall, it was another very good quarter for us, with our results driven by an earnings mix benefiting from strong net flows, growing equity markets and somewhat higher interest rates.","We ended the quarter with the operating return on equity just under 13%. And compared to the prior year quarter, normalized income from operations was up 13%, 18% on a per-share basis, and operating revenue growth was up approximately 6%. These results are being supported by key actions. First, prompted by low interest rates, we began actively repricing our products 24 months ago to raise expected new business returns. With few exceptions, our current product offerings are achieving at or above our target returns. Second, equity base margins are benefiting from strong cash flows and rising equity markets. And we are being rewarded now for our consistent market presence since the crisis. Third, increasing shelf space and distribution partnerships, along with the robust solution set, have elevated our availability to sell products on our terms. And finally, aggressive share repurchases, totaling $1.4 billion since 2009, continue to boost operating earnings and book value per share. We'll take similar key actions in the near term. I will touch on many of these as I move through business lines results, starting now with Individual Life.","Third quarter sales in Individual Life were up 46% from the prior year. Sales are at pre-Pivot levels and are driven by a broad solution set offered to the marketplace through powerful distribution. Pivot products, which are more profitable and have a more balanced risk profile, were up significantly from last year. These products now comprise 63% of total life sales. Also, 80% of third quarter production is from products other than guaranteed universal life. Over the past 24 months, we have implemented the major repricing actions required to meet our targeted returns of 12% to 15% on new business. A new version of MoneyGuard will be rolled out in early 2014 and completes our major individual product repricing actions. Looking forward, product development will continue to reflect a broad portfolio of solutions to meet customer needs, diversifying risk and managing to excellent returns.","In our Annuity business, it was another outstanding quarter. Annuity sales of $3.6 billion, up 36% from the year-ago quarter, driving net flows of $1.2 billion. Our comp values increased 15% from the year-ago quarter, reaching $109 billion.","VA sales in the third quarter were $3.4 billion, down from the second quarter, as anticipated. With new business profitability above target of 15% to 18%, we have sharpened our focus on risk diversification through benefit changes, living benefit risk sharing, reinsurance and redirecting wholesalers to focus more on non-guaranteed sales. One tangible result is that, in the quarter, 13% of our variable annuity deposits had no living benefit guarantees at all, up from 9% in the second quarter. We expect this trend to continue as we both direct sales efforts and add non-guaranteed product solutions.","We reported last night that we entered into a 50% reinsurance treaty, covering new sales of our most popular VA living benefit. We will seed up to $4 billion of living benefit risk on sales starting in November to Union Hamilton Re, a subsidiary of Wells Fargo. The profitability on the reinsured sales after reinsurance costs remains well above our target returns. This is a significant transaction for us, which underscores our leadership in the VA market and commitment to risk diversification, as well as selling high-ROE products on our terms and in the right amounts.","Turning to Group Protection. Sales growth in both our core and voluntary segments has been supported by the addition of brokers and new products. Worksite sales, a part of voluntary results, are being driven by third-party enrollment firms and traditional brokers. The goals of expanding shelf space and partnered distribution are working in Group, as it does in our other business lines. Reflecting this product progress, third quarter sales of $107 million increased 10% from the prior quarter. In the voluntary segment, sales increased by 11%.","While we have been successful in achieving price increases throughout the year, we intend to push even harder on both renewal and new business pricing as we close 2013 and move into 2014. Our improved product offering and distribution strength better positions us to raise prices. And we remain focused on meaningfully improving our ROEs over the next 24 months. As we move forward with an eye on achieving stronger renewal rates and new business prices and maintaining consistency, we expect to produce solid results that enable us to deliver on our strategy for accelerated profitable growth in the Group business.","Moving to Retirement Plan Services, it was another solid quarter as well. Leading indicators were highlighted by strong total deposits and solid retention, resulting in another quarter of positive net flows. Third quarter deposits, $1.9 billion, were up 8% from a year ago, driven once again by sales momentum in the mid\/large market. Total withdrawals in the quarter were $1.6 billion and are elevated compared to the prior year. This reflects the lumpiness, primarily in the mid\/large market. Net flows of $219 million helped move account values to a record-high $49 billion at September 30, up 14% from a year ago. Moving forward, our ability to grow Retirement business will be fueled by our focus on the fastest-growing markets, such as health care and government, that are aligned with our high-touch value proposition and have attractive profitability characteristics. We have made meaningful progress in growing our presence in the mid\/large market segment, and we expect that to continue. We foresee similar success in the small case market, where we'll be adding wholesalers to support already-expanded shelf space with our strategic partners.","Turning to Distribution, it was another excellent quarter for our retail, wholesale and worksite sales teams. They remain instrumental in our ability to drive our core strategies. Our strong, flexible distribution franchise, as you see again this quarter, has enabled us to maintain a diversified sales mix and attractive return successfully pivot between products and keep pace with increased consumer demand to what we sell.","Through our Wholesale Distribution Lincoln financial distributors, we continue to grow the base of producers choosing to sell Lincoln products, up 15% from a year ago. With an eye towards maximizing the value of our model, our cross-sell initiative, which is focused on influencing producers to sell multiple Lincoln products, continues to gain traction, increasing the number of producers with multiple product sales by 14%.","Highlighting our retail distribution, Lincoln Financial Network, we are investing in capabilities that will allow us to attract and retain advisors, as well as enhance their productivity. This group continues to drive sales of Lincoln product leading the way in our Pivot strategy.","Simultaneously, investment product revenues and assets under management are delivering solid growth. Advisors -- advisor recruiting remains strong, with 220 advisors choosing to move their practice to Lincoln over the last 12 months. You've heard me say this today, but Distribution is a differentiating strength for Lincoln, and we will keep making strategic investments as we look to enhance a footprint that already includes 8,400 advisors affiliated through LFN, 580 wholesalers in LFD and some 4 -- 540 representatives within our worksite teams.","Spending a minute on Investment Management, with average quarter-over-quarter treasury rates up, we've put $2.4 billion of new money to work at a gross yield of 4.65%, up more than 80 basis points from our average new money yield in the first half of the year. The 4.65% investment yield is within 60 basis point of our portfolio's fixed income yield, easing the investment spread compression we have then experienced and maintaining our overall portfolio yield at its second quarter level. We continue to find value in yield-enhancing assets, investing $260 million this quarter at a gross yield of 5.8% and select strategies, such as direct private placements, real estate mezzanine debt and middle-market loans that further supported our new money purchase yields during the quarter. We also continue to commit capital to our alternatives program, both private equity and hedge funds, and we expect to achieve commensurate investment income aligned with our fresh commitments over the longer term.","Let me close by saying once again that it was an excellent quarter reported results, with good progress made on delivering the strategies that drive the success of our franchise. Looking ahead, our ability to execute those strategies, combined with expected tailwinds of rising interest rates, strong equity markets and a consumer appetite for certainty, position Lincoln well for the future.","With that, let me turn things over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $367 million or $1.34 per share for the third quarter, up 6% from the third quarter of 2012. There are a lot of things to like about this quarter, and before I dive into some of the details, I'll point out a few qualitative highlights.","Our key earnings drivers, including account balances across all businesses, life insurance in-force and group premiums, all ended the quarter at record levels. Our yields on asset purchases are reducing the drag from interest spread compression. We are earning strong returns on new business sales, and the balance sheet, with the statutory capital at an all-time high, strong RBC and net financial debt nearly at a post-merger low, is in great shape.","With those high-level points as a backdrop, let's dig a little deeper into the quarter. Key items of note include excellent top line performance, with operating revenue growth of nearly 6%, a continued focus on managing expenses, with G&A up about 2% on a normalized basis, account balances reaching the record level of $197 billion, net realized losses related to investments coming in at a very manageable $7 million, an 11% increase in book value per share, excluding AOCI, to $44.37, an estimated RBC ratio of 490%, $100 million of share buybacks and return on equity of 12.7% for the quarter.","As noted in the press release, we had normalizing adjustments of $28 million or $0.10 per share in the quarter, primarily attributable to our annual review of DAC assumptions and expense and tax true-ups. I'm very pleased that once again, when viewed in total, the DAC unlocking process had only a modest and positive impact on our results. It\u2019s also of note that the impact by segment was relatively small. Both of those points speak directly to the overall quality of the intangibles on our balance sheet and in our income statement.","On an aggregate basis, our variable net investment income, including alternative investments and prepayment income, was close to expected. Overall, another very good quarter.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter came in at a record $198 million, while ROE came in at 26%. The only item of note impacting Annuity earnings for the quarter was a favorable $4 million dividends received deduction impact. I'll point out that while this is of note for the quarter, it is not a normalizing adjustment when viewed from a year-to-date standpoint. Operating revenues increased 13% from the third quarter of 2012, as positive net flows and strong equity markets drove a 15% increase in average account values that, at the end of the quarter, reached $109 billion.","The annual review of DAC assumptions created very little impact in the Annuity business this year. It's encouraging that the changes made to our key policyholder behavior assumptions last year were validated by another year's worth of experience. Net amount of risk on living and death benefit guarantees decreased, and both, at end of the quarter, are less than 1% of account value. Hedge performance was again very good with no breakage, a strong, clean quarter for Annuities.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 6% benefited from an 11% increase in fee income as, once again, positive net flows and equity markets led to a 14% increase in average account values, which, at the end of the quarter, climbed to $49 billion. The interest margin for RPS came in at 2.03%, as the favorable impact of higher interest rates slowed the rate of spread compression in the Retirement business. Adjusting for variable investment income, I'd estimate that normalized spreads decreased 2 basis points from the second quarter. As a reminder, interest spreads have been decreasing 5 to 6 basis points per quarter prior to the increase in treasury rates. Return on assets came in at 27 basis points, within our long-term range of 25 to 30 basis points.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $140 million included $15 million of net favorable items, primarily attributable to unlocking. The unlocking results were not driven by any one item but rather reflected incremental changes to a number of the underlying assumptions. Life earnings drivers continued to grow at a mid-single-digit pace, with average account balances up 7% and life insurance in-force up 4%. Mortality was somewhat elevated in the quarter, negatively impacting earnings by roughly $6 million to $7 million, while the prior year quarter was benefited by approximately $9 million of favorable mortality experience. Reserve financings completed over the last year reduced Life's quarterly earnings by $3 million when compared to the third quarter of 2012. This factor, year-over-year compression and interest margins and the previously mentioned mortality experience offset the underlying growth in Life's earnings drivers.","Group Protection earned $23 million in the third quarter compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter. The quarter's results included approximately $3 million of net favorable items. The year-over-year improvement in the nonmedical loss ratio of 73.4% was within our targeted range, down from 75.7% in the third quarter of 2012. Nonmedical premium growth, which came in at 10% for the third quarter, has been consistent over recent quarters as the combination of expanded distribution and product offerings have expanded our sales footprint. Looking forward, while the overall economic environment will likely continue to interject some level of volatility into Group's results, we expect to see continued gradual improvement from the Group business as price increases on both new and renewal business benefit earnings.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few items of note. During the quarter, we issued $350 million of debt to pre-fund the upcoming maturities in early 2014. As a result, our holding company cap position of $1 billion will remain elevated through the end of the year. Strong statutory results boosted total adjusted capital to $7.7 billion, while RBC came in at 490% for the quarter. As you may be aware, New York has announced that they are no longer recognizing the AG 38 solution for pre-2013 business that was reached with the industry late in 2012. While the situation is fluid, based from what we know at this time, we do not expect that there will be an impact on our capital deployment guidance.","With $350 million of share repurchases through the third quarter, we do expect to exceed our beginning-of-the-year guidance for $400 million of capital deployment. This will be the third straight year that strong statutory performance has allowed us to exceed our guidance. This was another strong quarter of financial performance.","Reiterating those high-level points across the businesses: key drivers of earnings are all at record levels, higher interest rates are reducing the headwind of spread compression, pricing actions across the businesses have us earning strong returns on new business, and our balance sheet is in a very strong position. Those points, the points that Dennis made in his comments, in a gradually recovering economy have us well positioned to continue that strong performance as we look forward.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Randy Binner of FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I'm just going to kind of pick up right at the end there where Randy left off. On kind of the capital plan and buybacks, and I appreciate the comments on this New York Department of Finance issue not impacting your capital plan, but I guess what I'd say, in my opinion and maybe other people's opinion, is that you can might be able to do more than $400 million a year. So I guess the first question is -- I mean, there was $100 million in the quarter. That was a little lower than the first quarter. Are you holding back a little on what you might be able to do otherwise because of this? And is there any way to quantify what the RBC impact might be from this decision -- this potential decision by the New York regulator?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, let's separate those questions. We're going to meet with New York in the coming weeks, so we'll have more clarity when we -- after we have that meeting. SO based upon what I know today, then what do I know today, we're in a real strong overall capital position in total and in New York. We stopped selling SGUL in New York early this year, I think in the first quarter, and New York has indicated that any impact would likely be graded in. So based upon those facts, I don't expect any impact to our capital deployment plan. Now over to the capital deployment that we talk about and which we have been able to exceed over the last few years, the numbers are right in line with what was said, we've upstreamed to the holding company so far this year roughly $600 million, so we're right on track for our overall $800 million that we talk about sending to the holding company. Our holding company needs remain the same. Dividends are roughly $125 million, interest expense is roughly $275 million, which leaves us that $400 million. We came into the year with a little bit of extra cash. We're unable to use -- we're using some of that extra cash to take us over the $400 million that we guided to coming into the year. And when you move up going forward, we continue to look -- to leverage our balance sheet to hopefully exceed our guidance. But coming into any given year, we're going to continue to stick with that $400 million of guidance because that is what the numbers indicate coming into any given year.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. So the free cash flow, basically, it guides the buyback regardless of potential other buffer and a pretty high RBC ratio? I mean...","Dennis R. Glass","Yes.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But I guess, I'd reiterate the question. I mean, is this -- is the event -- I mean, is the outcome of the New York situation, could it affect RBC by 10% or 20%? I mean, does it have the potential to -- it is hard to see the impact from the outside.","Dennis R. Glass","Randy, we're -- this is Dennis. We're in the midst of discussions with New York, but I don\u2019t think we should front-run those discussions with any more specific discussion about the New York situation.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All right. I just got one final follow-up, which is important to this, and that's on excess reserve financing, and I know that's kind of implicit in the guide for the capital plan. So is that kind of -- we're getting late in the year here, so that's been kind of above or below or in line with the expectations for now and the rest of the year?","Randal J. Freitag","I think, Randy, in any given year, on average, we expect to do a couple hundred million dollars of reserve financings. And I think when all is said and done for this year, we'll meet or exceed that number.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Bass of Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just hoping you could talk a little bit more about the structure of the reinsurance transaction. And is the right way to think about this that it means that on the coinsured piece, you're essentially selling a VA without a living benefit guarantee?","Dennis R. Glass","Erik, I think the last comment is right, if I heard it correctly, we're essentially selling a VA without a living benefit guarantee. I think that's an accurate characterization. Let me step back a little bit on this. I have said, company-wide, we are gradually changing the mix of the sales of long-dated guaranteed products versus non-guaranteed products. Several years ago, this mix was 50-50. This year, we expect it to be 65% non-guaranteed, 35% guaranteed. So we're moving in the direction strategically want -- we want to do -- we want to go. With respect to this specific transaction, we're very pleased with the economics, and it's a good deal for both parties. To your point about profitability, the $8 billion reinsured block will remain well above our target returns and profitability after the cost of the reinsurance. So I think, this is a good transaction. It's part of a broader strategic plan, company-wide, as well as inside the Annuity business. And again, inside the Annuity business, you heard me talk about increasing the sales of non-guaranteed products, in part, by directing our sales force that way; also, leveraged by our ability to create VA products, to have as their benefit to the client more asset-based opportunity and not guaranteed living benefits. So it's just part, if you will, of a broader company strategy that we've been articulating. It's one tool. I think it's a very, very good transaction, again, for both parties, very happy with it, and it's part of this longer-term strategy that we have for Lincoln.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one specific question on the structure. Do you retain the ability to adjust the living benefits feature? Or are you locked in to the current terms through year-end 2014, so meaning to change either the roll-up rates or the pricing on the feature?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I think -- I don\u2019t have the specifics, but I think we retained, as we do with all products, the ability to adjust the underlying characteristics, subject to the guarantees.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just on -- Dennis, to your comments about shifting the mix, are there any other actions that you're considering to potentially accelerate the mix shift goals that you talked about?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, again, if you step back and look at the company in total, one very good example of this is in the Life Insurance business, where we've gone from long-dated guarantees representing 75% of our sales to now only representing 19% of our sales, 19% to 20%, so that's a big change. If you look at the emphasis that we have on growing the Retirement business, and you hear about billions of dollars of sales, those are all sales without guarantees, so that's important. If you go over to, of course, the Group business, we're accelerating the growth of that business, those are all sales without long-dated guarantees. So company-wide, there's quite a few things, specifically inside the Annuity business, reinsurance, products with value proposition for the customer that is not living benefits but is more high asset return inside a tax-deferred wrapper the way we used to sell Variable Annuity products, sales incentives, it's part of the broader scheme -- or, excuse me, the broader targets for Lincoln strategic targets, and we're going to pull as many levers as we can. But let me finish by saying that the business that we're selling, the VA business with living benefits, in this particular marketplace have very, very strong returns, and we like that business. As we go forward, we want to continue to grow our overall Variable business at a good pace. But within the overall Variable Annuity business, we'd like the VA business with living benefit guarantees to be at a slower pace of growth. Okay?","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. Yes, I appreciate your comments. And just the last thing, you didn't mention any in-force actions. Is that something you would contemplate as well? Or do you really see the mix shift being driven by kind of the actions you're taking on the new business front?","Dennis R. Glass","We've seen what some other companies have done on that. We've looked at our own products and our profitability, and candidly, we can't. It just doesn't make sense. We've got very good business on the books, and we like the business that's on the books. It's been well priced all along. And so I don't think we'll be tampering with contracts that are in place.","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Dennis, you mentioned like looking at it as selling of VA without guarantees, but it's a 50% coinsurance contract, so I'm just -- I think the right way would be like selling a benefit with lower -- or selling a contract with less guarantees but not without guarantees, right?","Dennis R. Glass","I answered the question, I thought it was with the half that did not...","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So if you sell a $1 million, in a way, you've only sold $500,000 with guarantees and $500,000 without that sort of benefit [ph]?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, right. But if I'll come back to -- my other point is that if you do look at it in total, it does have -- it being the 6 -- the $8 billion block, it does have better -- a better risk profile, and the ROE on that business is still above our expectations.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And as you looked at like -- as you looked at various alternatives and just the reinsurance option that you ended up choosing, what's your view on the availability of reinsurance or other solutions for like legacy lost [ph], whether recently written or written around the financial crisis?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, you've heard me say this before, but I think smart money is -- has been moving into this segment because of good risk\/reward opportunities and generally, as in this case, partnering with an experienced manufacturer. So we've seen different transactions in the past six months, it's my expectation that the dynamics stay -- risk\/reward dynamics stay the way they are now, I would guess some people would be more interested in looking at it.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on your Retirement business, you had pretty strong deposits, and that's been a trend recently, but your lapses picked up this quarter, so wondering if you think that that's more of an aberration or did you see anything that was driving the uptick in lapses, whether they were concentrated in the certain market segment or industry.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, it goes to my comment about this business is lumpy. It's lumpy on the new sales side because when you make a sale, it's usually pretty big relative to our overall sales. And then the pattern of how often people reprice business that they have with us now fluctuates from quarter to quarter. We win some, we lose some. But just in general, it's the lumpiness. I don't see any different pricing characteristics at Lincoln over the past 12 months that would drive sales one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question is from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Going back to that reinsurance treaty, can you talk a little bit about kind of choosing this alternative over other alternatives that were at your disposal, including maybe just shrinking sales altogether? And maybe touch -- if you could also touch upon just the pricing, which I have been under the impression that, for a very long time, reinsurance pricing on non-VA books were just exorbitant, so has that pricing come down a bit and make this alternative more palatable?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, let me once again repeat what I said. The economics, both to the reinsurer and to Lincoln, are excellent upon this or we wouldn't have done it. Said another way, our understanding of the overall liability and the price at which the transaction traded, again, is very positive for both parties. We will continue to look at every opportunity to diversify our risk across the company, as well as within the individual Annuity space, as I just mentioned, and we've made good progress. We have several tools, and we'll use those tools as they come about. But let me come back to why not stop selling the product. First of all, why stop selling a product that is getting exceptional returns in current market, and we just had that validated by some of our outside pricing consultants at this particular period of time as the pricing on the VA is as good as it's been. So the VA with living benefits is as good as it's been. So we're going to stay in this marketplace because we're getting good returns. The volume, as I said as well, we continue to sell and see the VA business volume grow, but the total growth is going to be faster than the VA living benefits. And finally, let me come back to the point about, I guess, just cutting off sales or, in some artificial way, reducing sales, that is so contrary to the way we run this business. We just -- we're not going to artificially yank a product or cut off 10 35 [ph] exchanges. We have to be in the business consistently. And we think if you're in the business consistently, the long-term value with your partners, the long-term profitability are going to be better if you're not in the business consistently.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one follow-up. You talked a little bit about the -- in your financial services the developments with the superintendent [ph] there. Could you also maybe comment about the June proposal, FASB proposal, and your thoughts on that?","Dennis R. Glass","June FASB proposal, Randy, would you take that, please?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Yaron, we commented we -- I assume you're talking about the new approach to accounting for insurance contracts, so I premise my response to that. We provided a response. In general, while we're supportive of FASB's efforts to come to a more converged system across the globe, we're not in support of the particular process described in the exposure draft, and we had expressed our opinion in our comment letter. So I believe that the approach they've taken would not be good for investors, it would not lead to a better understanding of insurer financial statements. I think it would be a negative in terms of sort of the metrics that historically have been used to measure performance in the insurance business. So for all of those reasons, we're not in support of the exposure draft as described.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups on topics you already talked about. Just on the reinsurance deal, just to make sure I understand the philosophy here, so we should not expect a change -- or should we expect the change in your appetite for Variable Annuity sales kind of going forward? I know there's been some concern on recent calls that maybe you're gaining a little bit too much share as some companies have sort of pulled back. Now you have this reinsurance deal. And should we assume that whatever the sales plan was for 2014, before the deal is going to be roughly the same as what it is now that you have the deal?","Dennis R. Glass","I think that's a good way to think about it, yes. So, yes, so we're not going to try to pump sales next year just because we have this plan. We're going to stick with our sustainable and consistent marketplace approach.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then, Dennis, you had said in your opening comment that -- when you're talking about product profitability, that most of your products are achieving your target returns. I guess, I'm wondering which products do you feel like you have some more work to do.","Dennis R. Glass","That was specifically -- the big product change is MoneyGuard in the Life business unit, that generates a lot of our premium, our sales, and so that's one example. And as I've said, the -- it's ready to go -- it will be ready to go in the first quarter. There may be much smaller products here and there that continue to need updating, but what I'm trying to get at is, on those products that drive most of our new sales, pretty much done with what we have to do. And I'd also add to that, pretty much done with what we have to do based on the yield curve that was in place a couple months ago. So as I look forward over the next several years if, in fact, interest rates rise, we're going to be beating our pricing expectations. Quite a different story during the last 2 decades where you had secularly declining interest rates, and you're always chasing declining interest rates and having to reprice.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then one other one on the new money investment rate, the 4.65%. I guess, my question is how much more capacity do you have to pursue these yield-enhancing investments? In other words, how sustainable do you think that 4.65% is as we think about the next several quarters?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, I think 4.65%, in part, had a little bit spike of up to 2.80%, 2.90%, 3% in the 10 year in it. So I think in the fourth quarter, we might be down 10 or 15 basis points off of that level. So that's the dynamic of what's the sort of underlying interest rate that you start with. There was no significant mix difference in the third quarter than what we'd expect in the fourth quarter coming from those higher earning investments.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one on this New York issue. I thought in your press release, you had cited the RBC ratio of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York as opposed to LNL. I guess, I'm just trying to think about -- as we think about this issue, should we be considering whatever ends up happening impacting just the New York sub or impacting potentially LNL as well, as well as the other subsidiaries?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, all indications are that this is just the New York sub. And we pointed that out because, I think at the end of the day, the New York sub will be able to handle any impact.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. I understood you. I guess, there's an earlier question about RBC impact, and it sounds like what you're saying is you're fine in terms of the New York sub, and we don\u2019t need to worry about LNL?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, I do not anticipate a major impact on the overall corporation's RBC. Remember, we ended the quarter at 490%, so we're in a very strong position. New York represents roughly 10% of the overall capital of the organization. So the vast majority of our capital sits in LNL, and so I wouldn't anticipate a major impact on the total capital position of the company. But clearly, the New York needs a little more capital that takes -- New York is included in the 490%, just to be clear.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. But I think you stated the RBC of New York was pretty high, right?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, was in the 5s, high 5s.","Operator","Our next question is from the Mark Finkelstein of Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to the VA question or the VA reinsurance transaction, maybe just a very specific transaction and how it will function. I mean, typically, with the coinsurance agreement, you kind of split the economics at the set percentage. So my question is this, are you essentially going to be giving to Wells Fargo the fee rider that you charge for the living benefit guarantee? Is it going to be more than that? Is it going to be less than that? How should we think about that?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, again, I appreciate all the questions around this, but, as a practical matter, we're not going to discuss the specifics of the pricing for a couple of different reasons: one, competitive, why would we want to share that with our competitors; two, in negotiations with a single entity, we're just not going to get into details about the give and take or who gets what and how. I think we're just going to stay with -- or I don't think, we're going to stay with the point that I've made a couple of times, the economics were good for both parties, and we certainly analyze this from the perspective of getting the right economics for the risk that we were being relieved of. And that, in total, after we pay the cost of the reinsurance transaction, our ROEs are going to be above our target ROEs for VA business.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right, well, thought I would try.","Dennis R. Glass","No harm in trying.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Exactly. I guess, Randy, can you just talk about the assumption study a little bit? You didn't do anything -- and I'm thinking more on the VA side here. You didn't do anything on the equity, you didn't -- it doesn't sound like you did much on the lapse. Can you just talk about maybe those 2 areas and what led you to the decision to kind of keep things as they were?","Randal J. Freitag","Sure, Mark. I'll remind you that in 2012 we made major changes to lapse assumptions in the Annuity business. And as I noted, a year's worth of experience validated everything we did, both to lapses and utilization. So there was no major need inside of those products, the Annuity products, for any major impacts to the lapse assumption. If you think about the Life business and across the company, we made the big change to the J curve, the long-term earned rate assumption in the other years. So that major impact was behind us, and rates are up some since then. So we made a lot of the major changes in previous years. So came into this year in a -- with an expectation that we're in good shape, we won't have major impacts. Specifically to the long-term earned rate assumption, we made some small tweaks to specifically the bond return component of the long-term earned rate assumption. I think I noted in previous quarters that our average long-term assumption was 8.6%. The changes we made brought that down to 8.4%, so we did make some small changes. I would also note that we did not unlock our corridor, so when you think about what is right now an immediate 14% drop in returns embedded in our DAC models, you have an overall lifetime effective return inside our DAC models right now in the mid-7s. That is a rate that is easily supportable, along with the 8.4% return assumption, by the way, by any set of long-term data that you can look at.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe if I can just sneak one more in, thinking about free cash flow a little bit, and we continue to talk about $400 million is how we start a year. And I mean, you're kind of pivoting to lower capital intensity products, so you are growing a bit, I agree on that. But you also have said that the free cash flow should grow with earnings. And earnings, I think you've grown better than most people are expecting. Why do we tend to go back to the $400 million as a starting point? Why shouldn't that number be higher?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, I think, if you think about the last -- let's talk about the last few years, which is when we've been talking about $400 million of free cash flow. You've got a lot of another -- a lot of other anomalous items that have come into the equation. You've got an AG 38 solution that's come in. So you had a number of these items that have come along which have impacted the free cash flow numbers, and I think that's why we really have been steady over the last few years. Looking forward, just as you said and I'll reiterate, I expect that free cash flow will grow with the earnings of the organization, and it will grow as we shift our mix of business to lower capital-intensive products. So that's in the future, and we'll talk about those items when we get closer to that future. You know we don't give guidance. So we don't give guidance. These things happen over time. They don't happen immediately. But I fully expect that free cash flow will grow as we look forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm going to follow up again on the reinsurance deal, and I wanted to see if you can talk a little bit about some of the economics. And certainly, there are a lot of strategic decisions for doing this. But if you try to compare maybe the differential, the comparison of the ROEs between pre-reinsurance deal versus the post-reinsurance deal, what would the differential on the ROEs be?","Dennis R. Glass","Chris, if we price the block, if we look at the block before reinsurance and then after insurance, the change in the ROE is 1% or 2%.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then we haven't really seen these really since the financial crisis. And certainly, I think a lot of your competitors are having to address kind of this deal today. But wondering, was it just this one reinsurer? Were there other reinsurers that were willing to share the risk with you? Do you think this is something unique to Lincoln, where the metrics that you guys clearly have shown is that your business is more profitable than some of your peers? What do you think just reinsurers, in general, are looking to get more involved in new business risk?","Dennis R. Glass","It's difficult to say, and this isn't going to be specifically responsive. We'd continue to see -- and I said it earlier, but we'd continue to see smart money coming in to the Annuity space. My view is in terms of just the balance of trade, if you will, between the reinsurer and us was as good as anything that's been done in the marketplace for the last -- well, since before the crisis. And I think that's in part -- it's, in part, related to 2 things. The math for VA business today, in terms of generating returns, is so much better than it's been over the last 3 or 4 years. That's one dimension of it. And the second dimension is, to the point that you're making, we do have one of the best track records in the industry for developing profitable business. We have one of the best track records for hedging this business. And so it's a combination of -- again, at this moment in time, good economics for everybody, people are looking for a little bit of extra return on their businesses, and doing it with a really strong manufacturer.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I totally agree. And then just one maybe for Randy. Wanted to see if you could talk to a little bit about maybe what the spread is of the living benefit rider fees that you're charging today versus the cost to hedge. So where does that spread stand today versus maybe 12, 18 months ago, before the capital market movements that we've seen and kind of the tighter risk parameters that you've been putting on the products?","Randal J. Freitag","Chris, yes, it bounces around, right? It bounces around day to day with the capital markets. But on average, I'd say you're running in the 80% range right now. So we charge 100 to 110 basis points, and the cost of hedging is roughly 80% of that.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then where would that have been 12 or 18 months ago? Would it have been similar? You've just been adjusting the fees to keep that 80% ratio constant?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, so we've been adjusting the benefit and the fees over time. There were -- there have been periods of time where the fees had been lower than the cost of hedging. There had been times when the fees had been quite a bit above the cost of hedging. But I think with the adjustments we've been able to make, we've been able to keep that sort of 80% ratio pretty consistently over time, whether you're talking about today, a year ago or 5 years ago.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question is just on the business mix. And how are you now? And, Randy, I know you mentioned you're going to surpass the $400 million of buybacks for this year. But as we think about going forward, how are you now thinking about the balance of M&A versus share repurchases, especially considering a desire to rebalance the business mix in some way?","Dennis R. Glass","Tom, maybe I'll take that question. And again, this may not be specific, but I'll start with saying that we build the business on the basis of organic plans. We don't look to acquisitions as a sort of ongoing opportunity to do things. So our organic business plans are directed in getting us to the targets that we're talking about. On the sales mix, we'll get there faster organically than we would be able to change the earnings mix to a higher mortality chain -- a higher mortality component. That's just the math. Just because it's -- math is math right now. So we're going to continue to grind away on an organic strategy to accomplish what we want. If a deal comes along that helps us accelerate our organic plans, we will, of course, look at it. And as you look at organic -- excuse me, as you look at M&A all the time, the litmus test is, given the risk of what you're doing and given the return that you're going to get on it, how does that compare to the return you're going to get by buying your shares back? Obviously, with the share price moving up a little bit, the debate there gets a little closer. But we'll continue with that general strategy and that general -- but generally, that's the way we look at things.","Randal J. Freitag","Let me just add, over the last 12 quarters, we've spent $1.4 billion on share buybacks at an average price of $25 and just a little over $25.50. The analysis when you -- based upon what we do, when you sat down and looked at it, whether or not industry share buybacks is a slam dunk, right, I mean, the expected return based upon our analysis was just world class. And that made the rate of return you needed to use in -- as part of any M&A analysis, pretty high, as the hurdle for other uses of capital is pretty high. That's obviously changed a little bit, but I still think that share buybacks, where we are today, trading right above book, represent a pretty good place to put capital. And we've done that, and we will continue to do that.","Dennis R. Glass","I'd also add to that, that you're not going to do acquisitions out of free cash flow. And so the guidance around stock buybacks comes from this holding company free cash flow. In any one year, we might have to take a harder look at that, but the ongoing free cash flow is more about dividend levels and stock buybacks than it is about M&A.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Now that's helpful from -- to hear both of your perspectives on that. I guess, the follow-up is to what extent is -- I get the comparison between buybacks and M&A. And Randy, I hear you certainly, 1 to 2 years ago, there was a pretty obvious disparity there. But to what extent are you also factoring in enterprise risk management from the sense that the volatility and -- if things go bad in the market and what better balance in your business would do? Because I think the analysis of IRR, looking at the ROE comparison, doesn't factor in volatility and enterprise risk. So I don't know if that's something that you've contemplated and how that would weigh in.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, let me differentiate it a little bit. I think what you're talking about, I would describe more as economic capital. Capital needs, when you look at various stress tests. Obviously, a key component of what we do as an organization when we think about our overall capital needs, you see it embedded when we talk about a long-term RBC requirement of 40%. You'd hear it when we talk about drawing that RBC down over time 10 to 15 points a year. So stress testing, driving capital requirements, looking at details, key part of how we run the business today. The broader topic of enterprise risk management is embedded in everything that we do. It's embedded in what Dennis talked about, the strategy of shifting to a mix of business that has a lower percentage of long-term guarantees. It's embedded in the product design that Mark and Chuck and their teams do on a daily basis. Enterprise risk management is a very broad topic that is practiced everyday in almost everything that we do.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one last question, just a technical one. Randy, I think you had said the -- for the Variable Annuity separate accounts, the new long-term return assumption is 8.4%?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, on average, 8.4%.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","On average. But if you consider the cushion embedded in -- on the equity side, I think that would drop all the way down to 7.5%?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, right around 7.5%.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So my question is, several peers have made that adjustment and then corrected -- taken the what -- in your case, it would be 8.4% down to 7.5%. And in your case, if you did that, it would -- there would be a neutral impact, right? It would -- I guess, the backward-looking gains would be offset by lower prospective looking assumptions. So why not just make that adjustment and have the 7.5% going forward? The only thing I can think, and maybe this isn't right, is that if you did make that adjustment, I think there would be a requirement to amortize more DAC going forward because of the way the accounting model works for future DAC amortization. But I just wanted to ask you that question.","Randal J. Freitag","Sure. Well, first off, I don't know the net impact on amortization. I tend to think that the net impact on amortization wouldn't be that large, one way or the other. Now as to the long-term earned rate assumption and the short-term corridor, I discriminate between those and differentiate between those 2 items. The long-term return expectation of 8.4% is linked to our view of what the market should support going forward over an extended period of time. And when determining what that number should be, we spend a lot of time looking at history, a lot of time looking at expectations. And I think in our analysis based upon, really, any long-term view of history, 8.4% is a very supportable long-term assumption. Now in terms of the corridor, that's sort of the near-term expectation of the marketplace, and that's why you have that down 14%. So I differentiate between the 2, I think the 8.4% long-term is very supportable based upon history. I think the corridor, we're well inside the corridor, so there, really, isn't a reason to unlock that. And I don't believe -- I haven't, once again, analyzed the numbers in any depth, but I don't see -- I don\u2019t believe you see a big difference in amortization coming out of either approach.","Operator","Our last question is from Seth Weiss of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question on the broader competitive environment of variable annuities, and you've spoken several times about the very positive economics of the annuity space right now, and I think we'd clearly see that in terms of rider pricing trending up, while features have tended to move less generous. And I would say, within the last year or so, part of that would probably be from capacity being removed from the system. If we look at smart money now coming in, in terms of this reinsurance agreement, as one example, do you see any risk of this favorable competitive dynamic, perhaps, shifting in the future?","Dennis R. Glass","It's hard to predict what market participants will do, but the trend over the last several years has been to more risk sharing of the risks between the customer and the manufacturer. The trends have been to less rich benefits in total. The people who were aggressive have left the marketplace. So I think there is going to be a pretty decent balance as we go forward. So I'm pretty optimistic about there being a good balance -- competitive balance.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Sjoreen for closing remarks.","Jim Sjoreen","Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning.

(Operator Instructions). ","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investors Relations, Jim Sjoreen. Mr. Sjoreen, please go ahead.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, operator. And good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's Second Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, income from operations and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to the most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call. ","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. Lincoln reported another quarter outstanding results, including a 13% return on equity and record levels of operating revenue, operating earnings per share and efforts on their management. Our strong performance is a continuation of good results, generally driven by strong sales with attractive returns, positive net flows, equity markets driving higher AUM and related fees, disciplined expense management, favorable alternative investment income and pre-pays and active capital management including $150 million of share repurchases in the last quarter. ","We also continued to make progress on our strategy to lean a little more towards the sales of products without long-term guarantees. 68% of total sales in the quarter were in products without long-term guarantees, up from 59% a year ago and against a target of 70%. We also upsized our VA reinsurance deal with Union Hamilton by an additional $4 billion, covering sales through the end of 2015. We did miss expectations this quarter in Group Protection. Randy and I will touch on group results in more detail in a moment. However, I'd like to emphasize that we have the right strategy in place. We\u2019re taking necessary pricing actions, and with new and strengthened leadership in place to address the issues, I am confident that we\u2019ll get back on track. ","Let me turn now to the business lines, starting with the Life segment. Sales of our individual life products grew by 7% from a year ago excluding COLI. These results benefited from continued strong sales of Indexed Universal Life, Variable Universal Life and Term, offsetting weaker MoneyGuard sales related to the rollout of the new product. We expect MoneyGuard sales to pick up in the second half. ","The diversification of sales by product and the returns on new business in the 13% to 15% range provides us with among the best risk return positions we have seen for the Life business. Also, our portfolio solutions, is as broad and competitive as it's ever been. We will take further steps to enhance our offerings to maintain our position as a leader in this phase. In the next quarter, we will introduce a survivorship version of our Indexed Universal Life solution. Other product development activities include a new retail COLI product, along with enhancements to our term portfolio later this year. Based on market demand in our enhanced product portfolio, we expect to see strong sales results in the Individual Life business for the remainder of the year. ","Switching to our individual annuity business, it was another quarter of great results. Total annuity sales of $3.6 billion drove positive net flows of $800,000 plus. Sales were down 15% from the prior year quarter. However, you may recall in the second quarter of last year, we experienced an outsized lift to our variable annuity sales resulting from competitor dynamics. We maintained our emphasis on increasing variable annuity sales without living benefits. 23% of the quarter\u2019s VA sales had no living benefits, up from 9% a year ago, and a change made possible by the size and quality of our wholesaling force. We supported this key strategy further in the second quarter with the launch of investor advantage, our new investment focused VA product that provides an efficient platform for account value performance. These actions continue to advance us towards achieving our organic goal of 30% of VA sales without a living benefit. When factoring in the benefit of the reinsurance transaction, 42% of VA sales in the quarter had no living benefits. ","Also supplementing our sales mix strategy, fixed annuity sales carried the momentum from the first quarter into the second quarter, with sales up 49% from the prior year. As we move forward, our view of the annuity business remains unchanged. The right volume of sales and the profitability and risk profile of new business continues to make the annuity business very attractive.","In Group Protection, we continued to address our profitability challenges. As I have pointed out before, we started implementing pricing actions in mid-2013 aimed primarily at our employee-paid life and disability business. These pricing actions are achieving mid to upper single-digit increases in both new sales and renewals. We will continue to make pricing changes as needed in order to restore profitability. Given the rate increases, new business levels were off in the second quarter. ","We continued to make inroads on our target strategy to further expand the employee-paid voluntary market. In the quarter, 43% of our sales were employee-paid, up from 39% in prior quarter. This is an important element in our overall strategy to achieve and sustain profitable growth in this business. Achieving this shift in sales mix, combined with ongoing pricing actions and strengthening our management team notably with the recent appointment of Dick Mucci as president, have us on the right path to achieve our strategic and earnings objectives over time. ","Moving to Retirement Plan Services, it was a strong quarter with improved improvements in both sales and retention, leading to positive net flows of $366 million. Second quarter deposits of $1.8 billion, were up 12% from a year ago, driven by a 27% increase in first year sales. Increased sales momentum is a direct result of the investments we are making in distribution and technology. We are expanding our small market sales force, now 25% larger than one year ago. ","Tapping into strategic relationships with leading distributors like Merrill Lynch, Wells Fargo and Ameriprise where sales have more than doubled from the last year, increasing our competitiveness through an enhanced service offering enabled by our new platform. These efforts, along with the broader and deeper relationships are affording us new opportunities with more consultants. Year to date, 44% of our mid to large market opportunities are from consultants who previously did not give us a look. ","Overall retention improved compared to the first quarter, the result of focused retention efforts including dedicated retention teams and enhanced risk reporting. We\u2019re happy with the progress we\u2019ve made and expect to see continued growth from our retirement business. ","In distribution we had another strong quarters well. Our broader and deep distribution franchise continues to be a differentiator, enabling us to grow sales and shift our mix when necessary. Our wholesale franchise, Lincoln Financial Distributors reaches more than 65,000 producers annually, a 3% increase from a year ago. In addition to growing, they were more productive, evidenced by repeat producers growing 4% over last year and a 12% jump in the number producers selling multiple Lincoln products. ","Moving to our retail franchise, Investment News ranked Lincoln Financial Network as the second largest independent producer sales force in 2013. We continued to grow our affiliated advisor base up 2% from a year now reaching over 8,500. LFN drives more of Lincoln sales than any other firm currently at 13% share and we are committed to making investments to deepen this retail franchise. You\u2019ve heard me say this before, distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln and we\u2019ll continue to invest in and tap into the strength of our nearly 1,400 wholesale, retail and work side professional across Lincoln who are telling our compelling story. ","And on investment managements, we continued to drive strong results while maintaining our portfolio\u2019s high investment grade quality. Our fixed income portfolio yield stands at 5.14% and our net unrealized gain is $7.5 billion or 9.5 % of assets, which the long duration of our invested assets is driving our increase in that dollar amount. ","Despite a persistently low yield environment, our new money purchases of $2.4 billion were invested at an average yield of 4.5%, 30 basis points over our average new money rate in 2013 with our yield enhancing debt program contributing 18 basis points to our new money yields this quarter. Our approach to the yield enhancing debt has focused on less liquid asset classes where yields and the quality of underwriting remain attractive. We also continued to commit capital to our alternatives program as we expand this strategy. We maintained the flexibility for further growth as well as benefit from its portfolio diversification and higher income yields. ","Let me close my comments by saying once again that we had a very good second quarter. I\u2019m confident that all the actions we are taking will enable us to achieve our long terms earnings growth, ROE and diversification objectives. ","And with that I will now turn the call over to Randy. ","Randal Freitag ","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported income from operations of $394 million or $1.47 per share for the second quarter, up 16% from the prior year period. The quarter demonstrates the strength of a diversified set of earnings drivers as account value growth in the Annuity, Retirement and Life segments drove stronger earnings than more than offset weak results in our group business. The quarter\u2019s earnings benefited from $11 million or $0.04 per share of normalized items, including $6 million in the other operation segment and $5 million in the life segment. ","In addition to record operating earnings, the quarter featured strong performance across most financial measures, including topline line growth with operating revenues up 8%, continued expense discipline with G&A net of capitalized expenses remaining flat with the prior year. Coupled with a strong revenue growth we saw G&A as a percent of revenue decline 90 basis points from the prior year. And book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 9% to $46.97, while return on equity increased to 13%. ","Turning to the investment portfolio, income from alternative investments was in line with our expectations, while income from bond and mortgage prepayments remained elevated during the quarter, primarily benefiting the individual Life segment. Strong prepayment income has been a recurring theme for the past few years, which seems to be related to the environment that exists today. While it is a difficult number to project, we will not be at all surprised and in fact would expect to see elevated levels of prepayment income should the current environment persist.","Realized gain and loss performance was a net positive this quarter with $5 million of realized gains on investments, while the hedge program had another great quarter of performance. And the unrealized gain on our investment portfolio increased to $7.5 billion pretax or over $12 of book value per share. ","Turning to segment results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $227 million, a 16% increase over the prior year. Operating revenue growth of 13% was driven by fee income which grew 24% as average account values grew 14% and the average fee assessment rate increased by 8 basis points. ","Negatively impacting revenue growth was net investment income which declined 5.5% as prepayment income decreased from an elevated level in the second quarter of 2013. ","Consistent with recent quarters, the ROE and the annuity business came in at 26.7% for the second quarter. The combination of strong equity markets, positive net flows and strong new business returns provide an excellent back drop for the annuity business. The benefits of that environment are evident in what was another outstanding quarter of results. ","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $39 million consistent with both the prior year and previous quarters. Revenues were flat year over year on lower net investment income while fee revenue increased 7% on higher assets under management. Average account values increased 12% from the prior year period and ended the quarter at a record $54 billion. Spread compression in the retirement segment remained fairly constant with normalized spreads coming in 9 basis points lower compared to a year ago and 3 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Management actions to alleviate the effects of spread compressions are helping to partially offset the impact of current interest rate environment. Efforts to lower guaranteed minimum interest rates over the last year have lowered the credit and interest rate by 4 basis points. ","Return on assets for the quarter of 30 basis points and a pretax net margin of 35% were again at the high end of our expectations, another strong quarter for the retirement business as asset growth driven by the strength of the equity markets offset the drag that spread compression is having on the business.","The Life Insurance segment reported earnings in the quarter of $148 million compared to $135 million in the prior year. Earnings drivers were strong in the quarter, with average account balances up 7% to $41 billion while Life insurance in force increased 5% to $629 billion. It was a very good quarter for the Life business, with several items contributing to the results, including mortality returned to expected levels after negatively impacting the first quarter by $18 million. As noted in the press release, earnings were positively impacted by $5 million primarily related to expenses. And the Life segment was the primary beneficiary of the prepayment income that I noted earlier. It benefited the segment by approximately $6 million. ","The Group Protection segment reported earnings of $2 million in the quarter, down from $22 million in the year ago quarter and $20 million in the first quarter of this year. Relative to the first quarter, earnings were negatively impacted by two items. Mortality was elevated due to the cleanup of claims related to unclaimed property. This one time item impacted the quarter by $4 million and LTD claim experience which impacted the quarter $13 million. LTD metrics were mixed in the quarter with elevated incidents, while severity and recoveries were in line with expectations. LTD incidents was driven primarily by more serious complex disabilities and more subjective medical conditions such as musculoskeletal and psychiatric issues. ","We continue to investigate the quarter\u2019s experience and as we learn more, we will appropriately enhance administrative capacity to deal with any elevated level of these types of claim. Our analysis also leads us to believe that the LTD claim experience is driven more by volatility than any trend downward in morbidity experience. For example, when we examined our incidents over the past few years, we did not see evidence of deteriorating morbidity trends and incidence patterns. ","Importantly, as Dennis mentioned, we are making progress on our plan pricing actions. That, combined with managing premium persistency to reasonable levels, and at the same time driving our business mix to the higher profit margin employee-paid and voluntary segments, are the right steps to restore profitability. ","Regarding our earnings guidance for the year, the quarter\u2019s results increased the likelihood that we will be at or below $60 million of earnings for the year, the low end of our guidance range. ","Turning to capital activities. We repurchased $150 million of our shares during the quarter, moving us to $300 million for the first half of the year, while statutory capital grew approximately $80 million over the quarter to $8.25 billion, with RBC coming in at 503%. ","During the quarter, we sent $210 million of dividends to the holding company, where we ended the quarter with $573 million of cash. The strong statutory performance and the balance sheet, coupled with the cash position at the holding company, put us in a very good position to meet or exceed our full year guidance for $500 million to $550 million of share buybacks. ","To summarize, three of our businesses had excellent quarters that overcame weak performance in the group business. And when you wrap it all together, it was another strong quarter for Lincoln, with topline growth of 8%, disciplined expense management with solid improvement expense ratios, continued capital deployment through share buybacks, consistent growth and strength in the balance sheet with book value per share up 9% and a return on equity of 13%. ","With that, let\u2019s move to Q&A. ","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","I just wanted to start with group protection if I could. Dennis. In your prepared remarks, you said that some of the changes that you have made give you some confidence that you are going to get back on track. How long do you think it will take you to get back on track? Clearly the year-to-date earnings annualized is going to come in well below that 60 to 80 and Randy made some comments about that. So what sort of time frame are we talking about here?","Dennis Glass","Suneet, great question. Candidly not entirely easy to answer, but let me give you some facts. As we talked about last quarter and I guess even in the quarter before that, we really have to re-price about $1 billion worth of employer-paid premium. And it's going to take somewhere in the neighborhood or through the early part of 2015 to get that all re-priced. And so the impact on earnings of that re-pricing will show up in the latter part of 2014 to some extent, and then into 2015. So it will take through the end of 2015 for us to get back on plan, or excuse me, back up to higher levels of earnings. It could be a bumpy road in between now and then because we\u2019re seeing some volatility as we\u2019ve reported. So I think it's 2015, sometime in 2015 when we\u2019ll begin to see some back to more normal levels. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","All right. And then you talked about the mid to high single digit rate increases that you have been implementing since the middle part of last year, I think. Just based on what you know now, in the quarter's experience, do you think that rate that you took is enough? Or could we be looking at another round of increases that is required?","Dennis Glass","We\u2019re going to monitor that, Suneet. And we\u2019re going to continue to make adjustments as needed. So it's hard to say exactly how much more we\u2019ll need. We just have to see how the earnings continue to improve, how our lost ratios change. So we\u2019re -- let me just say it this way. We obviously have a rightful focus on getting the right ROEs on this business. It's a function of premium increases. It's a function of incidence changes. And we\u2019re working very hard at adding the staff that\u2019s necessary to get that done.","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","I got it. And then just one other one for Randy, I think when you originally did the VA reinsurance deal, either you or Dennis gave us some high level comments about the economics of that transaction. Should we think about this new deal that you just announced, or that you're pursuing to be roughly similar with that original transaction?","Randal Freitag ","The economics of the two tranches are roughly the same. And as in the past, we\u2019re not going to get into the details of what those economics are other than say that, as compared to a fully living benefit sale without the benefit of reinsurance, maybe it's with the benefit of the reinsurance. Maybe it's 1% or 2% off our internal rates of return. ","Suneet Kamath \u2013 UBS","All right. So about in line with what did you before?","Randal Freitag ","Yes.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Seth Weiss with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I had a question about the annuity segment and the market leverage within there. Randy, last quarter, you gave us sort of a rule of thumb, 1% increase in the S&P provides about $7 million in annual earnings, and I think the results this quarter are very much in line with that kind of market growth. My question is, if we see the market come down, is the leverage on the way down the same as the way up? And the reason I ask because I believe you earn fees on guaranteed levels, not asset levels. So I would expect the leverage to maybe not be as much on the way down, or the sensitivity to not be as much as the way down. I\u2019d appreciate your comments. Thanks.","Randal Freitag","Sure Weiss. Yeah, you\u2019re absolutely correct. It's little less on the way down. That sensitivity to movements is going to increase as the overall account balances in the annuity segment go up. So our latest analysis would have a 1% movement, now having about $8 million positive increase on the segment as opposed to a 1% decrease having roughly a $6 million to $7 million negative impact. So there is a little more leverage going up, given where we are in the quarter, which is the primary driver of that. ","Seth Weiss \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. And just in terms of sensitivity to hygiene costs, hygiene costs have stayed low for some time and I believe that has a little bit of a positive bleed through on operating earnings. Is that something that we should think of as maybe a potential pressure if we see hygiene costs increase, volatility increase in the market? Or is the role on the hedge so it\u2019s not all that, you\u2019re not going to see that impact sharply in any given quarter?","Randal Freitag","Yeah. What you would see if the hedging costs go up is that the extraordinary profitability that we even experienced in our new sales and we\u2019ve talked about, returns on new sales have been in the 20s would come down. Now we don\u2019t expect to be in the 20s forever I would say. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see the margin you\u2019re getting on that guarantee rider come down over time. But we\u2019re currently experiencing strong returns, and we expect to see that for the foreseeable future I should say. So, yeah, over the long term I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see that margin earning come down. But for right now, it's very strong and we continue to get those same excess returns. ","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Jamminder Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hi, good morning. First, on the disability business, if you just talk about the success you're having in raising prices in the business. How is it impacting persistency and a couple of years from now, when are you done re-pricing the book, how much of the book do you expect to lose? And then secondly, just a comment on initial traction of the VA product without living benefit guarantees.","Dennis Glass","Let me ask Randy to talk about in a little bit more detail than I did about the timing of the repricing and then when that repricing flows into earnings. My comment was about in 2015 was more about timing of the repricing. Randy, why don\u2019t you talk how that affects earnings? ","Randal Freitag","Sure. So the total amount of premium that we expect to be re-priced in this employer-paid segment is $1.1 billion. Through the second quarter of this year we\u2019ve actually repriced $300 million of that. Now in terms of the earn to premium we\u2019ve experienced in the first half of the year, roughly $130 million of that premium has been at this increased level. Of the $1.1 billion, about $130 million of that we experienced in the first half of the year. As we move throughout this year, over the course of this year we will reprice in total $500 million of that $1.1 billion. And about $300 million of that premium will come through in this year. That\u2019s how you should experience. Then as you move into 2015, we\u2019ll pretty much complete the repricing as we hit the 1\/1 2016 renewals. So you should see about $800 million to 900 million of that premium effectively repriced inside of our 2015 earned premium and then it would all be repriced in 2016 effectively. Now in terms of the persistency on that, our historic persistency is roughly 80%. We\u2019ve continued to experience persistence roughly in that range and I wouldn\u2019t expect it to change in a material way from that. ","Jamminder Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And then on the VA","Dennis Glass","I\u2019m sorry. Could you repeat the VA question?","Jamminder Bhullar \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","On the variable annuity product, just an initial attraction of the new product without living benefits, because other companies have tried to do that and they haven't had a lot of success. So just wondering what you've seen so far.","Dennis Glass","We\u2019ve built the -- first of all we introduced it in June so we don\u2019t have any -- we saw a little bit of it, but not a lot of it. But we are very excited about it as a great mutual fund lineup. It has asset allocations imbedded in it. An important distinction from our competition is that it has an exit strategy, which is not a guaranteed exit strategy, but it\u2019s our eye for Life pattern which permits distributions first to be in the nature of principal and then cumulated interest income. Great lineup, good asset allocation tools inside the product and an exit strategy which differentiates us from the competition. And I\u2019ll come back to it again. The strength of our distribution is really powerful and it lets us make changes that maybe, well just that we can make changes. And let me come back to what I said a moment ago. Without any new product, we\u2019ve moved the mix to 23% on guarantee. I think we can get -- with a good product we can achieve over the next couple of years 30% on an organic basis. And as you know, in the meantime we have the benefit of the reinsurance deal to keep the -- we are actually ahead of our objectives on non-guaranteed VA business. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","Nigel Dally \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning. I have a question on interest rates and the sharp reduction we have seen this year. Randy, I know you're comfortable in being able to maintain your returns despite the low rate environment. In fact this quarter we saw some sold improvements. But perhaps you can also touch on how we should be thinking about interest rates given your upcoming actuarial review in the third quarter.","Randal Freitag","Nigel, you were breaking up a little bit so I\u2019m going to have to fill in the blanks on a couple of the words. But as you mentioned, we will be doing our third quarter actuarial study in the third quarter. As part of that we\u2019ll update our J curve. I don\u2019t expect a huge impact. Rates are relatively similar to where they were, but of course we\u2019ll update that as appropriate as we get there. But I don\u2019t expect a huge impact from interest rates or a large impact from interest rates this year. In terms of how interest rates at current levels are hitting our statements, it continues to primarily be an issue for the Life and the retirement segment. The Life segment is seeing its spread decline roughly 8 to 12 basis points or so on annual basis at current level. And the retirement business is seeing its spread go down about 10 to 15 basis points on an Annual basis. If you look at those numbers and what does that mean from a quarterly standpoint, it\u2019s roughly a $3 million or so headwind against earning with rates at this level.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR & Co.","Thank you. I want to ask a question about capital and liquidity and how that\u2019s related to buybacks, because so $150 million in each of the first two quarters has been good. And I guess the first question is just to clarify the $573 million of hold-co liquidity. Is that total or is that above your buffer that you like to keep?","Randal Freitag","No, that\u2019s the total. The targeted amount is 500 and we\u2019re at 553 as we sit here today. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR & Co.","So I guess, and you said you had $210 million of dividends that came up. So is that almost all of the statutory earnings in the quarter?","Randal Freitag","No. As I mentioned in my script, the stat capital grew by about $80 million during the quarter. Total stat earnings were roughly $290 million in the quarter. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. And so that\u2019s a good level, I think. Was there anything unusual in that stat earnings in the quarter?","Randal Freitag","No. As I mentioned we had a really strong first quarter. I didn\u2019t expect that level at the first quarter to repeat where it was roughly $370 million. But I think that $290 million number is a reasonable number. I think what you are seeing in there are a couple of items. You\u2019re seeing the growth in earnings, right? So you are seeing our GAAP earning grow and some of that should transfer through to statutory also. And then you are also seeing, and this is especially on the Life side, less strain given that the mix of sales has changed. If you go back two years we\u2019ve talked about a dollar of strain for each dollar of life sales. And that number is roughly $0.80 per dollar of sales right now. You\u2019re seeing the benefit of the mix change and part of that is flowing in to earnings also. ","Randy Binner \u2013 FBR & Co.","Okay. And then just kind of a final piece of that is the -- I think your commentary earlier in the year was that you were not planning on doing a reserve financing this year. I guess I\u2019d ask, is that still the case? Because previously it seemed like at least to me that you kind of needed to do reserve financing to get the full buyback, and maybe for the reasons you just explained, you have a little bit cleaner kind of cash flow coming up to the insurance -- up to the holding company. And so is that the right take-away and can we kind of hit the high end of that buy back without a reserve financing this year?","Randal Freitag","You answered the question for me. Yes, I\u2019m very comfortable with the earnings we experienced in the second quarter which support the share buybacks and everything else that we\u2019ve done. Now in terms of reserve financings, I don\u2019t expected that we will do one this year. The sales mix given its change with GUA sales coming down quite a bit, means that it\u2019s roughly in other year sort of thing for us from a reserve financing standpoint. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Just first question for Randy, any geography changes we should be thinking about as an area of focus into balance sheet review for 3Q related to either DAC or reserves, whether it\u2019s the equity cushion in DAC or interest rate assumptions? Anything we should be aware of?","Randal Freitag","No big things that I would caution or alert you to as we go into the process. We made substantial changes on the annuity side to the underlying assumptions around lapse and utilization last year and the year before. I wouldn\u2019t expect huge changes in those assumptions this year. The corridor we are still inside the corridor or the area where we would look at it. So I feel comfortable where we are there. So there\u2019s nothing in particular that I would alert you to as we go into the process.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then a follow-up on the disability claims issue. So Randy, you had mentioned you all had seen some more, what you described as subjective claims in disability. Can I take that commentary to mean that you are going to start emphasizing more claims adjudication and recovery, and focus more on sort of the scrutiny of the legitimacy and ability to get claims off the books? Is that going to be an area of focus going forward?","Dennis Glass","Let me try to answer that. Claims management is a big part of the Group Protection business. And as I\u2019ve watched it over the years, you see patterns. For example if incidents starts rising, the claims get higher, it may take a little while to increase the staff and train the staff in such a way that the amount of claims that are being approved or disapproved get back to where they should be. And this year Randy has mentioned that we\u2019ve had more complex claims. And sort of the same idea is that we\u2019ll have to upgrade our staff and move people into the areas that are dealing with these more sophisticated claims. So I can\u2019t tell you whether it\u2019s going to increase or decrease claims, but over time these things will even themselves out whereas in a particular quarter you could see more less claims than you might over a longer period of time. Hopefully that\u2019s responsive to your question. ","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, it is, Dennis. And then my final question is, just in lieu of what's happening to your own group benefits results and I would say several peers in terms of seeing some pressure on loss ratios, do you still have the same level of interest in the M&A? I know you've talked about group benefits being an area of potential focus. Can you give us an update whether this has any bearing in terms of reducing your level of interest in M&A in that area?","Dennis Glass","It doesn\u2019t reduce our long term interest in M&A in the Group area. This gets back to some of these strategies that we\u2019ve been talking about. Business with shorter term guarantees increase the amount of earnings derived from mortality and morbidity. Of course the Group business is right in the sweet spot of that strategy. I think when you are going through the amount of change that we are going through and by that I don\u2019t just mean the pricing issues we\u2019ve been talking about, but the shift in strategy, new systems, new people, building a stronger management team to deal with what has become for us at Lincoln a little bit more complex business, it\u2019s employee paid directions. So I think when you have all that going on you might be a little bit more reluctant to add on top of it an M&A integration. So long term I\u2019m still as excited of the business and the opportunity to grow it both organically and with M&A. Right now I think I\u2019d be a little bit more cautious about trying to add more complexity to something that is already complex. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much and good morning to everyone. Randy, towards the ends of one of your answers to a prior question, you mentioned an $800 million to $900 million figure. Would that be the amount of premium that was earning at the higher rate or that had been subjected to the higher rate but not yet earned?","Randal Freitag","That would be the amount of our earned premium that we experienced for 2015 that would have been experienced at the higher level of pricing. So it would be the actual earned premium that had been repriced. Now, when you think about that $800 million of premium, you would lose some of that to persistency. So you lose roughly 20% of that to persistency. And then the remainder comes through at the higher rate. ","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Now, the other thing I wanted to ask about was to try to reconcile your comments. Maybe they don't need to be reconciled. Maybe they were consistent, but I need some help about the disability business in the following sense. You\u2019ve talked at length in this call about how you have been and will be raising prices. That's typically done when ab insurance company expects morbidity to deteriorate or morbidity is proving to be worse than you thought and the business needs to be repriced. It\u2019s underpriced. But then -- and then around the same time you're talking about your pricing, you're saying that you're not seeing a downward -- I'm paraphrasing now. I don't remember exactly you what said, but what I recall is that you said something along the lines of you are not seeing a deterioration in incidents, a sort of deterioration in incidents. I'm not quite sure I understand the point you're trying to make. It's kind of nuanced I think. I would think if you're raising prices, it would be because you're seeing deteriorating morbidity including a deterioration in incidents. Can you clarify how these two issues, pricing and deterioration and the absence of a deterioration in incidents could be going on concurrently? In other words, how could you be raising prices if you're not seeing a deterioration in incidents?","Dennis Glass","Eric, it\u2019s Dennis. That\u2019s a great question and I\u2019m going to put it into longer time frames than a quarter. In the 2009, 2010 period, incidents was running lower in aggregate than it has since then. And so Randy\u2019s comments are more relevant to say the last couple of years. But we were pricing based on a lower expectation that we had seen for a longer period of time, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. They seem to have stabilized over the last 24 months, incident has. Again on a longer term basis we still see volatility quarter to quarter, but we priced to a expected lower level of incidents and so we have to reprice to this new higher level of incident. Does that help? ","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","It does. What I'm hearing is that things are worse than you thought. Why else would you be raising prices? But incident levels are stable now at a higher level than you anticipated, but at a stable level nonetheless. That's sort of what I am taking away.","Dennis Glass","Yes, that\u2019s right. ","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, thank you very much. That\u2019s helpful clarification.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of John Nadel with Sterne, Agee. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everybody. Just a couple of quick ones and then maybe a slightly bigger picture one. One, Randy, I think you mentioned that alternatives were in line with your expectations. Could you just quickly remind us what that was?","Randal Freitag","We have a alternatives portfolio of about $1.1 billion right now. And we expect roughly to get a 10% return on that and our returns in the quarter were right in line with that. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And then with the new $4 billion of capacity, what's the -- I guess at the end of June anyway, what's the total capacity remaining through the year -- through year end 2015 on the reinsurance program?","Randal Freitag","$6 billion plus. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Got it. And then the last question is this. I'm just wondering how should we -- how should I think about the excess returns on your new VA sales? You had mentioned consistently at least for the first half of this year, maybe a bit longer, that you are running in the low 20% range. How does that compare with the level, I guess you're actually baking into your pricing, if we assumed hedging costs do over time in fact normalize. I guess I'm trying to ask, how much is lower hedging costs contributing to the higher return?","Dennis Glass","Let me clarify the question about lower hedging cost. Actually the hedging costs that we are experiencing today are closer to what we\u2019ve seen over a long period of time with the exception of 2009, 2010, 2011 when volatility spiked up. There is no way for me to be able to predict if the current level -- the historical level of volatility which matches what we are pricing today is going to be future level of volatility. But that puts that into perspective I think. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. So I mean -- so I guess then, are you pricing overall to a 20% plus-type of ROE on this business? Or is there something else that's in at least the current environment favorable relative to pricing such that it's giving you some kind of boost?","Dennis Glass","No. The pricing today on our variable annuity product fully loaded with the living benefits products --- actually the total portfolio is at about 20% for the new business. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","And that's the target?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. John, nothing has changed in our approach to pricing the variable annuity business. You\u2019re not going to see us as the best product out there. You\u2019re not going to see us as the worst product out there. It's a good product that our top shelf distribution channel can sell in the marketplace today. So nothing has changed about how we\u2019re pricing variable annuities. So the returns we\u2019re able to get today are reflective of the same approach to this business that we\u2019ve always had. ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay, got it. I just wasn't aware that the market was bearing overall that kind of return hurdle for new business, but perhaps I was wrong. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Steven Schwartz with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open sir. Please go ahead. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","On the subject of variable annuity profitability, first I just want to make sure I understand something. On the new VA, there is i4LIFE but there is no GIB floor. Is that correct?","Dennis Glass","Yes. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Good. So then how do we think about the profitability of the new annuity versus the profitability of, I don't know, maybe what you sold last year that had guarantees on it? Obviously it is very profitable because the market went up, but just thinking about, it I would think more risk, more return, less risk, less return.","Randal Freitag","Yeah. Great return up into two areas. First year, return on equity. I don\u2019t expect to see a materially different return on equity between the non-guaranteed VA and the living benefit guarantee VA. Now what you will see a lower return on is a lower return on assets on the non-guaranteed VA because you\u2019re not getting that return on assets that you get from the guarantees. So that\u2019s what we would see with the non-guaranteed product is a lower ROA. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","And then I don't know if you said this or not, the operator came in and asked me my name or something like that while you were talking for some reason. On the employee, on the retirement plan side, Randy, did you talk about where gains were in terms of products, sales, sales growth in 401K or 403B, or 457? Did you touch on that at all?","Randal Freitag","We didn\u2019t, but we\u2019d have to get the detail on that for you. ","Steven Schwartz \u2013 Raymond James & Associates","Okay. All right.

","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Good morning, gentlemen. I had a question on the VA business. Dennis, you've executed very strongly in sort of growing out of some of the older more generous living benefit products a few years back. And part of that, you know, Lincoln very quickly adopted the managed risk funds and they have been a big part of your story. (Inaudible) Ameriprise commented, they had about, I think about $1.5 billion voluntarily move into their funds this quarter. Perhaps you can give us an update as to how you have been able to change the risk composition of your block. By how much you've seen moving in to the managed risk funds and if that's had a benefit on earnings. And I assume it\u2019s also materially lowering your hedge costs.","Dennis Glass","That\u2019s a big question. My recollection is that \u2013 and you were fading out a little bit there. Is this Colin?","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Yes, it is.","Dennis Glass","Yeah. Colin, welcome back to the business. We\u2019re happy to have you back on our phone calls. I think in terms of the risk protected funds, we probably have AUM in the $4 billion range. Excuse me. ","Randal Freitag","It's roughly -- the risk managed fund AUM is $20 billion to $25 billion. ","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","That's what I thought.","Dennis Glass","And what was the question though, Colin more specifically? ","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. In their earnings release, Ameriprise mentioned they'd had about $1.5 billion five moved over into those this quarter and it popped earnings about $10 million. My impression has been that Lincoln has seen the same very strong voluntary adoption of those types of investments by their policy holders. And I guess if you could clarify, is that the case and is that helping your earnings? And I assume that\u2019s also starting to make a meaningful reduction to your overall hedging costs.","Dennis Glass","The majority of our risk managed funds are coming from new sales. We did have some move over. We don\u2019t see a pop to earnings when that money moves over. But any incremental growth you\u2019re getting today is pretty much from new sales. ","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. And then one other follow-up, just Dennis, perhaps you could just clarify for this, for me, when you talk about the new products, and I guess from a competitive perspective, I assume you're referring to Elite Access and Jackson's product which really opened up the old annuity business that we maybe knew from pre-2002.","Dennis Glass","Yes. ","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Can you just clarify about what\u2019s different with your product versus Elite?","Dennis Glass","You\u2019d have to \u2013 that would be a complex analysis. You\u2019d have to go mutual fund by mutual fund, asset allocation models. We do have protected fund capacity or options inside of it. So the underlying investments that are going to generate the opportunity, Colin, will take a lot of work. ","Colin Devine \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay. I just think it\u2019s a non-guaranteed product. So I just wanted to understand what the difference was.","Dennis Glass","Yeah. The big difference is the \u2013 we think that our underlying neutral funds and all of the different asset allocations, to repeat what I said, are an improvement over what's in the market today. Obviously people could catch up with us on those issues. But we do have, to repeat what I said earlier, the exit strategy i4LIFE again, non-guaranteed but are patented, and Colin here is familiar with that as anyone on the phone on Lincoln for a while. So that\u2019s differentiator for us. Again, if I can come back to \u2013 we\u2019ve already moved the dial without a product that\u2019s specifically designed for accumulation from 9% of sales to 23% of sales. We\u2019re only trying to get to 30% of variable annuity sales on a non-guaranteed basis. So we don\u2019t need a lot more lift to get to 30% because we\u2019re already at 23%. So it's not just the product, but we think the product is great. It's the strength of our distribution force. ","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Bridget. Good morning. And welcome to Lincoln Financial\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln\u2019s website www.lincolnfinancial.com where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures.","So presenting on today\u2019s call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Operating earnings per share increased over the first quarter of this as we saw significant earnings improvement in our Group Protection business.","Elevated mortality in Individual Life driven by abnormally high claims severity resulted in EPS being roughly flat versus the prior year quarter. Excluding notable items in both periods, EPS would have increased mid-single digits.","Positive momentum in key business drivers across our four segments is encouraging and supports our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives. Let me quickly touch on each of these areas before commenting on segment results.","First, growth, in the second quarter sales compared to first quarter increased 9% or more in all of our businesses and we continue to benefit various product introductions and requirements.","Importantly, our mix of sales is increasingly diversified and returns on new business remained very, very attractive. We also once again generated positive net flows in every business, which contributed to total average account values being up 6% to a record $224 billion.","Next turning to profitability, we are encouraged by the earnings improvement we saw this quarter in Group Protection as management actions aimed at restoring profitability are beginning to gain traction.","Total earning progress was masked by adverse Individual Life mortality, but our positive outlook for this business has not change and I hope you will get a better sense of our earnings potential in a more benign Individual Life mortality quarter and as Group Protection continues to recover.","Lastly, capital management, our balance sheet remains a source of strength and capital generation continues to support active capital management with another $150 million of share repurchases completed in the quarter. We have put more than $2.5 billion towards buybacks over the past four years driving our share count to a post-merger low.","Now turning to our business lines starting with annuities, it was another quarter of great results as our high quality income stream continues to grow. Total annuity sales of $3.4 billion were consistent with the outlook we have provided in the first quarter.","Recall, we expect the sales to exceed $3 billion. Sales grew 13% from the first quarter and increased sequentially for the first time in the last year, a testament to our consistent approach to the market and our commitment to this high return business.","Variable Annuity sales totaled $3 billion and our strategic goal to increase the percentage of VA sales from products without living benefits to 30% has almost been obtained. This quarter, we reached 28%, marking the eighth straight quarter of sequential increase. When factoring in the impact on sales covered by our reinsurance treaty, non-guaranteed products comprise 59% of total VA sales.","An important contributor to this risk diversification strategy has been the very successful launch of Investor Advantage, our investment focused VA product that provides an efficient platform for account value performance. It is worth noting that in the first year Investor Advantage sales exceeded $650 million, marking another very successful pivot for Lincoln.","Net flows totaled nearly $400 million, more than double first quarter levels. When combined with favorable equity markets through most of the second quarter, average account balance increased 6% to $126 billion. All of which supported another solid earnings quarter.","We have produced a track record of consistent high quality annuity earnings. We expect this to continue as new business returns remain attractive. Demographic tailwinds still support product demand and we believe our disciplined approach to risk management combined with product innovation will enable us to respond to future changes in the marketplace.","Turning to Individual Life, we recognized though we focused on our second straight quarter of adverse mortality. We continue to view this as a fluctuation in mortality and note the underlying experience in each quarter was very different. Randy will touch on this later.","In terms of sales, total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $201 million, a 17% increase from prior year quarter as a results benefit from a large holy sale. Sales across our aggregate Life portfolio continues to achieve our 12% to 15% pro rate or returns.","The strength of our distribution along with product breath enables us to advance our product portfolio diversification including selling more products without long-term guarantees.","This quarter, no single product represented more than 23% of our total production. An improvement from last year and 73% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees, up from 58% in the prior year quarter.","Focusing on Individual Life Insurance, sales increased 12% sequentially as the strong momentum we discussed on our first quarter earnings call was sustained. MoneyGuard sales increased 15% over the prior year quarter, as we are benefiting from the expansion of our MoneyGuard II product, which we released in 2014.","Indexed Universal Life sales are growing as the marketplace adapts the new illustration requirements that take place beginning September 1st. Growth in these two products has been offset by decline in VUL and Term though we expect new product launches to help drive future sales in these products.","Our outlook for the Life Insurance business remains positive, drivers continued to indicate mid single-digit earnings growth as our diversified product portfolio combined with depth and breath of our distribution distinguishes Lincoln in the marketplace.","Turning to Group Protection, as I noted earlier, we are encouraged by the earnings improvement this quarter and reiterate that we expect to approach our target margin range of 5% to 7% by late 2016, early 2017.","Second quarter sales of $62 million were down 15% compared to the prior year quarter. Our pricing actions continue to put downward pressure on new business opportunities and we expect sales growth to remain soft as we move through the year.","We continue to make inroads on our targeted strategy to further expand the employee paid voluntary market. This is an important element in our overall strategy to achieve and sustain profitable growth in this business. In the quarter, 44% of sales were employee paid up slightly year-over-year.","So the bottomline in Group Protection is, we are encouraged by the earnings improvement we saw this quarter, management actions aims at restoring profitability are gaining traction and position as well to achieve our target margin range.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were impacted by higher expenses, in part related to investments for future growth, combined with lower spread income. The underlying business drivers remained firmly intact.","Second quarter deposits of $1.9 billion, were up 3% from a year ago and included growth in both recurring deposits and first year sales. Deposits increased 9% sequentially due to a pickup in first year sales activity. We believe this momentum is driven by investments we're making in our sales force and technology, and we expect to benefit further from these investments over time as we grow into our improved infrastructure.","Net flows remained a strong story in our retirement business. Net flows of $306 million in the quarter increased our year-to-date total to $422 million, compared to just $5 million in the prior quarter. Success has been driven by a number of factors, including stronger sales momentum in the mid-large market where we have had nearly three times as many wins compared to this time last year.","Our pipeline remained strong. And as a result, our outlook for positive net flows is intact and we now expect flows in the third quarter to exceed the second quarter, marking the third straight quarter of sequential growth. Fourth quarter is when we typically see large case movement, which reduces our ability to forecast net flows at this point. But we can provide more insight next quarter.","In distribution, we had another strong quarter. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to be a differentiator, enabling us to drive sequential increase in sales, I noted in my business segment commentary. Distribution also enables us to shift our business mix.","Notably, 69% of our total sales did not have long-term guarantees, up from 62% a year ago. We continue to invest in and grow our client facing professionals as total headcount now stands at over 1,400, up 3% versus the prior year.","These professionals help tell our compelling story to the 64,000 producers that sold Lincoln products over the past year and the 91,000 that have sold our products in the last 24 months. You\u2019ve heard we say many times that distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln and I expect this to continue, as our strong diverse distribution franchises are well-positioned to navigate future product and marketplace changes.","And briefly on investment management, we put new money to work in the second quarter at an average yield of 4.3%, which was up from 3.8% in the first quarter, as we benefited from rising market yields and asset mix. We continue to see value in less liquid asset classes where yields and underlying fundamentals remain attractive.","We are not reaching for yield in the low investment-grade assets, which represented 4.4% of purchases this quarter and is less than our total portfolios below investment grade assets at 5.2%. Alternative investment income improved to $28 million, compared to $8 million in the first quarter with positive contributions from both our private equity and hedge funds strategies.","Lastly, with respect to the Department of Labor fiduciary standards proposal, consistent with the DOL's goals, we want Americans to buy the right product at the right price with a complete understanding of the cost and benefits. The tug and pull is around how best to achieve these objectives.","We submitted comment letters last week with our recommendations as to the number of other industry participants and major trade associations. Importantly, the DOL seems to be showing a willingness to listen and make changes to the proposal. We recognized there are questions on the implications to our business. However, it is still early and hard to predict where this will end up.","I would say if there is short-term sales disruption, lowering sales for some reason, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to blunt much of the earnings per share impact. Over that period, we would be very active, pivoting to new products, expanding our reach in existing markets while accessing our broad and diverse set of producers to drive future sales growth. You\u2019ve seen us do this repeatedly and very effectively across all product lines in the past 36 months. And I'm confident we will once again respond to marketplace or regulatory changes effectively.","In closing, I'm very pleased our actions taken to restore profitability in Group Protection are getting momentum. Our investments in RPS position us well for future growth while in our life business, drivers continue to indicate mid-single digit earnings growth potential.","In Annuities, we once again grew our high quality income stream. Bottom line, as we continue to see sales grow with very attractive new business returns across our franchise, we are confident future earnings will follow.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $371 million, or a $1.46 per share for the second quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 4% year-over-year as this quarter was negatively impacted by $0.03 while last year\u2019s second quarter benefited $0.04.","This year's results were also negatively impacted $28 million from elevated mortality in individual life due to several large claims. As you know, we do not normalize for mortality as it will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, we felt the abnormally high claims severity should be noted.","This quarter, we produced positive results in several key performance metrics. The topline once again posted healthy mid-single-digit growth with operating revenue up 4%. Another quarter of positive net flows in all of our segments, combined with growth in equity markets resulted in average account values reaching $224 million, a record level. ","Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8% to $50.83, as below the line items have been insignificant, enabling our operating earnings to consistently compound book value in the high single-digit range.","Operating return on equity came in at 11.7%, up 50 basis points from the first quarter as Group Protection earnings improved. And finally, our balance sheet remains well-positioned to providing significant financial flexibility.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $255 million, a 12% increase over last year. Operating revenues increased 7% from the second quarter of 2014, as positive net flows continued and equity markets remain supportive. This combination resulted in a 6% increase in average account values that reached $126 billion at the end of the quarter.","Return metrics remained strong and consistent with recent periods. ROA increased 4 basis points versus the prior year while ROE came in at 25%, again a very strong result. And in fact, Annuity ROEs have consistently been exceeding 20% for several years now.","Strong results from our hedge program combined with minimal policyholder behavior impact, further demonstrates the very high quality of our annuity income stream. Importantly, we also remain disciplined in how we allocate capital to our Annuity business and this has not hampered our ability to maintain strong ROEs, something that Dennis mentioned earlier that we expect to continue.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $105 million were down due to elevated mortality. Importantly, our claim counts declined as expected from a seasonally high first quarter. Sequentially, claim counts decreased 11%, while the year-over-year increase was consistent with in-force growth. Therefore, our adverse mortality this quarter was primarily driven by several large claims that resulted in abnormally high claims severity.","As I noted upfront, this negatively impacted earnings by $28 million. Let me bring you inside Lincoln\u2019s private perspective on how we assess and analyze this quarter\u2019s mortality results, including our key takeaways. Let\u2019s start with account experience, which measures frequency.","This quarter was favorable 2% to our expectations, while amount experience which measures dollars of claims was unfavorable by 14%. Favorable account experience and unfavorable amount experience indicates claims severity as the underlying driver results. On a statistical basis, this quarter was a 99 percentile kind of event, equivalent to a one in one hundred event. It\u2019s a very uncommon.","Included in this quarter's elevated claims severity was unfavorable experience in the large phase segment, meeting policies above $5 million. Within this cohort was an unusual concentration of injury-related deaths, which occurred to policyholders in their 40s. It is also worth mentioning that the business we recaptured at year end was largely in line with our expectations and was not a driver of the quarter's adverse mortality.","We continue to expect to recapture transaction to be accretive to EPS. Quickly on life earnings drivers, average account values increased 5%, with in-force base amount of 3%, consistent with recent performance and our organic growth expectations.","Normalized spreads came in at 165 basis points, down 3 basis points from the prior year. Spread compression continues but it's definitely abating. So overall, adverse mortality results in the quarter, but our analysis points this being the quarter marked exclusively by volatility.","We continue to expect that when viewed over more extended period of time, mortality experience will be in line with our longer term expectations. And in fact, if you look at both count and amount experience, for more extended period of time, let\u2019s say 2010 to 2014, we see that was right on top of our expectations.","Our outlook for life insurance business remains positive marked by mid-single-digit driver growth, good returns on new business and prospects for spread compression to abate. In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $30 million. Account values benefited from positive net flows in the second quarter along with supportive equity markets and as a result, average account values increased sequentially and ended the quarter at $55 billion, up 5% versus the prior year.","Normalized spreads compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations for spreads that decline by 10 to 15 basis points annually in the retirement business. Earnings were negatively impacted a $2 billion from expense anomalies that are unlikely to persist but I would note that results will continue to include incremental investments in IT and our sales force. We expect these incremental investments to position us well for future growth, that when combined with rising interest rates should lead to earnings growth in RPS.","Group protection earnings of $19 million were well above the $2 million reported in the prior year quarter and operating losses the past two quarters. Loss ratios benefited from the pricing and claims management actions we have been implementing.","Non-medical loss ratio improved from 78.1% in the first quarter to 73.6% this quarter. This marks our lowest loss ratios since the third quarter of 2013. Sequential progress was driven by improvement in all product lines, life, visibility and dental.","Our disability loss ratio improved 7 percentage points over the prior year as LTD incidents and recoveries continue to improve. Caseloads per claim examiner which were elevated are likely to reach targeted levels in the third quarter, which should help reduce some of our recent earnings volatility.","Excluding $10 million of accelerated amortization back in the first quarter, this marks our second straight quarter of solid earnings improvement. So we are encouraged by this momentum which reflects management actions aimed at restoring profitability. Nevertheless, claims can be volatile quarter to quarter. Despite that I believe this quarter validates that we are in a path to an earnings recovery in Group Protection.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. Our business model continues to generate capital allowing us to support sales growth at very attractive returns, also allocating capital to shareholders. Capital return remains a key focus and to this point, buyback totaled $150 million in the second quarter, moving us to $500 million year-to-date.","Statutory surplus stands at $8.4 billion and we estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 505%, a very strong number. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $545 million as we returned $250 million of debt in June. Recall that, we prefunded that maturity with our March debt offering.","On prior conference calls, we have noted we remain comfortable with our leveraging capital structure. As you know, our capital structure includes hybrid which move the floating rate coupons in 2016 and \u201817. I would like to point out though that we have entered into swaps to lock in the fixed rate, a fixed rate on those securities and our current intent is to hold them.","So to conclude and looking forward, organic growth drivers are firmly intact. Margin improvement and Group Protection is emerging. Abnormally high claim severity and individual life is unlikely to repeat. Enterprise expense discipline creates an earnings lever. Spread compression is abating and at current rates, we expect to be at the low end of the 2% to 3% range we previously communicated and our outlook for capital management remains strong and is aligned with shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jimmy Bhullar with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi. The first question is just on, if you think about the DOL standards, the way the preliminary proposal was, how does -- how do you think it will affect your business whether it\u2019s in annuities or in life insurance or retirement?","Dennis Glass","Jimmy, it\u2019s very difficult to speculate about provisions that are -- sorry, in motion if you will, that are changing. I think the analyst observations on this sort of focus on possibly the VA business being affected by it. That would be related to whether or not and how you charge for advice inside of qualified plans whereas commission or fee for advice.","But on that particular plan, I\u2019ll repeat what I said a minute ago, if VA sales were to be affected and decline a little bit, we think that capital that would be otherwise employed for the sales and buy share back and plant the large majority of that impact giving us time to pivot as we have demonstrated in the past, we can pivot. So I\u2019m answering the question that I see in lot of analyst reports, first, not that I think that the outcome that is certain.","Jimmy Bhullar","So besides commission, could it affect your ability to sell VAs without guarantees in retirement plans?","Dennis Glass","Would it affect our ability to sell renewals in return\u2026","Jimmy Bhullar","Within qualified brands, if you think\u2026","Dennis Glass","If you have changed the structure of how you pay the advisors who are selling it, that\u2019s the biggest issue. Again, we\u2019re not all convinced that that\u2019s going to happen. It could.","Jimmy Bhullar","And any impacts that you see in any of the other businesses?","Dennis Glass","The other impacts are more opaque. It could be some issues in terms of extra cost in the retirement business which we would -- this is the problem with the Department of Labor\u2019s proposal. It unfortunately could and again they are willing to move it or they are willing to respond because everybody\u2019s goal is to keep cost low and value high for Americans.","And so I think we have to work with the DOL to remove some of the extra paper work that seems to be required so that cost aren\u2019t increased that might ultimately be transferred to the customer.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then there has been a lot of talk about M&A recently. How do you view Lincoln in the current environment maybe just because you have interest in potential acquisitions? You\u2019ve talked about interest in Group Insurance and retirement in the past. Are you still looking at doing deals in those businesses?","Dennis Glass","That\u2019s a great question. I have been thinking myself for the last couple of days across the financial services of the industry, I guess, maybe excluding bank. It\u2019s a bit of a rodeo out there. P&C, healthcare companies, and each of those industries that have sort of idiosyncratic reasons why it\u2019s occurring. If you look at the life insurance industry, we\u2019ve got two important transactions, of course, the protected transaction and now StanCorp which reflects new capital coming into the market place. New capital coming into the market place is a good thing.","As we know or as has been talked about and it appears the returns that these companies are being brought at are probably mid single digit. If I look at and hear what\u2019s going on elsewhere in our industry with some of the strategic deals that have been done over the past 24 months.","Once again the discount rate seemed to be 7% to 8%, even after taking into consideration or taking in considerations synergies and revenue enhancing opportunities. So 7% to 8% for buying businesses. When you come -- are able to put new business up at 12% to 14%, when you can buy your capital back at 12% to 14%, it just seems to be at the moment pretty huge impediment for Lincoln to be doing transactions.","Having said that, discount rates change, market environments change, sometimes some companies have a greater ability to affect the income of the target company so that you can get actually a lot of earnings and discount those earnings back at a decent discount rate and still win.","But in summary, when you find business is 8% and you can sell your new product at 12% to 14, I think at Lincoln, we choose to selling new product at 12% to 14%. And if we don\u2019t have -- and we\u2019re generating more capital as we have, then what\u2019s necessary to support new products who buyer our stock back because we still think we can get that kind of return on it. I am sorry. I have gone on a little bit.","Jimmy Bhullar","No, thank you. And just lastly, if you could -- how do you see Lincoln as a potential takeout candidate in this environment, are you -- do you have scale in all the businesses that you are in that you could do well on your own or are you looking for or do you think you will be better off as part of a larger company and\/or are you too large to be acquired because Japanese companies obviously the ones they bought were half of your size?","Dennis Glass","Yes, Jimmy, again over the time I have been in the business, all the things that you have mentioned has changed. What has not changed is our view that we will look to any opportunity to enhance shareholder value. And if that includes some of the things you talked about great. But the critical issue is what\u2019s our potential as a standalone company, we think that\u2019s great. If there is something else that might be better than that over the long term, obviously we will consider it. But our focus right now has to be, continues to be as it always has been building a great franchise that produces earnings growth and grows over time.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Steven Schwartz with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz","Hey, good morning, everybody. A couple. I don\u2019t know if Mark is there and this question has to do a little bit I think with the DOL and FINRA in this case. Does LFN sell VA\u2019s with [C-shares] [ph]? There seems to be a movement of FINRA trying to forbid this practice, which seems to be contracting the DOLs. So I am just wondering about LFN.","Dennis Glass","Steve, we\u2019re going to get back to you on that. At LFN, we sell products on a variety of commission-based fees. We don\u2019t have in front of us the statistics as to which one dominates. So if you don\u2019t mind, we will get back to you on that.","Steven Schwartz","No, not a problem. I realize I always a little bit out of the box. Two more though. Randy, was the takeaway -- I am just going a little fast, is the takeaway on the mortality that it was predominantly driven by accidental deaths people in their 40s?","Randy Freitag","Yes. As I noted, we had $28 million of after-tax impact in the quarter. Now if you turn that into dollars of claims, it was about $46 million of claims over and above what we expect. If you dig inside of that $46 million, what you see is that $32 million of it was located as I mentioned in my script in policies that were bigger than $5 million. So it definitely had a large claim bias. And inside of that $32 million, we saw was $20 million or so, $19 million, $20 million was located inside of the $40 million, a younger age bucket, a younger age cohort, people in their 40s, and they were predominantly accidental deaths in nature.","So when I think of accidental deaths, I think of things like homicides, accidental deaths, suicide that sort of stuff. So it was definitely driven by these large claims for the quarter as they made up nearly 70% of the total. And inside of that, there was a trend in younger age, which is just well outside of the norm, well outside of our expectations.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. All right. That\u2019s good and said. And then one more for you. You talked about a little bit retirement plan, but I think overall prepayments may cause another variable. Investment income was very low for the quarter at least relative to what\u2019s in the supplement. Is there a way to put a number on this by any chance, first do you agree? And then second, is there a way to put a number on this?","Dennis Glass","I guess I don\u2019t think. Are you asking, is the level unusual in those two categories?","Steven Schwartz","Well, in general for the company?","Dennis Glass","Well, let me respond specifically to what happened in the quarter. We had $28 million of alternative income, which is about where we\u2019ve been over the last two years, 2013 and 2014, averaged around 25. On prepayment, we\u2019re at 11, which was compares to about $30 million over the last two years. So it\u2019s little bit less than what we experienced.","Prepayment income is moving income from one period to another. So we don\u2019t focus on that a lot. We did do a lot of analysis as to whether or not there is potential for that number to increase or decrease. I think where interest rates are for our book specifically, prepayment income will probably play a part of our earnings for a couple more years.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. Thank you, Dennis.","Randy Freitag","Steven, I would point out in that regard that when you freeze down to the businesses year-over-year, prepayment income last year was really a benefit for the life insurance business in the second quarter. And if you remember on last year\u2019s call, life insurance business I noted that they had roughly $6 million after-tax of benefit from strong prepayment income. It\u2019s probably a little bit of benefit in the retirement business last year in the second quarter, but I specifically spiked up last year\u2019s $6 million for the life insurance, but didn\u2019t have this year.","Steven Schwartz","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","And our next question is from Suneet Kamath with UBS. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Just first on the mortality, Dennis you had referenced two sequential quarters with bad mortality. So as we sit here ahead of the third quarter deck review, how should we think about how these two quarters are going to inform whether or not you may needed to take some action on the life deck in the third quarter review?","Dennis Glass","I think you asked me, but I am going to turn that quickly over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","I will take that, Suneet. Obviously when we look at our assumptions, especially our long-term assumption like mortality, it\u2019s a lot more greater than the last two quarters. So while it may have some small impact over the 80s we would project going forward, it\u2019s relatively small. When you think about the longer-term context, the amount of mortality experience we have in the company, I would point on this mortality. I talked about this particular quarter, the count experience was 2% favorable and the amount experienced was 14% unfavorable.","If you look at those same statistics over a more extended period of time, just the right on top of our expectations. I talked about a 5 year period, 2010 to 2014, both those numbers exactly at a 100% of our expectation. Now year by year, you would see at 1% higher or 1% lower, 2% higher or 2% lower, but over that more extended period of time right on top of our expectations. So really see these two quarters as outliers. And I wouldn\u2019t expect them to have a significant impact on the third quarter unlocking.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And the while we are on the subject of the third quarter unlocking, any comments on where we sit today in terms of interest rates?","Randy Freitag","No, but broadly speaking on the third quarter unlocking. And when I think about unlocking, I really sort of break it down into three buckets. First, I think about elective policyholder behavior, and you are well aware that\u2019s been a very strong story at Lincoln, things like lapses we think over the last 4 or 5 or 6 year. It\u2019s just been a very strong story. It hasn\u2019t had much impact at all on the results.","And I would imagine I don\u2019t expect really much impact from the last year experience and you\u2019ve got an elective policyholder behavior, that\u2019s mortality. We just talked about mortality. And then you have the market-driven inputs, you have the J-curve, the long-term great assumption and then the long-term growth rate of the separate accounts. We will look at both those. We have another year of information, we have another year of low rates, and that will impact somewhat our analysis. But I am not going to front run the results, but we will definitely take a hard look at those market-driven inputs.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just for Dennis, I guess this one is for you. On the DOL proposal, I hear your comments about potential changes that may come to pass over the next couple of months. I have read some stories in the press about that as well. So I guess my question is when you talk about your expectations that things may change. Does that based on the conversations that you're actually having in DC? Or is it based on just kind of the general commentary in the media?","And the reason I asked the question is I've talked to our own contacts and some contacts in DC, I just get the sense that the view is that there probably won't be any major changes to the DOL. So I just want to get a sense of where your confidence is coming from if I'm characterizing it correctly.","Dennis Glass","Yes. Let me answer the question very specifically, Department of Labor Secretary, Perez, in the hearings said, he thought changes would have to be made to the proposal. So my comment is based upon his statement, public statement in the hearing. And whether or not he\u2019s drifted from that, I can\u2019t tell you. What I do know is you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a lot of rumor actually on both sides of the question.","So we just collectively have to continue to work for good outcome for Americans and a good outcome, mostly for Americans. Again, the tug and pull is not about the objective, the tug and pull is, are some of these proposals at odds with the intent of the Department of Labor when you dig into. I think all of the industry and trade association comments have been -- come on let\u2019s understand a little better practically what these things would do in the way they affect American consumers retirement products.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Bob Glasspiegel with Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning, Lincoln. Question on group protection, are you still sticking with sort of the timing of late '16, early '17 for where you\u2019re going to get to your targeted margins?","Dennis Glass","Yes. I said that in my comments.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay.","Dennis Glass","Yes.","Bob Glasspiegel","Okay. I just want to make sure because it looks like a good run rate to get there from Q2 to Q1 improvements. On the life side, you're saying I think the first quarter was a frequency blip and the second quarter was a severity blip, so no need to adjust underwriting and pricing actions?","Dennis Glass","No, Bob, not at all. As I noted in my script to once again highlight the points you made, the frequency was actually down 11% in the second quarter from the first quarter. And it was actually a little better than our expectations for the number of claims that we would have. So the second quarter was definitely a severity-driven event, which was very different. I mean, the first quarter if you remember, I believe is more related to a bad flu season, it was spread across the entire portfolio.","And so it was the number of claims spread across the entirety of the business that we issue whereas the second quarter was very focused in these larger claims as I mentioned. And some very abnormal items such as this focused on younger age, accidental claims that I talked about, so very different in the nature of the two quarters. And nothing that I would expect to cause any changes at all in our underwriting practices, which we believe are industry-leading and that have over time delivered great mortality results and mortality results that are exactly inline with our expectations.","Bob Glasspiegel","Nice to hear your confidence. Thank you.","Dennis Glass","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Devine with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Colin Devine","Thank you. Dennis, I was wondering if you could just draw into the potential impact from the DOL a little deeper. And I appreciate your comments about leveling compensation for your agents. But what about 12b-1 fees, what about marketing allowances? And if those had to go away, what would be the impact on Lincoln? And how might you be able to replace those?","Dennis Glass","Colin, again, I think, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s fairly specific. And I think, I\u2019d rather answer in general terms. And we've been conveying to the department labor, you have to look through the expenses to see what the benefit the customer is achieving.","And so, for example, the DOL seems to think that the fees charged for VA living benefit guarantees or VA\u2019s are the little bit expensive for the consumer in total. The response is the total fee isn\u2019t what matters it\u2019s what are the benefits.","But we keep coming back to -- we have well-designed products that provide very good consumer value and that ought to continue and we ought to be able to get those products into the marketplace, into the hands of consumers on a cost-effective basis.","So, there can be change in one or two of the line item of expenses but it takes a certain amount of fees and expenses to deliver good products. And I suspect that even the demand or living benefit products, there would be an industry way to accomplishment.","Colin Devine","All right. If I hear what you\u2019re saying then you\u2019re feeling confident that you could replace but the 25 basis points to [indiscernible] fees you\u2019re collecting now and what I assume is another 25 basis points or so of marketing allowances from the fund companies inside the VA?","Dennis Glass","I would say that's a level of detail that\u2019s hard to respond to specifically. And so I want to just take this up to level and say, there are certain costs and benefits that are necessary to get good product in the hands of the consumer. And I'm hopeful between the industries involved in this debate and DOL will arrive at a reasonable middle ground on that.","Colin Devine","Okay. Then one follow-up, Lincoln, has also been fairly active in de-risking. Its VA block. You move to bunch of assets under managed risk funds, you move to much element to index funds. What do you think your ability is going to be to do initiatives like that going forward with respect to the VA assets that are inside retirement accounts or inside IRA\u2019s, if this thing goes down pretty much at its laid out?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. As we\u2019ve discussed and if I can go to the Life side just for a second, I believe, if I recall correctly, we use to sell 65% of our business and guaranteed universal life, but today that\u2019s down to 12% or 18%. And any product in the Life Insurance portfolio is no more than 29% of our current sales. So we really made good progress in diversifying what we sell in the Life portfolio.","By move to the Individual Annuity portfolio and I know you know this or not, I\u2019m just repeating it for everybody's benefit. We\u2019ve gone from selling essentially 92% of the business on a guaranteed basis to where today we\u2019re almost at 70% on a guaranteed basis, just gross sales.","And so we moved the dial diversification of VA portfolio, 20% in the space of 36 months, both with the ability to tap into new markets, which are represented by the 91,000 different advisors that have brought our products over the last 24 months and by adding products like Investor Advantage.","So, I will tell you separate from the DOL issue. It\u2019s our intention to continue to diversify products and that would include responding what we sell into the variable annuity market. And we look at this very carefully. We see some opportunities and as we come forward with more ideas on that and our actionable ideas will convey that too, our investors and the people on this phone.","Randy Freitag","Let me add. We\u2019ve actually done very little of -- I think what you referenced. I think what you\u2019re referencing the things like VA buy-outs and that sort of stuff. And I think as \u2026","Colin Devine","I was talking about this [SunTrust] [ph] market, where you did a fairly significant move I believe last year into index funds, the SEC approved it obviously, as well as in the managed hedge funds of in-force assets.","Dennis Glass","The majority of what we have has just been sold. So, I think as you would expect out of a high quality book covered by a high-quality hedge program like ours. I really don't see the inability to do things like that would have any impact on this at all, because there is really not a need to do anything like that.","Colin Devine","Okay. Thank you.","Dennis Glass","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Michael Kovac with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Kovac","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A question on variable annuities. It look like sales were strongly rebounded in the quarter and the ROE looked stable. But the equity in this business was up about 20% versus the year ago. The account values were up maybe closer to single digits and given the mix shift that would expect to more or less capital intensive products that you might see sort of -- and inverse of that. Can you let us know what\u2019s going on there?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. We\u2019ve seen -- in the annuity business, we have some flows on our capital we allocate to the business that are linked to account value. We have floors because the VA guarantee businesses is a type of business, especially in out markets where your sarcastic models will really tell you that you can take capital out of the business and I think what you end up is a bad risk position. The most floors have really sort of kicked in over the last year, 18 months and pushed the capital.","Now despite that, I would point out, Michael that we have continued to report ROEs in the mid-20s. So the capital is definitely -- we are not driven by the very conservative approach we have to allocating capital, which is the greater of these account value linked floors and a sarcastic approach. We continue to report very strong returns.","Michael Kovac","Yeah. I appreciate that. And then thinking about group, in terms of the pricing that you think you still need to take to get to your margin goals, where are we on that basis and what are you seeing in the competitive environment in terms of the ability to push through that much pricing?","Dennis Glass","Yeah. I think, if you go back to the beginning of this, we talked about a $1 billion of business to reprice and I think we\u2019re roughly 55% of the way or so through that. By the end of this year, we will be three quarters to 80% ROE through that and the balance will come over the remainder of 2016. So, we\u2019re working our way through it. In terms of the other big earnings driver, it would be the things that we\u2019ve done on the claims management area. And as I mentioned, I think we are pretty much where we need to be on that, I\u2019d expect to be there in the third quarter.","Randy Freitag","Let me expand on your questions just a little bit. Just give you a couple of high-level statistics. We had year-to-date premium renewal about $512 million and we were able to move the net after-tax margin on that business up by 7% versus what it had been at. And somewhat -- because getting price increases needs to -- that's one piece of it. The other piece is how much you are retaining, what is the margin on what you're retaining and what the margin on what\u2019s leading? And so this 7% increase in margin sort of captures all of that and it\u2019s a pretty good indication about pricing actions that we\u2019re taking are getting traction.","Michael Kovac","Thanks. I appreciate the answers.","Dennis Glass","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. We do have time for one more question. Our next question will be from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jay Gelb","Thanks. Sorry, if it\u2019s already covered but the $159 buyback faced in 2Q, should we view that as a reasonable run rate for the rest of the year?","Randy Freitag","Jay, as you\u2019ve read, we don\u2019t get into the specific around this. I\u2019ll go back to the words I said at the beginning of the year really, which is we\u2019d expect to exceed last year\u2019s buyback total of $650 million. We\u2019re at $500 million in the first two quarters of the year. I point out that cash of the holding company remains strong $545 million, above the 500 million that we target.","We continue to generate strong earnings in the balance sheet at the life company is very strong 505% RBC ratio. The other thing I point out is that I would expect over the last half of the year to likely to do obviously financing transaction that would also free up a little bit of capital. So I think, everything is in place and very supportive of continuing to do a buybacks at healthy pace.","Jay Gelb","That\u2019s great, Randy. And then Dennis, in your prepared remarks, I believe you mentioned mid-single digit earnings growth potential. Was that for the whole company and if it was, did that pull back a bit from mid to high single digits previously in terms of an outlook?","Dennis Glass","Though let\u2019s be very specific about the answer to this question. In terms of my specific remarks, that if you remove notable items and look at EPS growth first quarter 2000 -- excuse me -- second quarter 2014 versus second quarter 2015 and that was middle single digits.","I would direct you for a longer term deal back to what I thought was a pretty good chart of potential earnings growth over the next couple of years and specific drivers of that growth which I think added up to, Randy?","Randy Freitag","8% to 10%.","Dennis Glass","8% to 10%. So in my comment specifically quarter-over-quarter after notable adjustments and there's no reason for us to think that that chart -- statistics in that chart are any different today than they were when we put it there.","Jay Gelb","Okay. Great. So 8% to 10% long-term EPS growth potential. And then finally, just a quick one for Randy on the individual life segment, the operating income $105 million but based on your commentary about the elevated mortality, am I thinking right that several run rate in that business is closer to 125 or might be higher?","Randy Freitag","No. I think if you just mathematically take 105 and add 28 million of mortality that I know that would be in the mid 130s, which is more in line with my expectations. You can get there a number of different ways. If you go back to the last year second quarter when we made $148 million and back off the prepayment income was $6 million that I mentioned you mentioned back off, there was a $5 million normalizing item.","It would be sort of in that mid 130 area again. You can go back longer term in that. If you go back a few years and you look at what the business made and you grow and you back off the spread compression and the capital actions that you\u2019ve talked about, once again hit in that mid 130 range. So when I think about the business I continue to think about right in that range, the mid 130s and what earnings drivers that are growing at 4% to 5%.","Jay Gelb","Very helpful. Thank you.","Dennis Glass","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And that does end our Q&A session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Christopher Giovanni.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you again, Bridget. Thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, we will be around to take questions at the Investor Relations line at (800) 237-2920 via email at investorrelations@lfg.com. Thank you all again and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Please go ahead.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources, are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.","These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com where you can find our press release and statistical supplement which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measure.","Before beginning, I would like to also remind you that we will be hosting our Investor Day on November 16 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. I trust you received our invitation, and we hope most of you will be able to attend.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. 2017 continues to be an outstanding year, as third quarter operating earnings and earnings per share were a record. Operating EPS increased 7% compared to the prior year and marked the first time quarterly EPS has exceeded $2.00 per share. Book value per share increased 8% and ROE was 13.6%.","As you know, during the quarter we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review which had a small impact on our financials. Randy will provide you more detail in his remarks.","This quarter's strong earnings was broad-based, as all four businesses posted high quality results. Group Protection and Life Insurance had strong underwriting results while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. Variable investment income, which has been higher than expected in recent quarters, returned to more historical levels, further highlighting the underlying strength of earnings. These excellent results are supported by solid execution of strategies we implemented a few years back to further diversify our sales mix and source of earnings. This diversification provides stability during periods of capital market uncertainty while still enabling us to capitalize on significant long-term growth opportunities and capital market tailwinds.","One can measure the success we're having with these strategies as the contribution from mortality and morbidity sources of earnings has increased a couple of percentage points year-to-date.","The impact of low interest rates on spread-based business continues to abate and earnings related to fees on AUM are benefiting from the strength in equity markets.","The complementary nature of our businesses and source of earnings also enable us to consistently generate a significant amount of free cash flow supporting active capital management, which includes $264 million returned to shareholders in the quarter.","Additionally, last night we announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend. We will continue to look for opportunities that leverage the strength of the balance sheet and our steady capital generation.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. Results were strong, as earnings are benefiting from our high quality and predictable in-force business combined with equity market tailwinds.","Let me remind you, for years we have demonstrated our Annuity book of business is one of the best in the industry, highlighted by returns in excess of 20% and extremely favorable risk metrics.","Shifting to sales, we remain encouraged about our ability to grow. Variable annuity sales increased modestly compared to the prior year, and marks the first year-over-year growth in over three years.","Compared to the second quarter, sales decreased slightly, consistent with historical seasonality. However, sales picked up post-summer and continued to be quite strong in October.","Product expansion is a key focus for the Annuity business, and we now have the broadest portfolio of customer solutions we have ever had. This has resulted in market share gains over the course of the year, as we are benefiting from products that provide more investment choice and flexibility along with fee-based compensation options.","To these points, Max 6 Select, a living benefit rider we introduced late in the second quarter, has added nearly $50 million to sales and is continuing to gain traction, while fee-based sales totaled $79 million in the quarter, nearly matching all of 2016.","VA sales without living benefits increased 23% year over year, as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers.","Fixed Annuity sales increased 2% sequentially through improved competitive positioning and distribution reach, due in part to the reinsurance arrangement with Athene. These benefits more than offset the effect of low interest rates throughout most of the quarter.","So, a strong quarter for the Annuity business and I am encouraged by year-over-year growth in VA sales and solid momentum in the past couple of months. We clearly have more work to do to get back to positive net flows, but we remain confident in our ability to further build sales in the near term.","Longer-term, the value proposition of guaranteed lifetime income remains extremely important, and investable retirement assets are projected to grow considerably, creating significant opportunities for the Annuity marketplace.","In Retirement Plan Services, the strategy and franchise continues to drive top and bottom line growth. Total deposits in the quarter of $1.9 billion were up 6% from a year ago, driven by first-year sales increasing 11% to $672 million, as both small and mid to large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits increased 4%. Net flows totaled $415 million compared to $97 million in the prior-year quarter.","Over the past 12 months flows have exceeded $1.3 billion, a record for the Retirement business. Positive net flows for seven straight quarters are being driven by momentum in all three components of flows. First, sales are benefiting from the combination of a more productive wholesaling force and improved competitiveness in the marketplace, a result of product enhancement and digital innovations. Next, employee contributions have shown steady growth as our high-touch, high-tech model is providing an improved customer experience that is resulting in more employees participating and higher contribution rates. Lastly, retention remains strong as our expanded client-facing teams continue to drive better participant outcomes. Bottom line, I am as optimistic as I had ever been about the RPS business because of strong execution and competitive positioning in the marketplace with product and distribution.","Turning to Life Insurance, earnings decreased from the impact of our annual assumption review and lower variable investment income, while driver growth remained strong. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter of $178 million were down 8% as the prior year benefited from strong sales ahead of pricing adjustments on the interest rate-sensitive products. To this point, GUL sales were down 63% in the quarter. Excluding GUL, total Life sales were largely unchanged. With the pricing changes, returns on new business actually exceeded our 12% to 15% targeted returns. For the full year, sales have increased 10% with the same strong returns, as we are benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution.","MoneyGuard sales were solid, up 16% this quarter and returned to levels more consistent with prior periods after sales accelerated in the second quarter ahead of pricing adjustments. On term insurance, sales were near last year's record quarter and policy count increased 7% as we leveraged digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic. We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on capital. With new business returns above the top end of our targeted range, a well-diversified product portfolio and a more favorable macro backdrop, we see opportunities to improve our competitive position while maintaining targeted returns. Bottom line, the Life business is well positioned in the marketplace.","Turning to Group Protection, earnings increased significantly over the prior year, driven by favorable loss ratios. Premiums grew 3% in the quarter as sales and persistency continued to improve. During the quarter, sales increased 21% as all product lines and both employer and employee paid sales grew. Year-to-date, sales had increased 15% and we have good momentum entering the fourth quarter, which is historically our largest production quarter, as the pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets. We are also encouraged by persistency trends which are up four percentage points compared to prior year, driven by renewal trends in core life and disability products. As you know, we established a target of achieving 5% to 7% margins in 2018. Given results year-to-date, we now expect we will reach the target this year. While volatility is expected quarter to quarter, the focus is now on sustaining and improving margins over time. The strong, positive momentum in Group results over the last several quarters validates our continuing strategic investment in this business, which offers very good growth and earning diversification opportunities for Lincoln.","Shifting to investment results, the alternate investment portfolio achieved an 11% pre-tax annualized return, with solid results from both the private equity and hedge fund portfolios.","During the quarter we invested new money at an average yield of 4% compared to 4.1% in the second quarter. The decline is primarily driven by tighter spreads and increased purchases of shorter duration investments which match our liabilities and reflects Lincoln's tilt away from products with long-term guarantees.","The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.73%, consistent with expectations. Overall the investment portfolio remains in extremely good shape, high-quality and broadly diversified. Below investment grade assets represent only 4% of the fixed income portfolio, down one percentage point from the prior-year quarter largely due to maturities.","So in closing, I'm very pleased with results year-to-date including this quarter's record earnings. As I look forward I remain confident that our strategic objectives and initiatives will drive long-term sustainable growth.","As you know, and Chris mentioned, on November 16 we'll be holding our Investor Day and we look forward to providing you even more insight into our business and the key drivers that will enable us to sustain our strong track record of financial success and stability.","With that, let me turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported income from operations of $454 million, or $2.03 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 6% year-over-year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.09 from tax adjustments. This year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.","Separate from the annual review, the Group Protection business benefited $0.01 from a reinsurance recapture. A few comments on the outcome of this year's review. Annuity earnings benefited $15 million, primarily from favorable policyholder behavior assumptions. Earnings in the Life Insurance business were negatively affected by $16 million with no one item standing out.","It's also worth noting that we did not change our long-term rate assumption or unlock the reversion to the mean quarter, which still provides a cushion against declines in the equity markets. So the bottom line with the annual DAC and reserve review is that when viewed in total the assumptions underlying our balance sheet continue to be sound.","One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics. As Dennis noted, variable investment income returned to more normal levels, coming in $4 million or $0.02 per share, ahead of our expectations. This compares to $18 million or $0.08 per share last year.","Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, book value per share excluding AOCI grew 8% to over $61, an all-time high. Normalized ROE was strong at 13% and the year-to-date ROE of 12.6% is 60 basis points above 2016. Consolidated net flows were positive and end of period account values reached a record $246 billion. Balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $264 million to shareholders in the quarter.","Lastly, net income of $418 million further highlights the strength of the quarter, as NPR, which is noneconomic, had the largest below the line impact. Year-to-date net income represents 96% of operating earnings.","Now we will turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $277 million, up 5% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods.","Net favorable items this quarter included the $15 million I noted up front. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values, as equity markets' strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows.","The quality of our variable annuity book can be seen by looking at return metrics and net amount at risk. Normalized returns remain strong as ROE came in at 21%, while ROA was 79 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters. Net amount at risk improved to less than 6\/10 of 1% of account value for both living and death benefits.","So, minimal financial impacts from assumption changes, a superior risk profile of net amount at risk, well below competitors, and strong and consistent returns continue to differentiate us in the marketplace and highlight our prudent and disciplined approach to the Annuity business.","In Retirement Plan Services we reported earnings of $35 million, compared to $32 million in the prior-year quarter. Both periods included modest impacts from our annual assumption review. Excluding these items, earnings increased 6%, primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management.","Positive net flows of $1.3 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, drove average account values to $64 billion, a 13% increase.","Revenues increased 3%, while G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were flat year-over-year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income compressed 13 basis points year-to-date, compared to last year, consistent with expectations.","For the quarter ROA was 23 basis points excluding notable items, in line with recent quarters. The Retirement business continues to deliver solid growth in deposits, net flows, and assets, and combined with good expense discipline, RPS is well-positioned for future earnings growth.","Turning to the Life Insurance segment, earnings of $121 million included net unfavorable items of $16 million related to our annual review.","Excluding notable items, earnings decreased 9% as the prior-year quarter benefited from strong variable investment income. Mortality experience was favorable consistent with typical third-quarter seasonality.","Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with Life Insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income compressed 8 basis points year-to-date compared to last year, in line with expectations. So, a solid quarter for the Life business as mortality was right in line with expectations and the financial impacts from the annual assumption review were modest. Strong sales results year-to-date and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.","Group Protection reported $41 million in earnings compared to $28 million in the prior-year quarter. A significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. A $3 million benefit from the recapture of previously reinsured business was included in the quarter's results. The prior-year quarter included net favorable items of $5 million primarily from a disability reserve refinement.","The strong risk results experienced in the second quarter carried into the third quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio was 63.7% in the quarter, a 650 basis point improvement from the prior year excluding the disability reserve refinement.","Favorable disability and group life incidence rates, combined with lower new claim severity, remain the primary drivers of favorable loss ratios.","While we wouldn't expect loss ratios to consistently be this strong, results clearly reflect underwriting discipline coupled with positive external economic factors.","Premium growth is also aiding the Group business as premiums increased 3% from the prior-year quarter with leading indicators such as sales and persistency trending in a positive direction.","Bottom line, it was another very strong quarter for Group with year-to-date margins now exceeding the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range. While volatility is expected quarter-to-quarter we now expect margins to be consistently within our target range on a year-to-year basis, with gradual improvement over time.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. First on capital, both capital and capital generation remained strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. As I noted up front, this quarter we returned $264 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by the announcement of a 14% increase in our shareholder dividend which is consistent with our strong earnings growth.","As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend. Statutory surplus stands at over $9 billion and I estimate the RBC ratio end of the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash remains above our $500 million target.","So to conclude, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating earnings in EPS, underwriting results in Group Protection and Life Insurance were strong, while Annuity and Retirement Plan Services benefited from record account values. This year's annual review will once again confirm the quality of the assumptions underlying our balance sheet as there was almost no impact on our operating earnings. We grew book value per share by 8%, as below the line impacts were modest and normalized ROE was 13% which supports another year of ROE expansion.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up and then requeue if you have additional questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Crystal to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to start with Group and, Randy, I heard your update on the guidance there but certainly Lincoln and the industry have seen some favorable underwriting trends and do you think that based on \u2013 if the trends we're seeing in the economy and the rate increases you've put into your book the last few years, the benefits ratio is going to remain near the level that it's been the past two quarters?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Erik, thanks for the question. As I mentioned in my notes, clearly we believe we have achieved the goal that we set forth and expected to achieve next year, which is we expect to be on a quarterly basis between that 5% to 7% margin. What's driven that growth up to those targets has been driven primarily by the price increases, claims management improvements that we've made over the year. But clearly, additionally the economy we believe is having some impact.","Items like consumer confidence, which I believe is at a 17-year high. Items like low unemployment rate which is at 4.2% is clearly as low as it's been in some time. Those items are clearly having some favorable impact. As you can see during the quarter we ended up a little above our target range. So while we wouldn't expect to travel above our target range forever I think those items could be in place for a little bit but who knows. I think it's a solid quarter. We would expect all the items that drove this quarter to be in place as we move forward and we'll see where we come out, Erik. But thanks for the question.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Yeah. Thanks. And then just on Retirement, you're seeing obviously nice growth in flows and assets and I think Dennis had some very positive comments on the business momentum. Can you just comment where you see this business going over the next couple of years? And are we at a point where you sort of start seeing more positive operating leverage and margin expansion so that earnings sort of break out of the mid-$30 million range where they've been in recent quarters?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","As I said in my remarks, the business is in as good of a shape and our expectations of continued improvement is very strong. So how that translates directly into earnings we'll see over time, but all the changes to management, the product improvements, the processes that we have are driving these outcomes. So, they're real consumer value and substantive and something that will continue. So, yeah, we're pretty optimistic.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I thought overall, your results were obviously pretty strong. The one area that surprised though was indexed annuity sales which were weak, especially given the reinsurance contract with Athene. So could you give us just some color on what drove that? Did you see disruption because of the DOL rule or are there any other factors? And what your expectations are for that business?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","The indexed annuity sales will go up and down in any particular period. So I don't think there's anything different about the month or different about our competitive position. And again, as we moved into the late summer and October in particular, was a very strong quarter for all individual Annuity sales, very strong month, excuse me, for all individual Annuity sales. We continue to see positive momentum and are pretty confident that because of all the things that we've talked about, we will regain sales momentum across product lines.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then, Randy, could you give us the numbers, or the assumptions, the interest rate and separate account return assumptions that are embedded in your reserves and DAC balances?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Sure, Jimmy. If you look at the J curve our interest rate assumption as we've called it. As you know, over the past six years we've lowered that assumption three different times, 50 basis points each time. As we sit here today what underlies our assumption is a 10-year Treasury rate of about 375 basis points, a little below 375 basis points, but right about 375 basis points. So that underlies the ultimate earned rate, new money rate that we're moving towards. In terms of a separate account, I believe we are at about 7.3% these days from a separate account return standpoint.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the 3.75%, 10 year? By When are you assuming you will get there?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Five years.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Within \u2013 the flat sort of trend towards that rate?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes. Linearly over five years.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then obviously the separate account? A big component of that is the fixed income, so we should assume that the equity assumption embedded in the 7.3% is closer to 9%-ish, right?","A \u2013 [00CZ6W-E Randy Freitag]>: Yeah. I'm not going to get into the details. You can remember, I guess it was, two years ago we brought our separate account return assumption down, and that was driven by a reduction in our view of what the equity markets were going to do in future years.","As I also mentioned, Jimmy, we have outperformed this assumption and that leaves us in a positive position from a quarter standpoint. Currently that cushion in our quarters stand a little over $200 million in the Annuity business.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","A \u2013 [00CZ6W-E Randy Freitag]>: You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I want to follow up on Jimmy's question about annuities and as your comment about October being particularly strong, could you just provide a little bit more color in terms of what products are really driving that?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Suneet, it really is across the board in all products both fixed and variable annuities, and it reflects what I said in my remarks, particularly on the VA side, all the changes that we've been talking about the last six months, broadening the consumer value proposition, reaching into product areas that previously we had not offered. So it's an overall increase in all of the product lines. And just to put a number October was actually the highest aggregate sales month we've seen since 2015.","Now let me hasten to say that one month does not create a new level. But it's the best month that we've had. And again I'm going to come back, broadly based across all of our products, and due to good distribution and effective wholesaling, all the things that separate us in the marketplace.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then is it fair to say that maybe some of the uncertainty or pressure from DOL is now starting to abate? Or is that going too far?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","At one point, the qualified sales were, the growth in those were drifting away from the nonqualified sales. That seems to have now be more in lock step so that would be an indication that some of the DOL effects are less important. I think it was reported this morning that the DOL has applied with the OMB for this extension of the second implementation of rules, not occur until 2019. So that would help as well and give us more opportunity in the industry to shape this final DOL ruling, shape it in the context of both what's good for American savers, in particular.","And of course we'll continue to emphasize as we move forward in our discussions with the DOL, both choice of compensation for the consumer, and what's in the best interest from a compensation perspective. And oftentimes the answer to the best interest is actually commissions.","So a lot to see happen over the next 18 months but to answer your question specifically, I think this pause plus the distance from June 2019 (35:32) is beginning to ease the impact of the DOL from a sales standpoint.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then you didn't mention in your comments but are you still expecting positive flows in annuities by 2018?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think that's going to be a little harder to get to because some of this is just fact-based, with the increase in account balances the amount of outflow is a little higher than we expected when we were talking about that number. So a little tougher to get there certainly in the early part of 2018, but everything we're talking about, both in terms of our product and our distribution as well as demand for particularly guaranteed lifetime income, is going to drive us to a positive net flow period over time.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. We've heard from some other insurers about the cost of life reinsurance rising. To what degree are you all seeing that? And did that influence your actuarial review at all on the Life Insurance side? And also \u2013 and just relatedly, is that an issue we should be thinking about being a negative for future margins?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, Tom. Discussions with reinsurers have been going on for four to five years now. In the case of Lincoln, outcomes of those discussions have ranged from a bigger capture like we did at the end of 2014 for a payment, to sometimes modest increases in rates we're paying for reinsurance.","All those discussions that we've had over the past four to five years are embedded in our balance sheets, in our income statements and our expectations for any future discussions that we may have are also embedded in our assumptions. So they're in our balance sheet and our income statement so I feel really good about where we are from an assumption standpoint. That doesn't mean that actual outcomes couldn't differ from assumptions, but I think we've managed through this situation over the past years and I expect us to continue to do that as we move forward.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks, Randy. So nothing, like, new when you think about repricing of current contracts or coverage you have in place, there's nothing new that's like meaningful where you would see that as a new development?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No, I don't think there's any new developments. This has been going on, like I said, for four to five years and I think it will continue into the future for a little bit.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got you. And then a question on the reinsurance contract with Athene. If we do get corporate tax reform and corporate tax rate lowered to 20%, does that deal still make sense for you? Do you get enough of a benefit where it's a positive IRR versus your cost of capital?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Tom, let me talk about tax reform in general for the moment and remind all of us, I guess, the blindly obvious which is that we're in the early stages of tax reform. And it is going to change as it moves forward through the legislative process. So with this in mind, I'll just make a couple of industry comments.","The first one is that the industry already pays a little bit more than it earns as a percentage of corporate profits. So roughly speaking, the Life Insurance industry share of all U.S. corporate profits is like 1.8%, yet our share of corporate income tax is more in the neighborhood of 2.2% to 2.3%. So going into all of this legislative process, we're pretty well positioned in not being an undertaxed industry.","I'll also say that the industry view is that if there is any reduction in expenses or tax items that sort of go along with rate reductions, our industry view for our industry is they should be spread across the major areas rather than a single item so no business model is disproportionately helped or hurt. And so there's so much change that's going on or, excuse me, so much potential for different outcomes that I think we should just wait until we have a little more confidence before commenting on any specific issue related to tax.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Tom's question on reinsurance costs, I hear you on the impact to the balance sheet. Would that extend to the intangible piece of the balance sheet? So like would goodwill related to Life Insurance be impacted at all?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Alex, when you hear me say things like balance sheet I didn't qualify that in any way. I mean the entirety of our balance sheet. So embedded in actual results over the past four years have been the impact of anything we've done with reinsurers and we have assumptions for what may happen to reinsurance rates embedded in our assumptions going forward and that impacts the entirety of our balance sheet and our income statement.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks. And I guess a couple of your peers have made tweaks to the CTE-95 levels that they're sort of managing to, so I was just interested if you guys made any adjustments and just an update on sort of where you stand relative to your CTE target level?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Alex, yeah. Thanks for the question. So we cap, we price for and capitalize our Annuity business, our available Annuity business, using what I call a greater of approach. It's the greater of CTE-98 and a percent of account value. We use CTE-98 because I think that you really need to move deep into the tails to understand the risk profile on this business. So I don't necessarily believe that CTE-95 is deep enough into the tail for the true profile of this business to emerge, and we use the greater of approach bringing in the percentage of account values because this business is one of those ones that can be countercyclical.","It would be account values and as the risk comes out of the business you keep sucking capital out of it right before the capital markets decide to move against you and then you need to shove capital back into it. So I think that greater of approach along with the deep in the tail CTE-98 measure is what is prudent approach to running this business and it's what we do. It hasn't changed at all, Alex.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. So, no changes there. And so should I interpret that as you feel pretty good about where you're at relative to what the NAIC is doing and sort of some of the stuff that's come out of the quantitative impact study?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. Look, I feel great about our Annuity business. I feel great about the products we've issued. I feel great about the risk profile. I feel great about how we capitalize it. Separate from that, there's a lot of work going on with the NAIC and Oliver Wyman around potentially changing how we reserve for these products going forward. I think that work is moving along nicely. We're active participants. I think that in general, as I've said before, the approach the NAIC is taking which is to make statutory reserves more economic in nature is a good thing. It reflects how we reserve for these products and capitalize these products on a GAAP basis. So I think that's a good thing.","That doesn't mean there aren't some bad parts about where they end up, and in total it's a good thing for the industry, it's a good thing for Lincoln, we're participating and we're very happy with the way it's moving along.","Alex Scott - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Good morning, Lincoln, and congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question, pushing Tom's question in a different area, the Republican proposal is coming out, I guess, in the next hour and I guess it's going to double your estate tax and eliminate it in five years. How sensitive would Life sales be to a doubling of the estate tax? Last time around what did it do to production?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Bob, a couple of comments on that. I haven't seen this. When you say double the estate tax, I'm not sure what that means but to answer your question...","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","It's set at 5.6% and 11.2%, double immediately to 11.2% and 22.4%?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, that's not \u2013 I'll have to understand that because the effective tax rate after the $10 million individual exclusion is up in the 40%s so I'm not familiar with that. I'll look at it. But let me answer the question to the extent that I think about estate tax and Lincoln. Only about 10% to 12% of our sales are estate tax driven at this point, and so any changes in the estate tax that require more planning or less planning is not on the negative side going to hurt us too much and if it requires more planning, that would help.","And I'd also point out from Life sales, the most important issue, I think \u2013 not making it most important, but an important issue is this $10 million individual joint exclusion really eliminates estate taxes on a large amount of the American families. However, that $10 million was to go away then you'd have taxes on the step-up in basis and that could actually provide an opportunity for Life sales. So a lot of moving parts, a lot of different outcomes, so let's just see where it goes. But again I'll come back to, at this moment in time we don't have significant sales related to estate tax planning. About 10%.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","That's helpful, Dennis. The journal article does say that the step-up in basis did remain at the last minute. That was a surprise. But obviously whatever they propose isn't going to be what happens.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, we all know that so let's all keep watching it and of course Lincoln will be participating through the NA- excuse me, the ACLI and trying to shape good tax policy for America and good tax policy for the life insurance industry as we move through this process.","Robert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just first, Randy, could you just remind us of the typical seasonal pattern of mortality that you'd expect in the Life Insurance business, I guess particularly just thinking about the fourth quarter and how that usually compares to your kind of baseline assumption?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Ryan, the first quarter of the year is typically seasonally high. I would say somewhere between 8% and 10% above the average quarter and then you get that back over the last two quarters of the year pretty much evenly, so somewhere between 94%, 95% of an average quarter in the third and fourth quarter of the year. That's what we historically have seen and that's pretty specific to each company. It's based upon your mix of business.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then we've seen a number of your peers take modeling-related charges in their SGUL blocks as they move to an individual policy modeling system. You obviously haven't seen that. Can you just give us an update on kind of how your approach has been at this point for modeling purposes?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Well, Ryan, I think we have a highly sophisticated approach to both valuing all of our business, including SGUL policies both from a reserve standpoint and a DAC standpoint. So I don't know what to tell you beyond that. We've had good experience on SGUL in terms of the assumptions playing out like we thought they would. Outside of the interest rates, obviously and we've talked about that, but in terms of policyholder behavior and things like lapse rates, how people pay premiums, I think we've had really good experience. Any changes we've reflected in the model. So we have a very sophisticated valuation system that projects these policies on a policy basis and we feel good about where we are.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. That's what I thought. Thanks.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. Looking at Group Protection, I was just wondering is there any pricing differences between how you kind of set your pricing for employee paid versus employer paid? In other words, do you target a different loss ratio between the two categories?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think in general we see better margins not coming from any one particular part of pricing on the employee paid than we do on the employer paid side. And I think you have to peel back the onion on that because certain products such as critical illness or accident which is included in employee paid, require different margins than sort of core Life Business does. So yes, there are differences driven by the product mix.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Yeah. I guess what I was trying to get to is obviously the loss ratios have increased good, favorable in the last couple of quarters. And obviously there's some favorable underwriting happening, but I was just trying to see how much of an impact is coming from the mix shift?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. I don't think there's any difference in our expectations relative to the aggregate numbers inside your question.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the Annuity sales, you talked about some of the recent refinements of how launches (51:38) are seeing good momentum. But I think at the same time there's also greater competition from your competitors launching similar fee-based products, enhancing their product suites. Can you talk about in general how the competitive environment in terms of VA products are offering a return, any potential risks of getting back into an arms race again?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","My answer on that is, no. I don't see us \u2013 the industry getting back into an arms race. That doesn't mean that any particular competitor might not be emphasizing a product for a particular reason, and intentionally make it more competitive than maybe the industry. But I just think it's a reasonably logical market from a pricing standpoint right now. And most of our share increase as I mentioned in the opening remarks, is not just better results for our historical products, but the addition of new products that have more investment flexibility. So we have an opportunity to improve sales across a broader portfolio than we have had ever in the past. And so that's how we're trying to increase sales as opposed to increasing sales on the basis of price.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open. And it looks like they have disconnected. Our next question will come from Randy Binner from FBR.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question, and this kind of gets to like the spread guidance in Annuities and Retirement and just looking at our model, the interest credited has been managed very effectively in both of those areas. And so I guess my question is, is there \u2013 how much more can you push that? And is there kind of a stopping point where you kind of run out of room to kind of push the liability cost in both of those segments?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thanks, Randy. I think your question was specific to Annuities and Retirement and the answer is different for those. In the Annuity business we feel very comfortable in our ability to manage credit rates consistent with changes in earned rates. A significant percentage of our policies still have room between the current creditor rate and the guarantee so we feel very comfortable and you've seen that over the last few quarters.","On the Retirement business, and this has been the case for some time now, our rates are pretty close to the guarantees and so as the credited rate movements down you've seen a bit more of a function of that fact that the new business we've been bringing on comes on at a lower rate as opposed to us managing in-force creditor rates. And that's why in that business we expect over a near-term annual spread compression in the 10 basis points to 15 basis points range. As I mentioned year-to-date we're down 13 basis points in the Retirement business. So the answer is different for those two businesses.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","So 10% to 15% would be the expectation for 2018 and 2019, all things being equal in Retirement?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","I mean, we typically don't talk out a few years but yes, that's what we've been saying is 10 basis points to 15 basis points is our current expectation and that's what we've been experiencing recently.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. That's all I had. Thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Can I just jump in on that? And when we get to the IRB, we're going to have some very by business line demonstration of where there's earning headwinds and where there's earning growth opportunities. And so just to front run that a little bit, in the RPS, there's a little more headwinds from spread compression but much of that will be offset by expense management. So I really encourage people to come to the IRB or check in somehow because we're going to have a lot of good information around strategy and earnings around each business and what the important opportunities are or challenges are.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah. Well, okay. So then I guess I'd say what drives those expense initiatives? Is that the money you're spending for the strategic digitalization initiative? Or are there other kinds of changes you can make to the expense structure?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","In RPS it's a combination of digitization and lowering expenses that way but we also have a very major, sort of aside from that initiative, a very major reengineering process going on. So it's a combination of those two things that will drive our expenses down over time. And again we'll get into that in the IRB, those kind of details for each of the business lines.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chris Giovanni for any closing remarks.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Great. Thanks so much, Crystal, and thank you all for joining us.

At our recent investor conference, we reiterated our strategy to capitalize on Lincoln's key strengths in the current economic environment and earnings mix driven by growing equity markets, rising interest rates and mortality and morbidity coupled with an unusually strong distribution franchise that allows us to pivot nimbly between products that maximize returns from among this earnings mix as market forces change and consumer demographics that increase the demand for what we sell. This quarter underscores those strengths and demonstrates our execution on that strategy, and the numbers speak for themselves.","From the conference, you may recall that a little more than a 1\/3 of our earnings are driven by equity charges. The combination of strong net flows and rising equity markets consequently drove equity-based revenues up 20%, which contributed to company-wide revenue growth of 6%. You'll also recall that another roughly 1\/3 of our earnings are driven by investment spreads and that those spreads have been declining as interest rates fell.","Rates have firmed up a bit, allowing us to invest new money at about 190 basis points over the 10-year treasury today, for a gross investment yield of around $450 million. This gross yield was about 85 basis points less than our portfolio yield. The good news is that the rate of investment spread compression will abate at today's market yields, and the possibility of a turning point to improving investment spread may be coming sooner than we expected. Remaining earnings are derived mostly from mortality and morbidity, and we saw much better mortality and morbidity results in our group Life businesses as compared to the first quarter.","We highlighted at the conference the strength of our distribution franchise and our ability to pivot to both good customer solutions and more profitable products that improve ROE. This trend continued in the second quarter, with outstanding sales results in every business accompanied by stronger new business returns. Following the collective pricing actions we have made, most of our products are expected to achieve unlevered returns in the 13% -- 11% to 13% range, with leverage 13% to 15%. A positive exception is our VA business, which is producing unlevered high-teen returns. We will be focusing on improving product returns even further in the coming months. Taking action to significantly improve new business returns, along with the repurchase of $150 million of our shares, reflects our continued focus on capital management and deploying capital at good returns.","We also indicated during the conference that we lowered the amount of certain long-dated guaranteed products. In other words, fewer sales of GUL and VAs with living benefits relative to total sales on a profit-adjusted basis. Despite a temporary spike in VA sales in the second quarter, these long-dated guaranteed products represented about 40% of our product sales in the first half, down from 50% a few years ago. Our midterm plans focus on keeping long-dated guaranteed sales around 30% of total sales. I'm also pleased to report that Moody's upgraded our ratings, and Fitch affirmed them. The agencies site diversified earnings mix, distribution strength and superior risk management as key strengths for Lincoln.","Let me now share from our underlying segments some highlights, staying with the broad themes and starting with individual Life. Second quarter sales in individual Life of $183 million are back to pre-Pivot levels, quite a remarkable accomplishment which speaks to our broad solution set and our powerful distribution capability. Pivot products, which include Variable Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, flexible premium MoneyGuard and term insurance, were up 137% from the same quarter last year. Guaranteed UL sales continued to decline, accounting for just 15% of second quarter sales.","Repricing continued, with new versions of single and joint Life GUL products being introduced in the quarter. Changes to our MoneyGuard product were also introduced, and we will continue to make revisions to boost returns while walking -- working towards the launch of a redesigned product early next year.","In our annuity business, it was a very good quarter. Annuity sales of $4.2 billion drove net flows of $1.7 billion. Account values increased 14%, reaching $103 billion. We anticipated strong VA sales in the second quarter, in part the result of accelerated sales ahead of benefit changes rolled out in May. Average sales volume has declined by roughly 25% of the May run rate, and we expect VA sales to moderate in the last half of the year.","Our risk managed fund strategies on our VA products continue to anchor new deposit flow. Of the $3.9 billion of deposits in the quarter, 80% included a guaranteed living benefit rider built on these strategies. Also, 9% of the deposits had no living benefit guarantees at all. Let me remind you of the significant value that our risk management fund strategies provide to Lincoln and clients alike. These solutions embed volatility management inside client accounts, enhancing account value stability and lowering our hedging costs. In Group Protection, second quarter sales of $95 million increased 7% from the prior year. Our performance remains driven by targeted strategies in the voluntary space and disciplined distribution expansion.","We continue to achieve strong results in the voluntary market. Sales grew by 64% in the second quarter, led by good growth in both new and existing products. Our field force grew by 9% from the prior year, as we keep investing in the group business by making selective hires that complement our emphasis on the voluntary market and that can deliver our broad portfolio of solutions.","As we have shared on the last few calls, we remain diligent in our efforts to achieve strong profitability through new sales, ROE and renewal actions. We are seeing results, with new sales profitability in line with our expectations of 12% plus and renewal actions meeting or exceeding our expectations for both rate increase and persistency.","Moving to Retirement Plan Services, it was another excellent quarter for all leading indicators, with strong total deposits, solid retention results resulting in positive net flows. Second quarter deposits of $1.6 billion were up 25% from a year ago, driven mainly by ongoing momentum in the mid-large market.","Net flows for the quarter were $337 million, up 68% year-over-year. Strong inflows combined with no large terminations contributed to our 8th straight quarter of positive flows and record account values of $47 billion, up 14% from a year ago.","We continue to broaden our market presence through new distribution opportunities. Two notable examples are: we recently expanded our partnership with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, one of the largest distributors of small employee DC plans, through the launch of our small markets solutions. And our Pivot push in the mid-to-large government space is already adding to our sales pipeline. These initiatives, as well as others, will drive further growth of RPS and increase our overall presence in this business.","In distribution, our retail, wholesale and worksite sales teams continue to drive our core strategies and remain, again, a differentiating strength for Lincoln. Annually, we reach more than 65,000 active producers, and that reach is expanding as evidenced by 16% more producers recommending our solutions in the first 6 months of this year versus the same period last year and the expansion of strategic partnerships in the quarter, such as the Merrill Lynch partnership that I just mentioned as well as the introduction of new fixed annuity products for Primerica and JPMorgan Chase.","Selling additional products through our active producer base is the key strategy, with many of our sales initiatives tied to these results. We have seen good traction in the last year. Notably, the number of advisors selling multiple Lincoln products increased by 9%. We will keep making strategic investments in distribution as we look to expand a powerful footprint that already includes 8,400 advisors affiliated through LFN, 600 wholesalers in LFD and approximately 550 representatives within our worksite teams.","Spending a minute on investment management, I want to highlight the quarter's strong alternative investment performance compared to the first quarter. Pretax alternative net annualized return was about 14% in the second quarter compared to 3% last quarter. Our alternatives program has historically produced solid results, albeit variable. Going forward, we expect to see similar results, that being attractive long-term returns with period-to-period volatility.","We have made progress in committing capital to our alternatives program, both private equity and hedge funds, with the carrying value of our alternatives program increasing by more than 20% year-over-year -- as we grow our program from 1% of total assets to about 1.5% of total assets over the course of the next 2 years. At 1.5% of total assets, this is well within our risk appetite and is significantly lower than the average of our peers. We continue to find more yield and select core strategies, such as private placements, direct middle-market loans and commercial mortgage loans, as we have mentioned previously.","Let me close by saying once again that it was an excellent quarter of reported results, with good progress made on actions to build our franchise and expand our growth potential. An environment of slowly rising interest rates, growing stock market, consumer preferences certainty and demographics are powerful tailwinds for our industry and Lincoln, specifically, given our earnings mix.","With that, let me turn things over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $351 million or $1.27 per share for the second quarter, up 17% from the second quarter of 2012. Overall, it was a very strong quarter across all key metrics. Of note, excellent top line performance with operating revenue growth of nearly 6%, up from the 4% to 5% level of recent quarters. Tight management of controllable expenses, with growth in G&A primarily attributable to strong production and share price performance. Adjusting for those 2 items, G&A was up roughly 3%.","Account balances increased to a record level of $189 billion; strong general account performance with realized losses related to investments coming in at a very manageable $22 million and balance sheet strength, with GAAP book equity per share, excluding AOCI, up 13% to $43.21; $693 million of cash at the holding company; an RBC ratio of 485%; $150 million of share buybacks; and return on equity of 12.4% for the quarter. As noted in the press release, we had no normalizing in earnings adjustment in the quarter, but we did quantify $19 million of positive earnings impact from higher-than-expected investment income on prepayment fees. All in all, a very good, clean quarter.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter, which included $9 million of higher-than-expected prepayment fees, came in at a record $195 million, while ROE came in at 26%. Operating revenues increased 11% from the second quarter of 2012, primarily on higher fees, driven by a 15% increase in average account values, to $104 billion.","This was a very good quarter for the annuity business that really exemplifies everything that we covered at our June investor conference: a history of responsible product pricing on VAs, that has put us in a very favorable risk position relative to our peers, with the net amount of risk on both living and death benefit guarantees at roughly 1% of account value; a high quality book of business that has always delivered strong returns that are being pushed to record levels with the strength of the equity markets; a consistent and disciplined approach to controlling new business flows that saw us increase pricing of VA products during the quarter; and a hedge product that continues to deliver excellent performance, with no breakage in the quarter.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $39 million, which included $5 million of higher-than-expected investment income from prepayment fees. Quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 5% benefited from a 9% increase in insurance fees, the result of a 14% increase in average account values.","The success of our Retirement business to attract and retain assets under management continued in the quarter. Account balances at quarter end were $47 billion, a record level and up 14% over the prior year quarter. Interest spread performance for the quarter was strong, coming in at 2.14%, as retirement benefited from the prepayment fees mentioned earlier. Adjusting for this, return on assets came in at 29 basis points, right in line with our expectations.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $135 million included $5 million of excess investment income from prepayment fees. Life earnings drivers continued to grow at a mid single-digit pace, with average account balances up 6%, and Life Insurance In Force up 3%. Interest spreads came in at 1.98%, with the quarter's strong performance benefiting from the prepayment fees mentioned earlier.","Group Protection earned $22 million in the second quarter, which marks a nice turnaround from recent quarters. The non-medical loss ratio returned to the targeted range, coming in at 73.5% for the quarter. I'd attribute the improving loss ratio to strong performance from the disability book as key metrics, such as incidents, continued to perform nicely and an improvement in life mortality from last quarter's elevated levels. The group business is also benefiting from strong premium increases, with renewal pricing up in the mid-single digits during the second quarter. Non-medical premium growth, which came in at 9%, continues a positive trend of high single-digit growth rates, the result of increasing our distribution presence, new product offerings in the voluntary space and pricing increases. There was no change to the discount rate on new claim incurrals, which was reduced to 3.75% in the first quarter.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few items of note. The increase in interest rates will have a positive impact on potential spread compression. Entering 2013, we had had provided guidance, that was the 10-year treasury at 1.5%, that we would experience roughly $100 million of negative earnings impact in 2014. Assuming that the 10-year treasury stays in their current levels, I'd estimate that the negative impact on 2014 results has been reduced to approximately $35 million.","We have also taken advantage of the slope in the forward curve by locking in the underlying treasure rate on another $850 million of future reinvestment needs. Including previous rate locks, we now have in place hedges on over $1.8 billion of future investment needs at an average rate that is roughly 110 basis points in excess of today's rates. The majority of these rate locks are associated with our Guaranteed Universal Life book of business and represent roughly 50% of In-Force GUL cash flows over the next 4 to 5 years.","The Life companies sent $215 million in cash to the holding company during the quarter, while statutory capital and RBC remained level for the quarter at $7.5 billion and 485%, respectively. With $250 billion of share buybacks so far in 2013, we are on track to meet or exceed our beginning of the year guidance for $400 million of capital deployment.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to maybe dig in a little deeper on the rate sensitivity and sort of thinking about kind of reverse sensitivity, namely with the free cash flow coming in higher than your expectations. I know that on the 10-K, you had given some disclosures of roughly $35 million of headwinds that you just talked about in the opening comments as well. What happens if free cash had come in 50 basis points above your estimates or 100 basis points above your estimates? Have you done any sensitivity work on that?","Dennis R. Glass","Yaron, this is Dennis. This is sort of what I was driving at, we're about 85 basis points lower than our portfolio rate. So if -- just rough justice, if rates -- our new investment yields get up to our portfolio rate, that would stop spread compression.","Randal J. Freitag","Yaron, this is Randy. I'll just add -- I want to make sure we're comparing apples and apples. The $35 million you referenced was what we put in the 10-K and it was the impact on 2013 results, with rates at 1.5%. $35 million is my updated estimate for 2014, which is down from $100 million previously. So we've seen a significant reduction and improvement in potential spread compression, because the treasury rates have increased 75 basis points or so.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Understood. But maybe -- so, let's say -- I don't know what your forward estimates are, but let's say that you're actually 50 basis points below or 100 -- whatever number you want to choose, what impact does that have on 2014 numbers?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, we don't give the impact of x basis points. But as Dennis mentioned, we're roughly 80, 85 basis points below our portfolio today, which is -- we've come about halfway, and it's cut the impact substantially. So I would say if you got another 75 basis points or 80 basis points in an increase in treasury rates, you'd see the negative impact across Lincoln eliminated.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And the second -- the follow-up question is on the Retirement business. Clearly, mid-to-large market accounts are growing. Can you give us an update as to what comparative trends you're seeing there and what demand's looking like there?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Overall, I would say that it's a competitive marketplace in the mid-to-large market, rebid activities remain high. We're seeing a little more competition move -- small-market providers move up into the middle market. Pricing pressures sort of continue to be there. In the small market, again becoming more crowded, but we're still getting our fair share. What I'd say, in general, is in the small market, we're achieving our returns, we're getting good growth, we're expanding distribution, we have new systems. We have, again, expanding distribution. So that's a good long-term market, but we need to continue to invest in the expansion of distribution. Again, the shelf space is pretty remarkable, the achievements we've made there. In the mid-to-large market, we have this emphasis in the government space, as I mentioned, that has a good growth characteristics -- a little bit less price sensitive, a little harder to get done. So overall, from Lincoln's perspective, I continue to see pretty good growth in this business and pretty good ROE development. A little tougher in the mid-to-large market to get the returns that we want. But again, I think we have a very good position getting better known in the marketplace for all the achievements that we've made over the last 24 months, and we're pretty positive on the continued growth of that business.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you really centered around Annuities. So if I look at the Annuities segment results this quarter and I strip out those higher prepayments that you mentioned, earnings really jumped about -- I don't know, about 15%, 16% from the average of the past few quarters. I'd expect, I think we would all expect, that higher account values, stronger markets, that the EGPs are higher and that all of sequel, even deck amortization should come down a bit. Maybe you could update us on where you are, how much you expect that deck amortization to be lower than it has been previously. And then within the corridor, given the strong market performance, I know you're already reasonably close to the upper end, where are you know now?","Randal J. Freitag","John, it's Randy. Let me answer your question this way. First, I'm going to compare second quarter to the second quarter of last year, and then I'll talk about the sequential quarter. If you look year-over-year, earnings are up 23% or so, and that's pretty much primarily driven just by AUM growth and the growth in the amount of fees we're collecting per dollar of assets. If you look at average separate accounts year-over-year, they're up 19%, and when you look at what we're getting from an expense assessment standpoint, they're up 6 basis points. Bring those 2 items together and what you see as expense assessments are up 21% year-over-year, and that's pretty much the driver of earnings growth year-over-year. It all makes sense. When you look at the sequential quarter, it's that along with a couple other items that I'll mention. So if you look sequentially, earnings are up 23%, 17% if you strip out the $9 million of strong prepayment fee income. But first and foremost, the driver is strong expense assessment growth. You see average separate accounts at 5%, and you see our average expense rate up another 4 basis points. You bring those 2 things together, you get expense assessment growth of 7% or $27 million, and that's the primary driver of the earnings growth. In addition, what you see is that we had very strong results in our broker dealer during the quarter. I'd attribute that to expense savings from a consolidation we did in our distribution system and the benefit in the retail channel of strong AUM growth, so strong results in our broker dealer, which I believe are repeatable. And third, as I mentioned, is the cum benefit -- the cumulative benefit on deck amortization would have been a period of very strong performance in the equity markets. I believe when you bring all those things together, I'm very comfortable with the annuity earnings in that mid $185 million -- $180 million range.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. That's extraordinary helpful. Then the other question I just had is just to -- Dennis, I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that let's not all get scared that VA sales are -- jumped as much, there was some acceleration in front of your product refresh and benefit change; and that the production levels have come down about 25% from the levels in May, but we don't really know what the levels were in May. I'm assuming they were significantly stronger in the front half of the quarter given the May new product launch. But can you give us a little bit more help there?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, I can. First, let me remind all of us that Lincoln has been -- has had about 1\/5 market share for 5 -- we've been #5 for 5 years. So we've done an exceptionally good job of getting the business on our terms without reaching for market share, and we do that through price changes. If we see the market -- see our demand getting too strong, we'll change prices, as we did in May and of course, we've done consecutively over the last 24 months. Sometimes in a quarter, it's hard to have that same consistent result, in part because competitors are making sharp turns, and we, for a moment in time, might get a little bit more market share from them because they've exited the market or changed their pricing. So my point is that we've done a great job at this over 5 years. This is one quarter when things popped up a little bit. Specifically, it popped up because our -- although we made changes to the benefits on our single Living benefits product, we didn't -- we waited until June to make it -- the product changes on our joint Life products. And just perspective, typically, the joint Life runs about 1\/3 of overall sales. In the second quarter, again, in part because of competitor actions, this jumped up to 54%, so drove a lot of that increase. Again, with the sales -- excuse me, with the pricing changes, we're now back to that product being at its normal 1\/3 level. And just -- you may then ask the question, \"What did we do?\" -- we reduced the payout rates by 50 to 100 basis points for the age 65-74 bands in our joint Life product, and we restricted some other benefits. So that's sort of the big picture. As we look for the second half of the year, we don't expect to see the same volume of sales that we saw in the second quarter. And if because of competitor reactions or just generally strong demand for this product, we see sales inching up above our guidelines, we'll take additional actions. I would like to come back and say that these pricing actions that we're taking are not being taken because the products that we're selling had too low of returns. All of the business that we sold over the last 6 to 7 months are -- we continue to talk about mid-teens to upper-teens returns. Even before we made the product changes, we were getting that on this business. So the stuff that we've sold is good profitable business. It's just that, as I said in my opening remarks, in total, we like to be a business -- we like our long-guaranteed businesses, but we'd like to see it sort of become a smaller part of us over time. So that may be more than you wanted, but that's my answer to your question, okay?","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just have a couple of things. So first, Randy, on your comment on the -- I think it was $1.8 billion of treasury locks that you purchased, does that have any impact on that -- in the past you've talked about this $500 million potential statutory charge on the UL block at some point, kind of 5 years out, maybe a little bit longer. Have we started to chip away at that with some of the actions that you've taken so far, including these treasury locks?","Randal J. Freitag","Suneet, I think anytime you see either the interest rates move up or us take actions to lock in higher rates in the future, it has a benefit on the margin. We continue to feel very comfortable with where our reserves are today and the trend and interest rates. So I feel very comfortable about any pressure on statutory reserves.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess on past calls, you've kind of given us a walk-through of sort of capital generated, what your expectations are inclusive of reserve financing. And I take it by your comment that you continue to try to beat the $400 million -- roughly $400 million of buybacks, that nothing there has really changed? I just wanted to kind of confirm that.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Suneet, nothing there has changed. I'll broaden your question, and I'll talk a little bit about statutory in general, talk about both what has happened over the last 10 quarters. So I think it's very important to look at the reality and then talk about some of the trends I see as we look forward. If you look over in the last 10 quarters, you go back to the end of 2010, we were a company with an RBC ratio of 491%. We were a company with roughly $700 million of capital at the holding company. In the next 10 quarters, we've bought back 1.3 billion of stock at an average price a little below $25. We've delivered by a couple of hundred million dollars, and we've raised our dividend by about 140%. So we've put roughly $600 million of capital to work. And where are we at today? We're a company with an RBC ratio of 485%. We're a company with roughly $700 million of cash in the holding company, right where we started. So the reality is that over the last 10 quarters, we have had a very strong capital deployment story. We continue to have a very strong balance sheet. Now when you come up to today, you look at what we did in the second quarter, we had roughly $200 million of statutory earnings, which is right in line with my expectations. When you think about the things -- when you look forward, we've got the strong equity markets, which are going to continue to help the Annuity earnings. We've got an easing enough spread compression as rates go up, as Dennis talked about, we've repriced all of our products. GUL has fallen from what was 50% to 60% of our sales to 15% of our sales today, and that's our most capital-intensive product. In addition, we just repriced that product in the second quarter to make it much more in line with today's reserve regime. So, the trends when I look forward are very positive. So this year, just as said in my script, we're very comfortable that we can meet or exceed the $400 million, and the trends, I think, as you go up beyond that are very favorable on statutory.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it, helpful. Maybe just one last follow-up question either for Randy or for Dennis. Just thinking about your share repurchase program, a year ago plus, your stock was at, I don't know, 60%, 70% of book value, something like that, and the accretion from buybacks was significant. Now with your stock now getting closer to book value x AOCI, how do you and how does the board think about that trade-off between -- in the past, you've talked about the implied return on buybacks versus things like acquisitions. Obviously, that implied return will potentially narrow as the stock price goes up. So how do you think about that trade-off?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, on the lighter side, it's certainly more fun to buy our stock back at $20 when it moves to $42 or $43 quickly. But as the stock approaches the book value, the return that we would expect is different from share repurchases. So I don't think necessarily that means we will do less as we move forward, but the return on that needs to be compared to returns on every other use of capital. But right now, I think Randy's guidance is pretty good. We're going to continue to buy our shares back, but the return has to be put into the broader perspective of other uses. And at the moment, we're generating excess capital. We think continuing to buy our shares even at this price is a good idea. I still contend that, using the metric of price book progression, we're still $8 to $11 less than what we should be before we just get normal market appreciation. So long answer is sure, as the price increases and the return on potential purchases goes down, we have to look at that, but there's nothing I can see right now that would change the plans that Randy's just outlined.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Krueger of Dowling & Partners.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","My first question was on life mortality. Could you just talk about how it was in the quarter relative to your expectations and maybe the actual to expected metric that you've given in the past?","Randal J. Freitag","Ryan, yes. Life mortality, as we noted, improved to right in line with our expectations. Remember the first quarter, we talked about an a-to-e of 86%. If you look at the second quarter of last year, that number was 80%. And when we came into this quarter, we're right in line with that 80%. I think, mathematically, we came in at 81%, but that's right in line with the expected range of mortality.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay, great. And then on the change in the sensitivity to low interest rates, about $100 million in '14 going down to $35 million, was that purely due to the increase in higher interest rates? Or does that also incorporate some of the proactive steps that you've taken so far along the way that impacted some of this guidance that you've given in the past?","Randal J. Freitag","I think it reflects both of those items. I'd also note that, just factually, if you go back to the $100 million guidance at the beginning of the year, 2 of those quarters have passed, right? So there's 2 quarters of impact that are in our results right now, and the $35 million is an estimate relative to what we just reported in the second quarter. So you've got some that's already in our results, so that's some of the impact. I'd call that $20 million to $25 million. But the rest of the impact is primarily attributable to the increase in interest rates and then a little bit the proactive things we've done.","Ryan Krueger - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","That's it. And then just one last one, just on -- back to the discussion of share repurchase and M&A. Just wondering if as interest rates have come up, if you've seen any change in the M&A type of activity going on behind the scenes?","Dennis R. Glass","We continue to be -- well, you all know we've built Lincoln, old Lincoln, old JP, with thoughtful well-priced, well-executed executions. The people sitting around the table here are the same people who've done those successfully. We have a strength, which if the right circumstances occur, we wouldn't be -- we would do a deal. I would have to say right now, though, that it's -- the activity is not anywhere in what we would find of interest. And so at the moment, what's in front of us, what's out in the marketplace, what might be coming down the road, there doesn't seem to be too much that would be of interest to us. And again, some of the deals that have been done recently have been done at very low discount rates, my view, and we're just not going to do that.","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so some of my questions were answered, but just maybe one on variable annuities. Dennis, like even if the business shrinks a little bit in the third quarter, it's still actually growing faster than other parts of your business. And is there a point at which variable annuities get too large as a percentage of your business mix that you decide to take a little bit more of a drastic action and maybe reduce the growth there? And then what would that point be if there is one? And then secondly, on your disability business, the margins had steadily improved the last few quarters. This quarter, the loss ratio went up about 1%, still decent overall but was wondering whether that's -- you're seeing any deterioration in losses or is that just normal loss in claims trends?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. I think I'll take the first one and give the second one to Randy. The -- we are modulating our -- moderating our VA sales to a level that I think is maintainable over a fairly long horizon, and that's in part because we're growing other parts of the business as well. I'd also like to make the comment -- we talk about annuities as a business. Number 1, you've got to pull out fixed and variable dynamics and the earnings impacts over time. Those 2 things are different. I think of our total variable annuity -- excuse me, of our total annuity earnings, about 25% is on the fixed side. But then even stepping back farther, the lines of business, you're calling it annuities, are a good indicator to me of how we source liabilities in the business. It reflects sort of the nature of our liabilities, but I don't look at the businesses per se as the final criteria on earnings mix. What I've been focusing you all on is the balance of capital market businesses and mortality and morbidity businesses. So again, back to what I said earlier, it's our goal to -- well, I didn't say this, but I will. We get about 1\/3 from equity charges across all of our business lines. Of our earnings, we get about 1\/3 from interest spreads and maybe, at this moment, about 25% from mortality and morbidity. The goal is to change that mix more towards mortality and morbidity and then to lower the percentage of sales in the long duration of products. And I would say that these are midterm goals over the next couple of years, and I'm pretty confident of both the market and again, the quality of our distribution. I mean, to me it's pretty -- it's a pretty decent business, some good examples of the strength of our model. We talked today about taking Universal Life sales, which were running 60% to 70% of total Life sales, down to 15% in the space of 24 months and by the way, now back at the same levels of sales we were when we started that Pivot. If you look at what we've done in the VA business, we were selling no protective strategy funds. It went from 0% to 80%, because our distribution was able to drive those results. So as we set our sights on more crisp business mix and product mix objectives, I'm pretty confident, based on our history, that we'll get there. So this a long story to say that the business mix is going to be moved more towards mortality and morbidity. I think that mix will improve our share price performance over both economic and capital market cycles, and I think we have the wherewithal to do it. Okay?","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then on disability?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. On the DI loss ratios, we didn't see any trend of deterioration in the quarter. It was a very strong quarter in the DI business. I think broader picture in the group business, there is some seasonality in the different businesses that moves in opposite ways, actually. You'll see DI incidents trend up a little bit over the course of the year. On the other hand, you'll see dental incidents trend down, and you'll see mortality typically improve in the last half of the year. So you've got these things that work against each other. But all in, very happy with the group results in the quarter and feel good about us moving forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Two. First, with regards to the interest rate guidance, Randy, just so I'm understanding this, I had historically thought of the guidance as, okay, 2013 interest rates, that's going to hurt you by $35 million. And if you think in 2014 that Lincoln's earnings were going to grow 9%, to pick a number -- grow them out 9% and then kick off another $65 million, so $65 million, $35 million, equal to $100 million. Now I'm thinking about it, okay, so we have the $35 million, and I'm not even sure if it's still $35 million for this year. You didn't say anything about that Randy, so if you could touch on that. And then it's going to be -- if I'm going to grow out earnings for Lincoln 9% -- $35 million less $35 million is zero. I'm going to keep it at 9%. Is that the right way to think about this?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, let me try to walk through that. First off, as I mentioned, $35 million was a number coming into the year, full year impact. Two quarters are behind us, so there's some level of impact from spread compression in our second quarter results. But as we've been saying all along, we've -- there are lots of levers we pull to manage interest spread compression. So we've been managing expenses. We've got favorable impacts from the equity market. So we have this very strong second quarter, which includes some level of spread compression impact, primarily in the Life business and the Retirement business. Now as you move forward, you'll see a small quarterly impact that will total up to $35 million, as I mentioned next year. Last half of the year, it's a relativity small number, it's a single-digit number in the second half of the year, relative to what we reported in the second quarter. And it says nothing of the fact that we will continue to do everything we can to manage the bottom line impact of that spread compression.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And then one -- I had to go on to something else, so I apologize. If I missed this, just let me know, and I'll check the transcript. But I am interested in the Retirement Plan Services, particularly the success in the mid-to-large market. And it wasn't clear to me from Dennis' statement whether that was being driven by government or whether that was being driven by 401(k) or by teachers. And it's our understanding, I think, that mid and certainly, large is the -- probably the most competitive of the areas in the defined benefit business. So maybe you can touch on what you're seeing there competition wise?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. In the mid-to-large market, progress to date has been made by virtue of 2 things. One, we -- well, many things, but if I can spike out 2 things. One, we have a new platform. Before we had the new platform, we weren't on any of the consultant lists, or we weren't on as many as we needed to be. So once we got the new platform in place, the number of consultants who drive this mid-to-large business started taking notice of Lincoln. So that's number one. Number two, accessing the consultants requires feet on the street, and over the last 18 months, we've increased that, okay? Our product is as good as anybody's product, so -- but now we have access to consultants because of the overall mix of our business. If I remember correctly, some of our business that we've been putting on the books comes from our expertise in the healthcare area, which has been a good growth area. So that sort of brings us up to today. The government market is a new initiative that we started in the last 90 to -- maybe 6 months. And the pipeline for new sales, whether or not we can close it, we'll see, has a lot of that business in it. So going forward, we expect an additional push from the government market. But so far, it's come from improving our platform, getting in front of more consultants, expanding the sales force that calls on the consultants.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is the government market particularly price sensitive, Dennis?","Dennis R. Glass","The -- I guess the toughest place that we're finding to get well north of 10% on new business returns is in this mid-to-large market. I think the government may be a little bit less price sensitive, but it's less so than the 401(k) market.","Operator","Our next question is from Seth Weiss of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the Annuities business and the sustainability of sort of that mid-180s run rate that you mentioned, Randy. And just thinking about it from an ROE standpoint, if I normalize out the $10 million or so of higher investment income, we're still getting to an ROE of about 25% for the quarter, which is a pretty big jump quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year, than what we've seen in the last 4 or 5 quarters. So I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that, that you're comfortable with the sort of the $185 million as a normalized run rate to start from here. And maybe help us understand where the leverage is that makes for this pretty drastic increase in the ROE looking at that segment.","Randal J. Freitag","Sure, Seth. Well, first off, yes, I am comfortable with the mid-180s for all of the reasons that I went through before relative to the second quarter, relative -- second quarter of last year, relative to the first quarter. This is driven by good solid AUM growth, good solid performance in our broker dealer and the powerful benefit on deck amortization of all of those items. So yes, very comfortable in the mid-180s. From a return standpoint, the 24%, 25% ROE that you referenced to which you normalize out the prepayment fees, that's just the end result of a business that was very well protected as we came through the last 4 to 5 years. I think what you see at a lot of companies is companies that weren't protected -- didn't have hedge programs in place coming into the crisis and had to build those hedge programs at costs that are probably twice what we had to spend to put that hedge program in place. That is the key component which differentiates our returns from other companies. And there are a couple other companies out there, I won't name names, who have similar returns. Those happen to also be the companies that have very powerful, robust and deep hedge programs coming into the crisis. That is the key differentiator. So yes, very comfortable with the 180s, very comfortable with the ROEs that we're reporting.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess just one follow-up. I'm thinking about sort of new business returns in -- VA was a business that was, in terms of business mix, was obviously quite out of vogue just a year ago. Now with the S&P over 1,700, returns are looking better, as you mentioned. Is -- some of the legacy business run over the last 2, 3 years probably has pretty good returns. Is new business maybe at a slightly lower ROE when we think about kind of the run rate of this going forward? Still maybe above 20%, but this 25% is probably not the right level to think of as new business? Is that fair to say?","Dennis R. Glass","That's sort of difficult to predict. In my remarks, I said we were pricing new business today at unlevered returns of 19%. If you add leverage to that, you still get into the low 20s on the balance sheet.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Our last question is from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Dennis, the -- what would appear to be a -- there appears to be a growing interest, not a stable interest but a growing interest, on the part of the public, both institutions -- both individuals and institutions, in tax efficiency and in flow fees. We see this is in the growing share of passive strategies in the asset management business. Annuities kind of go in the opposite direction from that trend. They tend to be tax inefficient, converting capital gains into ordinary income, I believe, when the money is distributed. And the fees on them were dramatically higher in most instances than on the next based alternatives. Why do you think that this extraordinary growth that we've seen over the last decade and more in guarantees can be sustained given this trend? And relatedly, this whole longevity business that you're in and that the whole industry is in right now and is benefiting from, why should we think that the life insurance industry will prevail? And I realize in the context of this call, you all have only 1 minute or 2 to answer. It's something that we should probably get into more detail off line. But even if you want to answer briefly, why should we think that the life insurance industry is going to prevail over competitors, such as banks and asset managers, who are as equally aware of the longevity trends as you life insurers are?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, there is a lot in your question that we probably should take -- we ought to have a 2-hour lunch, but let's just come back to what happened during the crisis. Precrisis, in terms of preferences for products, does have more certainty. Prior to the crisis, everybody thought that the stock markets would forever increase. Then we had the crisis. People lost a lot of money, unfortunately, as we all know and read. Individual investors don't have a very good track record of market timing. So I think the broad statistic on that is individual investors' performance is 2% to 3% less than the overall growth in the S&P 500. So they're not particularly good in -- at it, and again, I think it comes from the market's decline. People get nervous, and they sell when they should hold. But in any event, so the individual investor hasn't had a good track record. He or she has seen the markets collapse, and their earnings collapsed likewise. I remember during the crisis, people started returning the 401(k)s as 201(k)s. And so there's been a pretty dramatic move in the preference of individuals to have some part of their portfolio invested in something that has more certainty. And I think that's going to continue, and that's why we think, in the right amounts, at the right returns, the VA business will continue to grow. With respect to the life insurance markets, some of that -- life insurance products has -- have a variety of uses, but the state taxes aren't going away, so the state tax declining will remain an objective. Young families that want to provide protection in the case of the breadwinner dying prematurely are going to continue to buy life insurance. So I think the fundamental needs of Americans for life insurance are going to continue to be very popular over the next decade. And again, as we've said and as you've seen in our competitors' reports, and none of us can predict or see that this is going to continue the way it has, but a good growing stock market and slowly rising interest rates has got to be absolutely the best economic climate for the insurance industry on top of the demand that we're talking about. Okay?","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln\u2019s website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today\u2019s call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris. good morning, everyone. Fourth quarter results were strong with operating earnings per share up 12% compared to last year. This capped a record year, which included a 20% increase in EPS, a 13% increase in book value per share and a 13% ROE.","As you know, we have a multi-year track record of strong financial results and importantly, we believe these results are sustainable over time as we continue to build our franchise and stay keenly focused on profitable growth and capital management. Let me briefly touch on the impact each of these in 2017 as well as some forward-looking thoughts.","First, growth. Our powerful retail franchise, which brings together a broad product portfolio with distribution breadth is driving growth across all four businesses. Each generated sales or deposit gains of 6% to 12%. This includes an increase in annuity sales for the first time since 2013, the highest level of life sales in a decade, back to back years of growth in Group Protection sales and record in RPS deposits.","The near-term sales outlook is encouraging, and we are also positioning Lincoln to further capitalize on long-term opportunities, including annuities with fee-based compensation options, linked benefit products, smaller faced term insurance and employee-paid group benefits.","When looking at profitability, this year\u2019s strong earnings were broad-based, as annuities, RPS and group all reported increases in operating earnings of at least 15%. Excluding notable items in both periods, Life Insurance also reported double-digit growth. Given this positive momentum, coupled with the impact of lower tax rates, earnings growth this year should remain robust for each business.","Lastly, capital management. In 2017, solid capital generation enabled us to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders. Buybacks were completed at an average price under $70 per share, more than 20% below the current share price, while we also announced a 14% increase in the common stock dividend.","Subsequent to year-end, we announced our intention to acquire Liberty\u2019s Group business. This transaction provides several strategic and financial benefits and also optimizes the balance sheet by using excess capital and leverage capacity not otherwise available for share repurchases. Looking forward, capital management will remain an important part of the Lincoln story.","Now turning to the business line, starting with Individual Life. Earnings were once again sound, consistent with the prior year quarter and contributed a solid finish to a strong year. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $242 million were up 5% from the prior year, as results benefited from Executive Benefit sales and gains in VUL and term combined with continued strong demand for MoneyGuard.","For the full year, total Life Insurance sales increased 8% to nearly $800 million, again, the highest level in a decade, as we benefit from a broad product portfolio and distribution breadth, hallmarks of Lincoln. In addition, prior pricing actions and a unique ability to adapt resulted in returns on new business coming in at the top end of our 12% to 15% targeted returns.","We continue to focus on balancing sales diversification, risk management, growth and appropriate returns on new business. To this point, a more favorable macro backdrop is allowing us to improve our competitive position in UL and IUL. This will help with sales diversification and growth, while still enabling us to achieve targeted returns.","Quickly on the impact of tax reform on Life Insurance products. We see limited impact. Our core accumulation and protection products, along with linked benefit solutions, remain critically important to protecting the basic needs of Americans.","Life Insurance will also remain an important solution for the estate planning as the estate tax remains in place, although subject to a larger exclusion, which is scheduled to go away after 2025. Randy will provide some perspectives on the impact to the pricing of new business, which we would expect to result in more sales over time, not less.","Bottom line, the outlook for the Life Insurance business remains strong, and we expect growth to continue, driven by unmatched product diversification and our market leadership position combined with the depth and breadth of distribution.","Turning to Group. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year quarter, driven by favorable loss ratios and a 5% increase in premiums. For the full year, margins were within our 5% to 7% margin target, a year ahead of plan. Fourth quarter sales of $265 million were up modestly and full year sales grew 7%, as all product lines in both employer and employee-paid sales contributed to the growth.","We are also encouraged by persistency trends, which improved four percentage points in 2017, driven by stronger renewal trends in core life and disability products. As I noted a couple of weeks ago, we are very pleased with the agreement to acquire Liberty\u2019s Group business.","By combining forces, we meaningfully increase our scale, further broaden our customer base and distribution channels and expand our capabilities. Going forward, I expect this transaction will accelerate the already strong positive momentum in the group business.","Turning to Annuities. We posted strong operating results in the fourth quarter, as earnings increased 10% and for the full year, exceeding $1 billion, driven by our high- quality and predictable in-force business, combined with equity market tailwinds. Total annuity sales were strong in the fourth quarter, up 54% to $2.8 billion as we experienced significant gains in both variable and fixed annuities.","Recall, we laid out our strategy last year to restore sales in the annuity business. This plan focuses on our ongoing playbook of combining product actions and distribution effectiveness. After seeing encouraging trends early in the year, momentum accelerated post summer as wholesalers effectively leveraged and expanded product portfolio to regain market share. When combined with an improved sales backdrop, post-DOL delay, we experienced the best sales quarter in two years.","Notably, the sales strength was broad-based with growth across all product categories, all distribution channels and both qualified and non-qualified markets. Digging deeper into product categories, sales variable annuities with living benefit guarantees were up 62% compared to the prior year quarter and represented just over half of total annuity sales. VA\u2019s with risk managed funds remain the largest contributor to annuity sales with newer products, which provide more investment flexibility and payout options are enabling us to reach more customers and advisors while also diversifying our sales mix.","VA sales without living benefits increased 35% year-over-year and were consistently strong throughout 2017, as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning continue to resonate with consumers. Fixed annuity sales increased 57% versus the prior year quarter, as the reinsurance arrangement with Athene improved our competitive position in the bank and broker-dealer channels, where we have a distribution advantage.","So a strong quarter for the annuity business as the annuity sales action plan took a big step forward and resulted in full year sales increasing for the first time since 2013. Looking ahead, we\u2019ll be adding even more products and distribution in 2018. We expect to see some seasonality but remain confident in the ability to meaningfully increase sales this year and build on an impressive track record of growth and profitability. In Retirement Plan Services, earnings increased significantly in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Total deposits for the quarter were $2.4 billion. This capped a very strong year with total deposits up 12% to a record $8.6 billion. The solid gain in deposits was due to a 29% increase in first year sales as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results and recurring deposits continue to grow.","Net flows for the quarter were $412 million and marked the eighth consecutive quarter of positive flows. For the full year, net flows totaled $1.3 billion, more than double the prior year, and marked the first time annual net flows exceeded $1 billion. Strategies to improve wholesaler productivity, initiatives to increase employee contributions and investments into our customer experience remain the key drivers of a solid momentum.","Looking ahead to 2018, we expect another year of strong flows. So RPS had a great year, 2017 with a double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings. These results highlight the strength of our business model, which is positioned to effectively compete in our target markets and leverage distribution strength to further accelerate growth. And briefly on investment results, the alternative investments portfolio had positive performance for the quarter from both private equity and hedge funds, although below our target return for the full year, which achieved a 12% pretax annualized return above our 10% target and grew the portfolio to $1.5 billion. We invested new money at an average yield of 3.9% in the quarter.","For the full year, we put new money to work at 4%, 25 basis points above 2016 and consistent with projections from Investor Day, where we noted spread compression will continue to abate. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, broadly diversified and high quality with an average crediting rate of A-, investment-grade assets represent nearly 96% of the fixed income portfolio, up one percentage point from the prior year quarter.","So I am pleased with our solid fourth quarter results and record operating EPS in 2017. We entered the new year with a lot of positive momentum. Notably, organic growth drivers are strong, as annuity sales momentum accelerated in the fourth quarter and the other businesses, once again produced solid results. Given our leading distribution and broad set of customer solutions, we expect these trends to continue. When combined with expense discipline, these key drivers of financial success remain well within our control.","We also expect benefit from our recently announced acquisition of Liberty\u2019s Group business, which will enable us to increase earnings in an attractive market and add more balance to total earnings. Lastly, external factors that started the year as tailwinds, equity markets are strong and interest rates are higher. Furthermore, we expect an ongoing benefit from tax reform. In closing, we are very proud of our long-term financial performance and I am confident that our key strategic objectives and initiatives will enable this to continue.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $440 million or $1.98 per share for the fourth quarter, a 12% increase from the prior year. Net income totaled $860 million or $3.67 per share, as results included a couple of nonrecurring items. The largest item was a $1.3 billion increase in our book value from the impact on our deferred tax liability as a result of tax reform.","Partially offsetting this benefit was a $905 million noncash impairment of goodwill in the Life business. This is directly attributable to the tax reform driven increase in our book value, which is an immediate undiscounted impact, whereas the increase in fair value is a discounted impact. Additionally, you may be aware that the FASB is eliminating Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test beginning in 2020.","Therefore, while we again comfortably passed Step 2 of our goodwill impairment test, we wanted to give you the most complete picture of the balance sheet post tax reform. So we early adopted the accounting change. Now let me touch on the performance of key financial metrics. For the full year, reported operating EPS of $7.79 was a record and up 20%. Our EPS, excluding notable items, was also a record, up 16%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 13% to $64.62. Operating return on equity was strong at nearly 13% in the quarter. For the full year, ROE increased 110 basis points to 13.1%.","Sales growth in all segments helped drive a 5% increase in operating revenues. Positive consolidated net flows combined with equity market strength, led to record account values of $253 billion. Our capital generation and balance sheet remain important sources of strength and enabled us to return nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders for the full year. Year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy, and we do not anticipate any reserve deficiencies.","Further highlighting the strength of our balance sheet, all of the rating agencies recently affirmed our credit ratings following the announced acquisition of Liberty\u2019s Group business. Before shifting to segment results, let me spend a few minutes discussing the implications of tax reform on our financials, as well as provide some additional perspectives. First, as I already noted, there was a one-time impact to our GAAP deferred tax liability and goodwill.","Next, tax reform will provide an ongoing benefit to Lincoln. We estimate our GAAP effective tax rate will be in the 15% to 17% range over the near-term. This includes a range of 14% to 16% for annuities, 15% to 17% for RPS, 19% to 21% for Life Insurance and 21% for Group Protection.","Shifting to statutory. We estimate we will end the year with an RBC ratio of 488%, which includes an approximate 15 percentage point impact from a reduction in the statutory deferred tax assets. Our overall capital position is strong as statutory surplus stands at $9.2 billion, up $400 million from the prior year.","Our RBC ratio next year could be affected by an increase in required capital due to the change in tax rates on after-tax RBC factors. We estimate this could impact the RBC ratio by about 60 percentage points. I would note that this is contingent on NAIC action to change RBC factors to reflect the reduction in the tax rates. And we also believe the NAIC would consider taking a more holistic view and make refinements to calculations, which could reduce the RBC impact.","The last financial item I want to cover is free cash flow. Based on 2017 earnings, our long-term free cash flow target of 50% to 55% implies approximately $850 million to $950 million in annual capital generation. We do not anticipate any material change to our absolute free cash flow generation or capital management strategy as a result of tax reform.","Finally, let me provide some viewpoints on in-force profitability and new business pricing. As you know, all of our earnings are generated in the United States and the majority comes from capital-intensive, long-duration liabilities. As a result, a vast majority of the increase in after-tax earnings should persist for the foreseeable future. We would expect to gradually pass through the lower tax rate into new business pricing, however, the annual impact to earnings should be modest.","As we discussed on the Liberty acquisition call a couple of weeks back, shorter duration products, like group benefits, are likely to be impacted sooner, while life and annuity products will be very gradual, given our strong and persistent in-force. It is also important to recognize that more favorable pricing would make all of our customer solutions even more attractive. This should accelerate top and ultimately bottom line growth.","Now turning to segments and starting with Life Insurance. Earnings of $152 million in the quarter were strong, consistent with the prior year quarter. Both periods included favorable mortality results. For the full year, we experienced good mortality with actual to expected coming in at 99%, mirroring the prior year. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 9 basis points for the full year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed.","Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter with average account balances up 7% and Life Insurance in-force up 4%. Overall, this year\u2019s earnings were solid, up 4% on a reported basis or 11%, excluding the impact of notable items. Strong sales results and steady driver growth continue to support earnings momentum.","Group Protection reported $20 million in earnings compared to $16 million in the prior year quarter. Overall, business momentum remains solid with favorable risk results and accelerating top line growth leading to a 25% increase in earnings. Notably, this strong growth was held back by a few items, including higher variable costs, which reflect both seasonality and performance-based expenses combined with slightly higher amortization. In total, I estimate this negatively impacted Group Protection by $7 million.","The non-medical loss ratio was 67.1% in the quarter, a 380 basis point improvement from the prior year, attributable to better loss experience and long-term disability, driven by lower incidents and lower new claim severity. For the full year, loss ratios were steady or better than the prior year in every product line, which contributed to a 50% increase in annual earnings.","Premium growth is also aiding the group business as premiums increased 5% from the prior year quarter, with leading indicators, such as sales and persistency trending in a positive direction. So overall an excellent year for the group business. We expect this positive momentum to continue in 2018 as we close and begin to integrate Liberty\u2019s Group business.","In annuities, earnings for the quarter were $265 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth is driven by higher fee income from a 9% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows.","Operating leverage was strong in the quarter, as solid double-digit revenue growth resulted in an expense ratio improving nearly 100 basis points. Return metrics remained strong. ROA in the quarter was 78 basis points, while ROE came in at 21%, both consistent with the prior year quarter. Notably, return on equity has averaged 20% for a decade and net amount at risk remains low across all vintages and well below most competitors. All of which highlights our differentiated and high-quality annuity book.","So the annuity business had another strong year, with reported earnings up 15% and 8%, excluding notable items in both periods. The year culminated with a significant improvement in annuity sales, and we expect to carry this momentum into 2018.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $41 million compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in earnings was primarily due to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $1.3 billion for the full year combined with favorable equity markets drove average account values to $66 billion, a 15% increase.","Base spreads, excluding variable investment compressed 10 basis points for the full year at the low-end of our guidance range. Fourth quarter revenue increased 6% while G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were up just about 1%. ROA was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter.","2017 was a great year for the retirement business highlighted by consistently strong earnings and returns. The combination of good top line momentum and disciplined expense management leaves RPS well positioned for future earnings growth.","So to conclude, 2017 was an excellent year. Operating EPS was a record and up 20%. Book value per share stands at nearly $65, an all-time high and up 13% and ROE exceeded 13%. This year\u2019s strong performance follows a five-year period where EPS has increased at an annual rate of 11%, book value per share has increased at a 10% rate and our ROE has expanded 70 basis points.","As we look forward, earnings momentum is strong and tax reform provides an ongoing earnings benefit and should also enable us to make products more attractive to consumers. The balance sheet remains strong and our ability to generate capital is firmly intact. Bottom line, we are well positioned to continue delivering strong financial results.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up and re-queue for additional questions.","With that, let me turn it over to Chelsea.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. First, I want to clarify your comments about projected capital generation following on tax reform. And should we take your comment as the 50% to 55% ratio of GAAP earnings is unchanged or that the absolute dollar amount of capital generation should be consistent with prior expectations?","Randy Freitag","It\u2019s the latter, Erik. The dollar amount of capital generation, $850 million to $950 million, is what I would focus in on. Just as a reminder, we\u2019ve done a little better than that the last couple of years, as we state, we have a target and we do everything we can to exceed that. We\u2019ve got some things we\u2019ve been able to leverage the last couple of years to go a little better, but I\u2019d focus in on the dollar amount.","Erik Bass","Thanks. And given the timing differences between cash and GAAP taxes, does that change over time?","Randy Freitag","No. I think you pointed out, there is a difference between cash taxes and GAAP taxes. There\u2019s a small impact on our cash taxes but not enough, where I would say it\u2019s really have any ability on our \u2013 it has any impact on our ability to generate the numbers I talked about that $850 million to $950 million.","Erik Bass","Thanks. And then finally, just given the strong sales momentum you have in life and now, in annuities, do you expect to allocate more capital to growth than you have in recent years? Should we assume more capital, I guess, going to growth and less to buybacks has been the case recently?","Dennis Glass","I think as we mentioned in the past, one of the items we leveraged over the last couple of years was a reduction in annuity sales. We put that capital to work. So as sales go up, there will naturally be a more capital allocated. Once again, not to the point where I would change the dollar amount of free cash flow that I expect us to generate.","I\u2019d point out in all our products also. We\u2019ve done everything we can over the last five years or so to make them as efficient as possible from a capital required standpoint. You especially see this on the Life business with the mix of sales we have today much lower GUL sales, for instance, having brought the amount of capital required to issue that business down pretty substantially over the past five years.","Erik Bass","All right. Thank you.","Dennis Glass","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jimmy Bhullar","Hi, good morning. First, you might have noticed just \u2013 the announcement by MetLife on issues related to benefits payments and its group annuity business. Have you looked at your business and do you have any comments on whether or not you\u2019ve identified similar issues in your group or payout annuity business?","Dennis Glass","Yes, Jimmy. I see no connection to that issue in Lincoln. We\u2019re primarily in the business of accumulation annuities. Any payment issues we would have were dealt with a few years ago when we went through the unclaimed property process. We\u2019ve invested significantly in our ability to make sure that everybody is getting the dollars they are owed by Lincoln. And so have no expectations of an impact here.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just on the Liberty Mutual business, you expect, obviously, margins to go up, and I guess in the next two to three years as you re-priced the book. How should we think about or how much business are you \u2013 in your planning, are you assuming that you will lose as you raise prices just to get an expected decline in persistency or sales?","Randy Freitag","Jimmy, as we mentioned on the call, as we price that deal, one of the things that were so attractive to us was \u2013 is that there is a very little overlap between where we sell at Lincoln and where Liberty sells. And so in terms of sales, we think there\u2019s a little bit of noise, but the dissynergies you would typically see in a transaction, we just don\u2019t see. From persistency standpoint, we also priced in a little bit of persistency noise, but once again, not much. The persistency in that large case market is typically higher than the small to mid, where Lincoln is specialized. So we did price in some impacts, I would say that those dissynergies were modest compared to what we would have priced in prior deals we\u2019ve looked at.","Jimmy Bhullar","Okay. And then just lastly, if I could ask one more. Just on annuity flow, have you seen significant improvement in your sales? Are you expecting annuity sales or net flows in the annuity business to be positive in 2018 as a whole or by the end of the year?","Dennis Glass","The improvements give us more confidence in getting to breakeven net flows sooner than we have thought, but we\u2019re still watching the sales. And as 2018 develops, we\u2019ll be more firm in our expectations.","Jimmy Bhullar","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Josh Shanker","Yes. Good morning, everybody. At the investor meeting that you guys conducted at the end of last year, you talked about getting into the index variable annuity market. I\u2019m wondering what the market outlook for that? When you plan to launch it? And is there a risk that it cannibalizes other items that you might be selling? What the P&L impact of selling that product versus something else you sell?","Dennis Glass","Yes. The answer is we expect to be in the market, I think in May. And we think the value proposition of an index variable annuity is very different from the other products, both variable and fixed, that we have in the marketplace. So we view that predominantly as an addition, not a replacement of existing sales.","Josh Shanker","Is the customer who\u2019s purchasing it as a suite with other things they\u2019re buying or is it a different kind of customer?","Dennis Glass","Perhaps both, there will be new customers that are attracted to the value proposition. And yes, they\u2019ll compare it to the other products and value propositions that are in the marketplace. But again, it is very \u2013 but it\u2019s a very vibrant market already, and so us participating in a market with our distribution and capability should broaden the market and possibly will take some share.","Josh Shanker","And how long would you take \u2013 you think it would take to get it ramped up to where it has an effect on your earnings?","Dennis Glass","I think that \u2013 we actually think that this is going to ramp up pretty significantly over the next 24 months, so incremental contributions to earnings might be out a little late.","Josh Shanker","Okay. Well, thank you very much. Good luck.","Dennis Glass","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. First question, Randy, the $90 million per year contributions that you\u2019ve been making to your New York subsidiary for SGUL, I believe 2017 was the last year that those contributions were supposed to run through. I just wanted to see if that\u2019s right or if there\u2019s still going to be some tail on those contributions. And if so, does that mean you\u2019re now able to generate an extra $90 million a year of capital?","Randy Freitag","Yes, 2017 is the final year. The answer to that second question is no. If you remember, we did a reinsurance transaction a couple of years ago in Lincoln of New York and that reinsurance transaction has taken away that strength. And so while we\u2019ve been putting up the $90 million in reserves, it\u2019s been going out as part of this reinsurance transaction.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. So no financial implications, may be other than the cost of that reinsurance no longer needing to use that for additional strength.","Randy Freitag","Correct.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then my follow-up is, I just want to be clear, I understand this. The coinsurance deal you have with Athene looks like for the quarter that generated something like $200 million to $250 million of sales for you all. Does that \u2013 A, is that right? Is that the right number? And B, does that mean the aggregate sales that are being generated is more like $500 million and you\u2019re keeping half of that as part of coinsurance? Or do I not have that right?","Dennis Glass","The total \u2013 so it\u2019s not half of the total of sales, it\u2019s the total sales. But as you recall, Tom, the profitability on what we retain is, over time, almost as much as if we sold the full amount without the reinsurance.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. So Dennis, the total amount of the sale would be the $200 million to $250 million, is that directionally, correct?","Dennis Glass","It is about $300 million Tom.","Tom Gallagher","300, okay.","Dennis Glass","But again the profitability on our portion of the \u2013 about half of the $300 million is as nearly as much of what we would have made in the traditional non-reinsurance basis, so the $300 million.","Tom Gallagher","And Dennis, would you say the $300 million, is that a decent run rate? Is it accelerating? Because I know it's relatively new.","Randy Freitag","Tom I am reluctant to talk about a specific product and run rates. And if I could back us up sort of the top line, as Randy and I both reported, we've sold out $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter. About $500, $550 million or 20% of that is from new products that we've introduced, either late in 2016, in the middle of 2017.","As I mentioned, we have additional product introductions coming this year. So I would take confidence, personally, the strength of distribution \u2013 I know you've got to say this a lot the breadth of our distribution, new product introductions, being on top of the market will consistently help us grow sales.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open. Mr. Krueger your line is now open. And due to no response, we'll go to the next question. Our next question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. So on last quarter's call, Dennis, you gave us kind of a look in to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter with respect to variable annuity sales, it is good to see that come through. Has that momentum continued into 2018?","Dennis Glass","Lets first talk about seasonality. Fourth quarter is typically higher sales for most of our product lines than the first quarter, so adjusting out for that fact, I would say that all of the things that we have in place continue to encourage us that our annuity sales in total will continue to show growth in 2018.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just on the Group Protection, I guess can you help us think through \u2013 I think on the Liberty benefit call, Liberty Mutual call, you talked about price adjusting for a lower tax rate. Can you just give us a sense of what your expectation is in terms of how much pricing would come down because of the tax rate change?","Dennis Glass","I don\u2019t have that precise open answer with respect to tax at the moment. But I would like to come back to Randy's statement, which is that over time, we expect to get to our 5% to 7% margins, and there will be a number of factors that combined to get us to the 5% to 7%.","Suneet Kamath","And just maybe last one just on the tax rate. Other companies are talking about accelerating investment spending and things like that. It doesn't seem like you're guiding to anything like that in terms of your comments. I just wanted to confirm that.","Dennis Glass","It's interesting. We talk about tax reform but essentially what's happening is that you have lower cost. It happens to be, in this case, from tax reform, the one that we're talking about. As we've discussed, our digital program is expected to lower our costs significantly as well. So we're not focused on any one specific cost reduction program, but ongoing cost reduction both from, again, tax reform as well as other things that we have in mind, and we'll balance the need for further investment.","Right now, the amount of investment that we're putting into digital is our major program announced well before tax reform and there is nothing at this moment that could be \u2013 is of that magnitude from an incremental perspective.","Suneet Kamath","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Thanks. One more just on the group repricing. I mean with the tax reform happening pretty late in the year and a lot of the repricing occurring kind of near the end of the year. Is it fair to say that most of that won't really be going through for 2018 pricing, but it will be more around the conversations kind of at the end of next year?","Dennis Glass","Let\u2019s just talk about short duration liabilities and Group Protection. A lot of the business has guaranteed rates for a couple of years and so those aren\u2019t re-priced. New business of course is a different story. As Randy said, there's an expectation that over time, the tax rate on charter \u2013 the expense reduction due to tax reform on shorter duration liabilities will in part be put into the product.","Now I think that's great. The consumers got a much better value proposition and we see benefits to the shareholder through increased sales.","Alex Scott","Got it. One more just on the NAIC's group capital calculation that they're sort of coming up with. It sounds like some of the life captive reinsurance transactions may be aren't are grandfathered the way they are in AG 48. I mean do you see that as any risk at all? Do the rating agencies even sort of care about that ratio or will they care about that ratio?","Randy Freitag","The captives are taken into consideration by the rating agencies. The rating agencies are not guided by the NAIC and what policy changes they will make. With respect to the group calculation that the NAIC is working on, there continues to be a lot of discussion about what is going to be and what it's going to be used for. And so it's a \u2013 it's an evolving situation. I don't expect it's going to be a major issue for the industry.","Alex Scott","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Thank you. If you could talk about your mortality experience maybe in December, headlines are suggesting that the flu season thus far, is one of the worst in decades. And may be anything you could say about what you\u2019ve seen so far this year to date.","Dennis Glass","Well John we are not going to talk about any specifics about what we've seen in 2018. But in terms of the fourth quarter, it was a good quarter for mortality. I think it was very similar to the fourth quarter of 2016. I think it gave us in 2017, a very stereotypical year, which is we had elevated mortality in the first quarter of the year, and we got it back in the third and fourth quarter. And it all led to a 99% ADE for the year, right in line for 2016.","It was almost the same pattern. So we had good mortality throughout the fourth quarter. History would tell us that we'll have elevated mortality in the first quarter. That's what we've seen typically, but in terms of any specifics, I read the same articles that you do, so I think I even know some people who have had the flu but other than that, that\u2019s all we\u2019re going to say. History would tell us a lot of elevated mortality in the first quarter and the reality is that we had really good mortality in the fourth quarter.","John Barnidge","I definitely appreciate that. And then my follow-up is do you feel like you\u2019re seeing a massive influx in demand for across-the-board products or benefits products and maybe particular post tax reform?","Dennis Glass","What kind of products, John?","John Barnidge","Benefits, Group Protection products.","Dennis Glass","Yes, I\u2019ve got a sort of a big view on this, which is, from an individual perspective, individual tax reform change. I think it\u2019s going to take a while for people to understand what it really means. We all know that the effective tax rate across income brackets is going to go down, and so short-term \u2013 or, excuse me, this year, I guess beginning in February people see more cash in their paychecks.","When you get to April, what the effect of the elimination of certain deductions, adds to that or subtracts to that is yet to be same. So we\u2019re paying attention to our financial advisers and what they\u2019re hearing from their customers. But I think the whole individual tax rate is not settled in at this point and consumers are not taking action just yet.","John Barnidge","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just a question on Life Insurance, I think last year on the same call, you talked about the quarterly run rate being $125 million a quarter on average. Obviously, you have some good sales in the quarter \u2013 sorry, in 2017, as spread compression improve. But looking at the growth, the earnings growth is still a lot stronger than the 2% to 4% that you highlighted at the Investor Day.","So how should we think about the, I guess, first of all, what would be the new quarterly run rate as we move into 2018? And then how should we think about the near-term growth process as you talk about being pretty robust in 2018?","Randy Freitag","Humphrey, thanks for the question. I think the last time I talked about this was a little more than a year ago, when we talked about the Life business at $125 million, and I think we improved since then. So we\u2019ve seen growth, as you\u2019ve noted, over the last couple of years in the 4% to 6% range, and we\u2019ve had spread compression, which has taken away some of that, which is netted to 2% to 3% a year. So when your roll 2% to 3% onto that $125 million over a couple of years, I think you get largely in line with what we\u2019d expect, which is somewhere in that $130 million to $135 million range right now.","If you look at the fourth quarter, we made $152 million. We had good mortality. We typically have some seasonally strong results in the fourth quarter. Expenses were a little higher, so we\u2019d end up in that range maybe probably at the upper end of that range. If you look at the full year, we made $536 million, $551 million normalized. As Dennis mentioned, the quarter featured \u2013 the year featured some pretty strong results in the alternative portfolio, Life is the primary beneficiary of that. So once again, I think you would end up in that $130 million, $135 million range, probably towards the upper end of that.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. thank you.","Randy Freitag","Once again, that\u2019s before tax reform. So now you have to look at those tax rates \u2013 ranges that we provided and adjust your models for tax reform.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. And then on Group Protection, specifically related to Liberty Mutual, back in the \u2013 at the Investor Day, you talked about the voluntary benefits participation among your customers is about 38% and you\u2019re targeting to get to 35%. My understanding is the Liberty Mutual block, they don\u2019t really have a lot of voluntary benefits. So as you try to kind of cross-sell to that 10 million individuals, like what do you expect in terms of the voluntary benefits participation could come through in the near term? And ultimately, is the 35% still a good longer term target?","Dennis Glass","Yes, let me respond to that in general. First, may be a little correction on the percentage of employee-paid sales. Today, in Lincoln stand-alone business, it\u2019s 50% and also remind you that we have new products coming out, I think in the next six months or so going on sale next year that are ancillary employee purchase products.","So momentum, existing 50% and more momentum, in terms of Liberty \u2013 I\u2019m going to come back to Liberty for just a moment. Liberty is a high quality organization with really good products across the businesses. We\u2019re so delighted that we are able to purchase the Group business, which the quality of business, the quality of service capabilities is just really very good, quality of people is really very good.","So it\u2019s really \u2013 and as Randy pointed out, very complementary, different markets, it\u2019s a good acquisition. The second thing I would say, specifically in response to your question, is that the penetration on the employee-paid side at Liberty is less than what we see here at Lincoln. And it\u2019s a great opportunity, we think for further revenue development, as we go down the road. But as we\u2019ve said when we discussed the transaction and the pricing of the transaction, we did not include any revenue opportunities.","Humphrey Lee","Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks, good morning. Sorry about that earlier. On the RBC ratio, you had previously guided to 460% after the Liberty deal. Is that still a good number? Does that changed at all from the 15 point DTA impact in the fourth quarter?","Randy Freitag","So using about $600 million of capital off the balance sheet, the impact of that is roughly 30 points. So we ended the year at just a little below 4.90, so I think we\u2019re right in line, almost exactly in line with what we talked about earlier.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then I guess any thoughts at this point in terms of if the RBC denominator has changed by the NAIC, how the rating agencies may react to that? And if you need to rebuild \u2013 you may need to rebuild that over time or just reset to a lower number?","Randy Freitag","Yes, look, I think that tax reform didn\u2019t happen that long ago. So I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still formulating their thoughts but I\u2019m also equally sure that when they were taking a look at Lincoln as we took the Liberty acquisition to them, and they thought about our ratings and how we were financing the transaction and they ultimately affirmed our ratings. I\u2019m sure they were thinking about all of the things that could be going along the capital levels.","The majority of them have their own capital models already. We have ratings consistent with the capital strength that we show in their models. So our AA ratings already reflect their capital models, which are different from anything the NAIC has. So very comfortable that the rating agencies have thought about this, but I\u2019m sure they have some more thinking to do, as we all do.","Dennis Glass","And I\u2019d just add to that, we were very pleased that Moody\u2019s has in fact sought in their release indicated it as a credit improvement, the addition that what call it.","Randy Freitag","Credit positive.","Dennis Glass","Credit positive. And listed many of the same reasons for that statement, as we saw as we were exploring the opportunity.","Ryan Krueger","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Perfect. Thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, we will take your question on our Investor Relations line at (800) 237-2920 or through e-mail at investorrelations@lfg.com. Thank you all and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"12785":["Lincoln National Corp.

[Operator Instructions]","Now I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Amanda. Good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's First Quarter Earnings Call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to the most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After the prepared remarks, we will move forward to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As I noted in my closing comments on our year end conference call, we entered 2017 with a lot of positive momentum. Looking at first quarter results, this was clearly evident as we reported record operating earnings and EPS, aided by positive onetime tax adjustments; book value per share increased double digits; and our ROE exceeded 12%, excluding the noted tax items. These were high quality results as all four of our businesses delivered significant year over year earnings growth. Looking forward, I'm confident our franchise and actions can drive both near and long term growth.","In the near term, we are well positioned to drive organic growth through our multichannel distribution model, where we benefit from industry leading shelf space and our broad set of customer solutions. Notably, first quarter sales growth was strong in most of our businesses, including sequential growth in annuity sales for the first time in nearly two years. Disciplined expense management remains a core strength. And with revenues up 5% over the prior year quarter, we should continue to have positive operating leverage.","Account values continued to grow, driving earnings tailwinds to our capital market sensitive businesses. The first quarter is also typically our lowest earnings quarter for the mortality and morbidity businesses. As a result, we are set up well for subsequent quarters. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong, and statutory capital is at an all time high. This, coupled with consistent capital generation, will enable capital deployment to remain robust.","Longer term, I also see significant opportunities. Demographic trends and individuals shouldering more responsibility for their financial security make our financial protection product solutions and retail-centric model more relevant and more valuable than ever. Last quarter, we announced our digital initiative, which is targeted at improving our customer experience. As we noted, we also expect significant cost savings over time as well as potential revenue enhancements.","While interest rates remain low, we have continuously re-priced our products to reflect this environment, and we have no further new businesses, new business pricing changes scheduled. However, at some point, interest rates will increase. Although we are already seeing spread compression abate, higher rates would accelerate this trend, but just as important, will provide more flexibility in terms of our ability to offer consumers an even better value proposition for our products.","Finally, we have a strategic focus to decrease the percentage of sales from products with long-term guarantees and to increase the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. Both of these strategies are seeing favorable results, which will lead to further diversification in our sources of earnings. So a lot to be excited about, much of which is within our control, and a long runway of opportunities.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double-digit earnings growth for our annuity business while results were further bolstered by onetime tax adjustments. As we all know, annuity sales for Lincoln and the industry have been dampened for a variety of reasons, including confusion in the marketplace around the DOL fiduciary rule. However, even in the current environment, we are regaining sales momentum based on our historical strategy of levering distribution with product actions. Importantly, this strategy is entirely in our control, and we began to see early successes in the first quarter.","Total annuity sales in the quarter were $2 billion, an 11% increase from the fourth quarter, with growth in both fixed and variable annuities. This quarter's progress was driven by product enhancements that have been well received in the marketplace. As a result, throughout the first quarter, we saw monthly sales increases. Looking forward, momentum should continue as leading sales indicators are strong and we will benefit from another product introduction scheduled for the second quarter.","Let me briefly touch on some specific product stories from the quarter. We saw VA sales without living benefits increase sequentially and 26% from the prior year quarter. Guaranteed VA sales saw monthly increases as we added products with more investment choice and flexibility while we further penetrated the nonqualified market, where we have a competitive advantage with i4LIFE.","Lastly, fixed annuity sales increased 37% sequentially as higher interest rates are helping our consumer-friendly, shorter surrender charge, indexed annuities sell well in the bank and financial adviser channels. It's also worth noting that in addition to higher volumes, new business returns also improved sequentially. As we noted on last quarter's call, we are also broadening our product portfolio to capture trends towards fee-based compensation and passive investments. Near term, adoption will likely be slow, though we believe both have significant long-term growth opportunities, so strong quarter for the annuity business. We are very encouraged by our sales momentum, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate the evolving marketplace and further build sales. In retirement plan services, we are pleased to see double-digit increases over the prior year quarter in earnings, deposits and net flows as our strategy and franchise continues to drive positive results.","Deposits in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 26% from a year ago. First year sales more than doubled to $800 million as we delivered strong results in both our small and mid to large markets, aided by continued success from recent product launches, combined with increased wholesaler productivity. Recurring deposits increased 4% to a record $1.5 billion as the combination of our high-touch model and our new digital functionality, like click to contribute, encourages participants to save more in their retirement plans.","For the quarter, net flows totaled $116 million, up nearly 50% from last year's first quarter. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of positive net flows. During the quarter, we did have one large relationship terminate, though our higher sales levels were sufficient to overcome this termination. Looking forward, we expect this year's net flows to exceed 2016. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for our RPS business, and our strategy positions us well to drive future earnings.","Turning to Life Insurance, earnings improved significantly from the prior year as variable investment income recovered and mortality was favorable relative to the prior year and typical seasonality. Our sales were also excellent. Total individual life insurance sales in the quarter were $158 million, a 20% increase from the prior year quarter. In aggregate, expected new business returns for the quarter were at the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%, reflecting a series of pricing changes over the past several quarters.","We continue to benefit from our broad product portfolio and our tilt towards products without long-term guarantees. As examples, our term sales increased 8% compared to the prior year quarter while our UL sales declined 6%, driven by pricing actions we took on GUL late last year. Our VUL sales increased 24% as sales in last year's first quarter were negatively impacted by market volatility.","MoneyGuard sales followed a record 2016 with further growth in the first quarter as we are benefiting from our multichannel distribution approach and continued demand for linked benefit products, as highlighted by industry sales growth of nearly 20% in 2016. Given our leadership position in linked benefit products and reduced market availability of long term care funding solutions, we believe we have some additional pricing power. As a result, we recently adjusted prices, which will improve returns.","Lastly, we continue to remain opportunistic with respect to Executive Benefit sales, which contributed $23 million to total life sales. So our life business got off to a great start this year. Looking forward, our sales pipeline remains strong. And given our product breadth and the strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our ability to further grow the business.","Turning to Group Protection. In what is typically our lowest earnings quarter due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings grew over the prior year period as amortization expenses declined and loss ratios remained favorable. I have noted in recent quarters that premium growth will be important as we look to drive the next leg of margin improvement. Therefore, I am pleased that premiums grew over the prior year period for the first time since 2014, and we expect annual premium growth this year driven by improving persistency and sales growth.","In the first quarter, we continued to experience improving persistency trends. Total block persistency rates increased over 5 percentage points from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved renewal persistency, which reached the top end of our 70% to 75% targeted range and disability coverage's.","While sales decreased 3% from the same period last year, I would note the first quarter represents the smallest contribution to full year sales, and we have a strong pipeline heading into the second quarter. Importantly, our pricing remains disciplined, and our outlook for sales growth over the remainder of the year is aligned with our long-term target of mid single digit increases.","So in summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals and look forward to moving past this typical first quarter DAC amortization. We expect to benefit from further premium growth, favorable loss ratios and, therefore, stronger earnings over the remainder of the year.","Shifting to investment results. After an $8 million loss in the prior quarter, alternative investments had an outstanding quarter as both our private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to our 15% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $3 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.2%, 50 basis points higher than in the fourth quarter, as we benefited from higher treasury rates and asset mix. Notably, our fixed income portfolio yield was unchanged compared to yearend at 4.79%.","Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high quality and broadly diversified. Below investment grade assets represent less than 5% of our fixed income portfolio, down 60 basis points sequentially due to maturities and prepayments.","So in closing, I am pleased with the start to our year, which includes record operating earnings and solid sales trends. As I look forward, I remain confident that our key strategic objectives, manufacture primarily retail products, target the fastest-growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management, utilize digital to drive a differentiated customer experience and increase efficiencies and actively direct capital to the highest and best uses, will drive long-term sustainable growth. More importantly, our simple, clear and straightforward business model has a track record of financial success and earnings stability, and we see clear near- and long-term opportunities to drive further shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $442 million or $1.92 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.26 per share in the prior year. As we noted in the earnings release, the current quarter benefited $0.19 from onetime tax adjustments. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 37% year-over-year as all 4 of our businesses delivered double-digit growth.","Beyond items that caused typical variability quarter-to-quarter, I would note a couple items that impacted the current quarter. First, within other operations, the adoption of stock compensation accounting guidance will now cause some variability in our taxes, with the biggest impact likely occurring in the first quarter of each year tied to vesting schedules. In the current quarter, this increased earnings by $9 million. Next, within our group business, earnings were reduced by $13 million as DAC amortization was higher than our typical quarterly run rate.","Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 5% in the quarter, driven by a 9% increase in average account values and strong sales results over the past year from our mortality and morbidity businesses. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 10% to $58.37, an all-time high. Reported operating ROE was 13.6%. When adjusting for notable items, ROE was 12.2%, 20 basis points above our annual ROE in 2016. Finally, our balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $266 million to shareholders in the quarter. Net income results for the quarter largely mirrored operating earnings as both credit performance and hedge program results were excellent.","Now we will turn to segment results. Starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $281 million. Excluding the benefit of onetime tax adjustments, earnings totaled $240 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Operating revenues increased 2% even with 1 less fee day in the current quarter and the prior year benefiting from more fixed income annuity deposits. Excluding notable items, return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and our ROA was 75 basis points, up 1 basis point versus the prior year.","Our strategy of consistency and selling in our terms has produced differentiated results and a high-quality book of business. One way to highlight this is looking at net amount at risk, which sits at less than 0.8% of account value for both our living and death benefits, truly outstanding risk results on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. So a solid quarter for the annuity business, and with end-of-period account values 1% above the quarterly average, we entered the second quarter with a tailwind.","In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $37 million, up from $31 million in the prior year. Excluding $2 million from tax adjustments in the current quarter, the earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income from higher account values and expense management. Positive net flows of $603 million over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets, resulted in a 12% increase in average account values while end-of-period account values reached a record $61 billion. G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 1%, trailing revenue growth of 6%. As a result, the RPS expense ratio decreased approximately 100 basis points.","Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 16 basis points versus the prior year quarter, slightly above our expectations for spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points. Looking forward, we expect to be at the low end of that range. For the quarter, our ROA was 24 basis points, excluding notable items, consistent with recent quarters. So a good start to the year for our retirement business, highlighted by double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and assets, all of which led to excellent earnings and positions the retirement business for continued momentum.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of $130 million increased substantially from $75 million in the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to a recovery in variable investment income, combined with favorable mortality relative to the prior year quarter and typical seasonality. While these two items always comes with variability, I would estimate that relative to our assumptions, each added about $5 million to this quarter's earnings. Earnings drivers remained solid for the quarter, with average account balances and Life Insurance in-force both up 5%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, primarily due to the recovery in variable investment income.","Shifting to spreads, base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 7 basis points year-over-year, within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed. Similar to RPS, we would expect to be at the low end of that range in 2017. So a great quarter as variable investment income recovered and we experienced more favorable mortality relative to last year's first quarter. Our outlook for earnings, driver growth and seasonality remain consistent with comments I made last year, all of which support long term earnings growth for our life business.","Group Protection earned $7 million compared to $5 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $13 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate for amortization.","Our nonmedical loss ratio of 71% continues to be strong, but was up 140 basis points compared to very favorable results in the prior year. Recall, last year, I noted that our loss ratio had 1 to 2 points of favorable variability, primarily from our disability block. Therefore, similar to last year, loss ratios were solid across all of our businesses. As Dennis noted, we are encouraged by year over year increase in premiums, we expect this to advance our margins in 2017 and for future premium growth to further improve our margins.","Let me discuss our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. First, in capital, we are extremely well positioned as our statutory surplus stands at $8.9 billion. We estimate our RBC ratio ended the quarter at nearly 500%, up nicely from our yearend RBC of 489%. Our capital and liquidity profile is further bolstered by $551 million of cash to the holding company.","This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And when combined with our shareholder dividend, we deployed 60% of our operating earnings, above our long term target of 50% to 55% but consistent with our guidance for 2017. We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and a track record of getting that cash back to shareholders. This remains an important priority. To this point, we implemented a 10b5 1 trading program, enabling us to better spread our repurchases over the course of a quarter. Through yesterday, we have repurchased $76 million in the quarter.","So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported record operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our weakest. Earnings quality was high as all four of our businesses delivered double digit growth, and net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Sales were particularly strong in the life and retirement businesses, and we are seeing sales momentum in our annuity business. Operating revenue grew 5%. Book value per share increased 10%. Our ROE, excluding notable items, was strong at 12.2%. And finally, capital generation and deployment remain important parts of our shareholder value creation.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Amanda, can we please begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Erik Bass of Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","In the life business, you're seeing solid growth in the in-force, and it looks like you're gaining share. And in addition, I think you mentioned that new business returns were at the high end of your range. I was just hoping you could talk more about your competitive position within the market and what's driving the growth?","Dennis Glass","Let me talk about the market, competitive position in general first. I think it's a fairly solid market. I don't see, we don't see any people reaching for business through pricing actions. And certainly, we're not reaching for business through pricing actions. I mentioned that our sales growth came from, for example, variable universal life, which was up 24% over the first quarter. That has to do with VUL sales being a little depressed in the first quarter of last year because of the volatility in the equity markets and people not wanting to pull the trigger on products that were equity-based. We also mentioned MoneyGuard. We're just a leader in that business. Equity-linked products are growing at 20%. We're a leader, we're growing a little bit faster than that. So it stems from having good growth in a couple products this quarter over prior quarter, but more importantly, on a long-term basis, having a pretty broad portfolio so as consumer preferences change, we can offer another solution. And I would use VUL as an example of that in the first quarter last year. It wasn't a strong preference for the reason I mentioned, but this year, it is. So I come back to distribution strength, shelf space and broad product solutions as the answer to your question.","Erik Bass","Okay. And you've talked in the past about potential interests in group benefits M&A, so just hoping you could discuss how you would think about a larger deal that could materially shift your business mix and how much capital capacity you would have for potential M&A, including any potential debt capacity.","Dennis Glass","Yes. As I mentioned in my remarks, we have a strategy of increasing the percentage of our earnings that come from our mortality and morbidity businesses. This quarter, that percentage was about 25%. Over time, we'd like to see it grow to 30%, 33%. So we've made some progress on that objective organically principally because of the recovery in the group business and, again, this quarter, good results in the life business. So when I think about M&A, broadly speaking, and we've discussed this publicly a number of times, probably our first choice would be the group business, which would help with that target source of earnings from morbidity and mortality. And again, I'm going to turn over the second half of that question to Randy. We are going to be very disciplined about any transaction we do. We're not reaching for any transactions by paying a high price. As we say, I've said and I said again this morning, we're very careful about the return on the capital that we deploy. So if we do go after a transaction, we will be disciplined about it, as we have been in the past. Randy, you want to add?","Randy Freitag","Yes. Erik, in terms of capacity, as I've mentioned in the past, on the context of an acquisition, I believe, inside of our nearly 9 billion of statutory capital, we have roughly 500 million to 750 million of capacity inside there, once you get in the context of an acquisition. I also think, in the context of an acquisition, on the leverage front, there's some capacity that we would have. Once again, an acquisition that delivers cash flow to the holding company, opens up some capacity, I think probably in the 300 million to 500 million range. Separate from that, we obviously have been and will continue to generate a significant amount of free cash flow, and we've deployed well over $1 billion last couple of years into share buybacks. It represented nearly 900 million for the last couple years. Obviously, we did 200 million this quarter. So I'd point to those items when you think about potential capacity.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Dennis, I was just hoping you could provide some additional color on the initial reaction to your -- some of your new VA product rollouts that occurred during the first quarter. As well as I think you mentioned an additional product that was going to come out in the second quarter. I guess more color on what that would be.","Dennis Glass","Yes. Ryan, the -- we've made a series of product moves that have been well received, some of them this quarter; some of them, over the past couple of quarters. Let me focus on the increase in sales of our non-guaranteed VA business, which is up pretty substantially. What we're seeing on that product -- and again, this comes back to having a lot of products available in the market and changing consumer preferences. We added a death benefit to Investor Advantage, which, again, is a nonliving benefit product, and people just seem to be wanting to lock in some of their equity gains. The benefit -- that benefit provides for sort of a mortality option for them, and so we've seen sales there increase.","When I look at our adjustments on the guaranteed business, guaranteed lifetime benefits, we've made some modest increases in the benefits, maybe 25 basis points on the payout of one of our core products. But we have been able to, because of rising interest rates, increase the investment flexibility. Our value proposition for our financial adviser is to let them have as much flexibility as we can provide to choose good outcomes for their customers. And so as we provided more financial flexibility, that has helped with sales.","When -- the product for introduction in the second quarter is in the category of guaranteed lifetime income. And we're just offering another solution in the marketplace that has a slightly higher guaranteed payout, but there are slightly lower guarantees in it overall. It's a product that has been successfully sold by our competitors. And again, we think, for a segment of the market, it is potentially going to be popular. So again, I come back to distribution, broad -- product breadth, trying to find additional segments of the market that would add incrementally to our sales, not subtract from sales that we're already making.","Ryan Krueger","Great. And then a related question. Lincoln saw some improvement in the quarter on annuity sales sequentially, but most of your competitors continued to see fairly meaningful declines in VA sales. I guess, do you think we're getting closer to the point where industry VA sales are bottoming?","Dennis Glass","I think so. If you go back to the fiduciary rule, let me make two comments. One, how can guaranteed lifetime income not be in the best interest of consumers? With the lack of defined benefit plans, more shouldering of financial responsibility on individual consumers, that has got to be a compelling long term value proposition, so I think it will remain a good product in the marketplace. The DOL is creating confusion, more than anything else, and so you're seeing some of our distribution partners not coming forward with their specific plans because they are waiting to see what the final rule is really going to be.","So I think the whole market, candidly, both qualified and nonqualified business, is being affected by the uncertainty created by this rule and the distribution partners waiting for certainty so they can formalize what their practices and policies are going to be. So I'm hopeful that we'll get to that certainty sooner rather than later, and I think that will help annuity sales overall.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tom Gallagher of Evercore ISI.","Tom Gallagher","Dennis, just a follow up on DOL fiduciary rule. From, I guess, what's out there right now, it sounds like, following the delay, it may -- there's speculation it may go into effect without any major modifications, including private right of action. If that, in fact, -- curious on your perspective how you think that's going to play out. And if that does remain, does that become kind of a game changer as you think about the impact of that regulation and legal liability risk, etcetera?","Dennis Glass","I don't see it as a positive to have to play the part of being the enforcement arm on a product. But as we are doing in our own broker dealer, I think there's enough room inside of that -- inside of the current fiduciary rule to establish practices that meet and exceed the intent of the rule and still provide for the sale of products that are subject to the right of action. So I think that the market will adjust to it. And I come back to, at least in our business, guaranteed lifetime income tromps, whether it's a commission or a fee, and I think it will tromp the BIC, the right of action over time. Personally, and we're public about this, we think that part of the rule should be replaced. I think you've seen less action on this from the DOL, well, I should say I think I know there's less action from the DOL because the Trump administration has not yet gotten their Department of Labor person approved. And I think when that happens, there's a possibility, I'm not saying anything for certain, but there's a possibility that the regulation may have another look by the administration.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then just on, I guess a question on individual life mortality. We now had, following, we'll call it, some rocky quarters going back a couple of years ago, you've had a string of maybe 4 or 5 good favorable mortality quarters in a row. That is pretty different than what the industry experience has been. Any thoughts on why your mortality experience has been favorable on a fairly consistent basis here? And anything with your mix, or I know you had that recapture of the reinsurance transactions. I don't know if that's been trending favorable. But any color as to why your experience has been different?","Randy Freitag","Tom, this is Randy. I can't speak to the industry. I think we've always felt and have proven over time that we are excellent assessors of mortality risk. I think we have one of the finest underwriting departments in the land, and those folks are very good at assessing mortality risk and pricing that risk appropriately, and I think you've seen that in our results over time. As we have retained more business, you're getting a little more variability around our results, and you've seen that. But I think, over time, the quality of our ability to assess mortality risk is coming through our results. In terms of the industry, look, I think that the entire industry is pretty good at understanding mortality. And I think, over time, mortality is going to do what it's always done, which is improve gradually over time. I fully expect that my children will have a longer expectation of life than I have, for instance, and I expect that their children will have a longer expectation of life than they do. So that's mortality over time. That's what we expect, and I think you'll see that in our results and in the industry's results.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then just finally, Randy, I just wanted to make sure I had the numbers right. When you were asked about potential funding sources for M&A, you had said excess capital in the regulated entities of $600 million to $800 million. And debt, I missed what you said on debt capacity, and then you have another $800 million to $1 billion of annual cash flow. Those would be the 3 pieces.","Randy Freitag","To be clear, in the regulated entities, so this is in the context of M&A, I said $500 million to $750 million, so roughly in line with your numbers. In the context of leverage capacity, once again, this is in the context of doing acquisition with the proceeds, I would estimate $300 million to $500 million.","And then just factually, we have bought back shares over the last couple years at a rate of about $900 million a year. We did a couple hundred million dollars in the first quarter, so we obviously have been generating and would expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Seth Weiss of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Seth Weiss","Just a couple modeling housekeeping questions. First, Randy, the $9 million tax benefit in other operations in the quarter, should we expect that to reverse in the subsequent three quarters? And is that seasonality something that we could model out for '18 and beyond?","Randy Freitag","Sure, Seth. Well, I think it's a difficult item to model. The -- it reflects the difference in performance really in equity from the assumptions that go into the granting of equity compensation to employees. So it is, I think, an inherently difficult item to model. I would say that you should expect some seasonality in the number and that the first quarter should be, I would imagine, the quarter when you would see the most impact. And that's because -- there were two elements of what drives this number.","One, you have stock option exercises, which would have a skew into the first quarter because that's when you cross an anniversary, and that is oftentimes a trigger for some sort of event. And separately, the first quarters would be when all of the performance shares that we grant and the restricted stock that we grant vest, and that would be the event that drives part of the results. So I think you should see a seasonality in that -- in it in the first quarter, but you should see some level each and every quarter. I think the $9 million number we experienced this quarter would be at the very high end of what I would expect in a typical quarter.","Seth Weiss","Okay. And then one more modeling one and just semantics I want to clarify. Your expectations to be at the low end of the range for RPS and Life Insurance and the spread compression, I just want to clarify. That means the beneficial end of the range. Is that correct?","Randy Freitag","Yes, the beneficial range. On the case of RPS, that would be the low end of 10 to 15, so closer to 10 than 15 and in the case of life, closer to 5 than 10.","Seth Weiss","Great, just wanted to clarify that you are dealing with negative numbers there. Appreciate it.","Randy Freitag","No problem.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of John Nadel of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Randy, I guess the question is, if I adjust for the onetime tax benefit -- and I get that DRD was a big component of that. If I adjust for that, the quarter's underlying effective tax rate on a consolidated basis was just shy of 20%. And the annuities segment was, I think, under 15%, maybe even closer to 14%. In both of those cases, that's below the levels we've seen in the last several years, if not even a little bit longer than that. How do we think about the sustainability of that underlying sort of sub-20 on a consolidated basis and low to mid-teens for the annuities segment as we look forward?","Randy Freitag","Sure, John. I think the difference is in the annuities segment itself. So inside of the annuity results, we talked about we had $41 million of what I would call normalizing items, which brought the result down to about $240 million, which is right in line with our expectations for the business. If you were to factor in equity market growth, the negative net flows, the fact that international markets underperformed the S&P, when you factor all those things, $240 million is right in line with our expectations.","Inside of that result, you would have had some other pluses and minuses. One of the pluses would have been the fact that every year, in the first quarter, we have a normal truing up of our DRD as we get actual information in from the funds. That had a positive impact on the annuity business of roughly $8 million. Now that positive $8 million was -- that's a recurring item, by the way. That's going to occur on a regular basis. You never know how big it will be, but this year, it happened to be a little bit -- about $8 million. That was offset by the fact that the first quarter of this year had 1 less fee day than last year and also the fact that we had some noise in our commissions this quarter, really a swing between fourth and first quarter, which negatively impacted the quarter probably by $4 million to $5 million. So when you factor that in, that additional just normal DRD true up that we experienced in the first quarter, if you would add that in also, and life had a couple million of this impact also, you would see that the normalized tax rate, if you want to add them back, would be in the 22% range, which I think would be in line with our expectations, all else being equal, for what that number would be as you move forward.","John Nadel","Okay. But you -- but I think you also just mentioned that the DRD -- that $8 million benefit would be ongoing. Is the first quarter reflective of the full year benefit of that? I imagine it's not.","Randy Freitag","Yes. I didn't mean to say it would be ongoing. What I mean to say by that is this is a normal process . Every year, we get the actual information from funds, and we have to true up our estimates that we put up at the end of the year. This -- in the case of 2017, that happened to be about an $8 million positive for the annuity business.","John Nadel","Got it. That's very helpful. And then just another question on sales, and I'm thinking about the fixed annuity sales. And I know it's not that big of a line, but I'm wondering what the composition looks like in that $560 million or so of sales this year versus the $668 million last year. How much of a contributor is the indexed product?","Dennis Glass","The indexed product without lifetime guarantees is about $315 million of the total fixed annuity of $516 million -- $562 million. Fixed annuities with lifetime income is about $135 million. So it's all about $100 million of the $562 million.","John Nadel","And how did -- if I think about the sales growth or decline in the indexed portion of the product, it -- what are you seeing there? Is that also being impacted by DOL sort of overhang?","Dennis Glass","Okay. So let me -- the fixed indexed annuities are up 37% versus the prior quarter, most of that coming out of just normal accumulation fixed indexed annuities. And so the -- and the higher amount is due to the fact that interest rates are a little better in the quarter versus the prior year. And that product competes with CDs, and so we had slightly better advantage. And I'd also say -- and I keep underscoring distribution strength. We've been building our shelf space over the last couple of years in the bank channel for fixed annuities and in the adviser channel for fixed annuities, so we're seeing some effect from just better distribution coverage.","John Nadel","And would you characterize that product line, particularly the indexed annuity product line, as pretty competitive, Dennis? I asked because American Equity said earlier this morning that price competition there is pretty significant. It's not just the Bermuda-backed NIMs. Obviously, now there's some real brands competing in the indexed annuity product area, including your own as well as a few others that, that wasn't, that clearly was not the case just a few years ago and prior?","Dennis Glass","Yes. First of all, the firm that you've mentioned is not really in the market that we're in. They're a lower investment grade, their products are higher commission, longer surrender periods, less liquidity. So we continue to price rationally. And again, our improvements, I think in large part, are related to a specific attempt to reshape products over the last couple of years for that bank and financial adviser channel. And again, that means shorter surrender charges, more liquidity for the consumer. And that's a good place for us to be, and I just, I don't think it's affected by the company that you mentioned. And let me, I was asked a question earlier about the DOL. Actually, the new head of the DOL has been approved just in the last couple of days. What I meant to say, he hasn't had much time to look at things.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Just a question regarding the VA net flows. So for the past year or so, you've been kind of pressured by outflows related to the products that comes with the volatility controlled funds. So if I were to look at the net flows in this quarter, was the voluntary controlled funds VA continued to be a pressure? And if so, how much of those funds account for the net outflows in the quarter?","Dennis Glass","Yes. I guess, I'm going to jump to a little higher level on that question, and that is that our outflows have ranged from 7% to 10% over the past 3 or 4 years. The 8% or 9% that we saw in the first quarter is a little higher, but sort of within the range of what we see over time. Whenever equity markets rise dramatically, there might be a little bit of a consumer reaction to surrendering. But let me come back to the higher point. There's nothing in this first quarter that is dramatically different. As a matter of fact, it's in the midpoint, mid-range of what we've seen over the last several years.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then looking at, maybe a modeling question, but looking at corporate, or sorry, other operations. So if we adjust for the $9 million of tax benefits, the $22 million still looks relatively favorable in the quarter. Was there anything kind of timing related that is kind of taking place in the quarter?","Randy Freitag","Humphrey, it's Randy. I think it's fairly typical. If you think about other operations, you add back that 9 million, you're right, you get to negative 22 million. If you think about next quarter, we're going to lose a substantial portion, I believe two third, of the amortization of the [indiscernible] and the reinsurance, so that will negatively impact that particular segment. I would say there's a little bit of seasonality in other operation's expenses. Branding is oftentimes a little lower in the first quarter and a little higher in the second quarter. But all in, that segment has been running in that negative 25 to negative 30 range, so I don't think we're really materially different from that this quarter once you adjust for the stock-based compensation.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Suneet Kamath of Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","So a question for Dennis. On prior calls, you've kind of given us your sense of sort of bid-ask in terms of M&A opportunities in the market. Obviously, without us commenting on any specific deal, any update there in terms of what you're seeing?","Dennis Glass","I think there's a couple of rumors about certain companies divesting a noncore businesses. But again, in Randy's and my experience, which goes back decades, it seems to be a pretty low volume of transactions at least that we would have any interested in -- interest in. So I would just say it's at the low end of the range from our experience, the activity. And it doesn't mean that we couldn't pick up or it doesn't mean that we wouldn't do something, just answering your question. There's not much that we're seeing that fits what we're interested in.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then, I guess, with tax reform back on the table again, we've been getting some questions about the impact of potential estate tax repeal on the life insurers. Can you help us frame maybe how important that -- or how big a piece of your Life Insurance business that would represent and if the state tax were dramatically reduced or eliminated, what you'd expect in terms of your in-force business?","Dennis Glass","Yes. The amount of our -- you mean in-force or sales?","Suneet Kamath","It'd be helpful if you give us both actually.","Dennis Glass","Yes. We'll have to get back to you on in-force. But the amount of new sales that we have is sort of 10% to 12% from what we could observe as being specifically related to estate tax planning. But let me come back to the whole issue. I'm not sure that the change as it's presented, which is the removal of estate taxes but a tax step-up in basis at the transfer of the asset, won't actually give the industry a bigger opportunity for tax. That would be income tax planning. But right now -- I'll just use a simple example. Right now, if you have a $10 million estate and you're husband and wife, you could pass that on estate tax-free, and there's no step-up on basis that you're taxed on. If that estate tax goes away and you have a $9 million step up in your $10 million estate, now all of a sudden, where you didn't have an estate tax, you now have a $9 million -- you have the tax on $9 billion -- $9 million of step up. So I don't -- it's not as simple as the estate tax goes away from an industry perspective.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then maybe just one last one, if I could sneak it in. Just on the -- I think somebody asked you about this before, but just a follow up on the ETF based VA. Any comments in terms of the progress there? But then, more importantly, have you seen other competitors launch sort of similar products following the announcement of your BlackRock related product?","Dennis Glass","As I mentioned in my comments, we've adjusted our products to capture these trends, which we think are going to grow in importance over time, the two trends being a little more fee based compensation than commission based compensation and a little more focus on passively managed funds than actively managed funds. Specifically, with respect to our product that we've talked about, it requires a lot of interfacing technology with the broker dealers that will put it on the shelf. We've had four or five successes so far with getting it on the shelf and having the technology work, but nothing significant in terms of sales. And we wouldn't expect any real significant sales sort of to pop up overnight, but to grow over time. But we do think, over time, it will grow to be a valuable product.","Suneet Kamath","Any competitors following suit?","Dennis Glass","Not that we're aware of, but it would seem like something that would -- we think it's a good idea.","Operator","And this does conclude today's Q&A session. The company will follow up with those with remaining questions later this afternoon. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, we will take your questions on our Investor Relations line at 800-237-2920 or through e-mail at investorrelations@lfg.com.

Please go ahead, sir.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's first quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.","These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including adjusted income from operations and adjusted return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Following record financial results last year, we start 2018 by reporting record first-quarter adjusted operating earnings per share. Organic growth drivers in capital management over the previous 12 months contributed to high quality results, as pre-tax earnings increased 6% and shares outstanding decreased 3%. When combined with the benefits from tax reform, EPS excluding notable items increased 14%.","This quarter's strong earnings were broad-based and highlight profitable growth actions and the power of our retail franchise, which brings together a comprehensive and expanding product portfolio with distribution breadth. Notably, every business generated revenue growth, and our Life Insurance group and RPS segments all reported double-digit increases in after-tax operating earnings. Excluding notable items, Annuities also reported double-digit growth. Other key shareholder metrics were also solid with book value per share up 18% and ROE of 13%.","As we announced Tuesday, we completed the acquisition of Liberty's Group Benefits business. We are excited about the increased potential for our Group business, and I will speak to this shortly.","Our balance sheet remains strong and we ended the quarter with statutory capital at an all-time high. We have said, and it remains the case, that we will resume share repurchases no later than the third quarter. We temporarily paused buybacks, as you know, to help fund a portion of the Liberty acquisition.","Industry RBC ratios may be affected by tax reform, C1 factors, and possibly the VA reserve and capital review. We are aware of the range of these outcomes relative to Lincoln, and the final outcomes are not expected to affect our capital adequacy and announced capital management plans. More importantly, capital adequacy starts with management's view of what capital cushion is necessary for stress situations, and we are comfortable, as I have just said.","Rating agency requirements are important, and their views may change over time for any number of reasons. However, we just had all of our ratings affirmed when we announced Liberty, which occurred after tax reform was implemented. Its credit ratings were also done understanding our capital programs. Bottom line, we do not see the need to delay or reduce buybacks.","Turning to interest rates, higher rates are helping new business returns and enabling us to take some product actions to improve our competitive position and drive profitable growth. We also expect that with rates at current levels, the 2% to 3% annual headwind to EPS growth from spread compression will abate sooner than we indicated at our last Investor Day.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. An 8% increase in average account values resulted in double digit earnings growth, again excluding one-time favorable tax adjustments in the prior year quarter. Total annuity sales were strong in the first quarter, up 25% to more than $2.5 billion as our strategy of expanding the product portfolio and leveraging distribution strength is gaining traction. I would note that 20% of sales in the quarter are from new products.","Let me briefly touch on some other specific product results from the quarter. Variable annuity sales increased 40% compared to the prior-year quarter. The quarter sales strength was broad based with all distribution channels up more than 20%, both qualified and non-qualified markets increasing more than 30%, and double digit growth in nearly every product category. We also generated sales growth in variable annuities with and without living benefits. Fixed annuity sales did decrease 12%, primarily due to a decline in SPIA sales and slower sales in the bank channel. Importantly, sales have bounced back recently as we are expanding shelf space and adding new distribution partners.","In addition to stronger sales, new business returns also improved sequentially, a combination that will reward shareholders. I remain confident in our ability to further increase sales and return to positive flows. Our sales growth continued in April, and the improved regulatory environment is also a modest helper. Adding to this momentum are management actions, including the launch of an index variable annuity in the second quarter. This is a new product category for Lincoln. However, it is a $9-billion market, growing quickly, and market share is highly concentrated. We see an opportunity to participate in this growth and take more market share. Other key drivers include a couple of new and meaningful distribution opportunities later this year. These are the type of things we're doing that are making a difference and why I am confident sales will accelerate.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings increased 16% over the prior year quarter, driven by consistent growth in deposits, net flows and assets as our strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results. Deposits in the quarter of $2.4 billion were up 5% from a year ago. First-year sales of $800 million matched last year's very strong results. Recurring deposits increased 7% to a record $1.6 billion. Contributing to these gains is our high-touch model and digital functionality, which are leading to higher employee contribution rates and increases in participation.","For the quarter, net flows totaled $463 million, more than 3 times last year's first quarter. This marks our 9th consecutive quarter of positive net flows. Bottom line, we remain confident in growth opportunities for the RPS business. Recent results highlight the strength of our business model, which is positioned to effectively compete in our target markets, again, driving top and bottom line growth.","Turning to Life Insurance, earnings increased 11% from the prior year. Individual life sales were $163 million, with strong growth in VUL, resulting in total sales increasing 3%. MoneyGuard sales also remained solid following a record 2017. In aggregate, expected new business recurrence for the quarter were well above our target levels.","As we noted last quarter, a more favorable macro backdrop is allowing us to improve our competitive position in UL and IUL. As a result, we expect these product enhancements will help with sales diversification and growth in core life products, while still enabling us to achieve targeted returns.","The Life business got off to a great start this year and our outlook remains strong. We expect growth to continue, driven by further product diversification and our position as a market leader, combined with the depth and breadth of distribution.","Turning to Group Protection, in what is typically our lowest earnings quarter due to higher seasonal DAC amortization, earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios remained favorable. Premiums increased 3%, driven by improving persistency and last year's strong sales growth.","In the first quarter, total block persistency rates increased 3 percentage points, with improvements across all product lines and nearly all case sizes. Sales decreased 4% from the same period last year. I would note that the first quarter represents the smallest contribution to full year sales and we are encouraged by a solid level of quote activity.","Importantly, industry pricing remains disciplined. We have not seen any disruption from our announced acquisition of Liberty and we expect sales trends to be decidedly positive. The Liberty acquisition immediately increases our scale, further broadens the customer base and distribution channels, and expands capabilities. Liberty's Group Benefits financial performance in the first quarter was consistent with our expectations, setting us up well to deliver on planned financial targets.","In summary, we are pleased with the positive business fundamentals. Looking forward, we expect Lincoln's existing business to generate solid premium growth. And when we combine it with Liberty's block, premiums will increase substantially. The incremental earnings from Liberty should grow over the course of the year as expense synergies take hold.","Shifting to investment results, we invested new money at an average yield of 4.1% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than the fourth quarter as we benefited from higher treasury rates. Our fixed income portfolio yield decreased 2 basis points, consistent with expectations. As I noted earlier, with interest rates at current levels, spread compression will abate more quickly.","The alternatives investment portfolio had a solid quarter, with both private equity and hedge funds contributing to an 11% pre-tax annualized return, and we grew the portfolio to more than $1.5 billion. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape, high-quality, and broadly diversified, with investment-grade assets representing nearly 96% of our fixed income portfolio.","In closing, I am pleased with the start to the year, which includes, as I mentioned, record earnings per share. We have a lot of positive momentum in the underlying earnings drivers. Notably, annuity sales growth continues to be robust and we expect sales accelerate over the course of the year, driven by further product introductions and meaningful distribution expansion. RPS net flows have consistently been positive for more than two years and are helping counteract spread compression.","In Life Insurance, new business returns are strong and upcoming product enhancements will further help sales diversification and profitable growth. Group premiums and margins are benefiting from management actions, while the Liberty acquisition and the favorable economic backdrop serves as tailwinds.","Bottom line, I'm confident that our key strategic objectives and initiatives will enable our track record of financial success to continue. And I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported adjusted income from operations of $441 million or $1.97 per share for the first quarter compared to $1.92 per share in the prior year. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 14% year-over-year, as nearly every business delivered double-digit earnings growth.","Touching on performance of key financial metrics in the quarter. Adjusted operating return on equity was strong at 13%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, grew 8%. Positive consolidated net flows and equity market strength led to a 10% increase in average account values. When combined with solid sales results over the past year, operating revenues were up in all four businesses. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as G&A expenses increased 3% even as we make significant strategic investments. G&A expenses decreased 11% sequentially, largely reflecting seasonality.","Finally, our balance sheet and capital position continued to be strong with an estimated RBC ratio of 510%. Net income totaled $367 million in the quarter. The hedge program performed exceptionally well with $20 million of net losses during a period of heightened market volatility. A couple other items worth noting: an early tender for some debt resulted in a $19 million loss, while credit losses remain benign.","Now, I will turn to segment results, starting with Annuities. Earnings for the quarter were $267 million, compared to $240 million, excluding favorable one-time tax adjustments in the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from an 8% increase in average account values due to equity market strength of the past year more than offsetting negative net flows. Return metrics remain strong, with ROA at 77 basis points and an ROE of 22%.","The current quarter did include some anomalies that reduced earnings by approximately $10 million. It is also worth noting that the first quarter has the fewest number of days to collect fee income, and we would expect the additional day of fees to help offset the impact from lower end of period account values. Our strategy of consistency in selling at our terms, paired with industry leading risk management, has produced differentiated results and a high quality book of business. Net amount at risk sits at less than six-tenths of 1% of account value, well below most peers. And our hedge program continues to deliver exceptional performance, as I noted in my opening remarks.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $43 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income and the benefits of tax reform, partially offset by lower spread income. Positive net flows of $1.8 billion over the trailing 12 months, combined with favorable equity markets drove average account values to $68 billion, up 15%.","Revenue increased 4%, while G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized increased just 1%. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed six basis points versus the prior year quarter, while ROA was 25 basis points. So, a good start to the year for the Retirement business, highlighted by robust net flows and asset growth, which helped drive a double digit increase in earnings.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $144 million increased from $130 million in the prior year quarter. Primarily attributable to in-force growth and the benefits of tax reform. Partially offset by lower variable investment income. Mortality was slightly favorable relative to typical seasonality. Earnings drivers remain solid for the quarter, with average account balances up 7%, and Life Insurance in-force up 4%. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 11 basis points from the prior year quarter, and we expect full year results to be within the 5 to 10 basis point range we have discussed.","So, a great start to the year for the Life business. We are particularly encouraged, because the first quarter is typically our weakest earnings quarter due to seasonally high mortality.","Group Protection reported $29 million in earnings compared to $7 million in the prior year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. As a reminder, with the first quarter representing our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period, but decreases in subsequent quarters. This reduced earnings by $11 million when compared to a typical quarterly run rate.","Overall, business momentum remains solid, which resulted in an after-tax margin of 5.7%. The non-medical loss ratio was 64.3% in the quarter, a 670-basis point improvement from the prior year. Better loss experienced in long-term disability from lower incidence and a lower average claim size in Group, Life were the primary drivers.","Premium growth is also aiding the Group business, as premiums increased 3% from the prior year quarter, with leading indicators such as quote activity and persistency trending in a positive direction. While there can always be volatility quarter to quarter, our claims management and pricing discipline, combined with the current economic environment, particularly related to labor trends, should support solid bottom line results.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus stands at $9.4 billion, and our RBC ratio ended the quarter at 510%, up nicely from year end RBC of 489%. Holding company cash exceeded $1 billion and will remain above our $450-million target after down-streaming $500 million for Liberty acquisition financing.","As you are aware, the NAIC has recently been reviewing impacts to required capital related to tax reform and investments or C1 risk factors. Most of the proposals are still preliminary, but we are aware of the potential range of outcomes and are extremely comfortable with our capital position, and will deploy capital consistent with our free cash flow guidance.","We have dealt with regulatory uncertainty in the past and it is important to know, Lincoln takes leading roles on important industry issues, which this is one. This has helped us accurately assess regulatory outcomes and impacts time and time again. Bottom line, our capital position is robust, and as Dennis noted, is focused on stress testing and maintaining our ratings. The rating agencies reaffirmed our financial strength ratings post the Liberty announcement, and we plan to be back in the market repurchasing our shares no later than the third quarter. In total, we expect to allocate more than $2 billion towards buybacks, dividends, and M&A this year.","So wrapping things up, an excellent quarter for Lincoln. We reported strong operating EPS in a quarter that is historically one of our lowest. Looking forward, seasonal improvements in mortality, lower group DAC amortization, and more fee days leave us well positioned. Underwriting results in Group Protection and Life Insurance were solid, while Annuities and RPS benefited from account value growth.","Earnings quality was high, with pre-tax earnings up 6%, and after tax earnings further aided by tax reform. Key shareholder metrics were solid as book value per share increased 8% while ROE came in at 13%. And finally, we look forward to successfully integrating Liberty's Group Benefits business and reinstating our buyback program to further create shareholder value.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question and answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, and then re-queue with additional questions. Crystal, please open up the Q&A lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question will come from Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. First, I just have a question on the timing of buybacks. You reiterated your previous view that you'd start no later than in 3Q. The stocks folded back significantly recently and given your whole liquidity position, to what extent would you be opportunistic in maybe starting a little bit earlier to take advantage of the lower stock price?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Jimmy, thanks for the question. Let me take your question and broaden it out a little bit, because as you may have been able to tell by both Dennis and my comments, there has been some information, I think, out in the marketplace which I think has both been confusing for investors and at odds with what we've been saying. So I want to dig in a little bit on this whole capital question.","So let me make a few points. First, let's talk about RBC ratios. RBC ratios, as we've said for years now, are reasonable relative measures of strength, but they are not what defines capital adequacy. What defines capital adequacy is the amount of capital you have on your balance sheet, combined with the stresses that a company can face in a stressed environment. Stresses like deep recession scenarios, deep drops in equity markets, very low interest rates, big credit losses. Or stress like you may face in a stagflation environment like very high interest rates, credit losses, lower equity markets. That's what defines capital adequacy.","So let's turn to Lincoln. Over the past seven or eight years, we've been growing our capital. $9.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, $9.2 billion at the end of the year, up from $6 billion or so if you go back six or seven years. So as we've grown, as the risks in our balance sheet have grown, we've grown the amount of capital we have. And along the way, especially over the past three to four years, there's been a consistent message from us, and that is that we have, on our balance sheet, up to $750 million of extra capital to be used in the case of M&A. And that's exactly what we do. So we told you that, and we delivered exactly on that with the Liberty acquisition, where we put $600 million of capital to work.","Let's talk about the other items that are going on. First let's talk about C1 work that's going on. We're obviously very involved with that. It's very important to us that the factors that the NAIC ends up both make sense and that there's consistency across asset classes. But let's be clear about C1 factors. It doesn't matter if they go up, down, or sideways. The credit losses that we experience in a stressed environment do not change one single dollar.","Let's talk about the second item, the change in factors after tax reform. It's a logical change. During a stress scenario, we are going to experience higher after-tax losses, just like we're going to experience higher after-tax gains in a normal environment. When we gave you the most recent guidance that we had up to $750 million, we did that in full sight of these lower tax rates.","The stress scenarios we ran, they included the lower offset from the lower tax rate. When the rating agencies affirmed our ratings, they did it in full sight of the lower tax rates. So, yeah, let me once again affirm our capital plan and the fact that we will be in the market no later than the third quarter.","Now to your question. We have owned Liberty \u2013 we're the proud owners of Liberty for all of two days now. We've had information, but now we actually own it. And I agree with you, our stock is tremendously undervalued right now and we are going to do everything we can to fully understand Liberty and try to get into the market as early as possible. No later than third quarter, but believe me, we are going to do everything we can to try to get in as early as possible. Thanks for the question, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And just one more, in terms of competitive trends in your major markets, have you seen any evidence of competitors sort of reducing prices in response to the lower tax rates in any of the key markets that you compete in?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think it's really too early, Jimmy, to make definitive statements about your question. The specific answer to your question is we haven't seen any effect in pricing, to our knowledge, related to the reduced tax rates.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is open.","Please check that your line is not on mute.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Can you hear me?","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","We can, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I had a question about...","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","We lost you again, Ryan.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Sorry.","Operator","Pardon me, sir. Please make sure your line is not on mute.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Sorry, Crystal, can we go to the next question, and then queue Ryan back in?","Operator","Yes, sir. And our next question will come from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about your distribution partners. Obviously, there's been a lot of change just in the recent period here with the DOL rule being vacated and then the SEC rolling out their version \u2013 at least preliminary version of a standard. How are your distribution partners kind of feeling about the current regulatory environment? Is there a portion of the channel that's still sort of wait and see, or are we kind of back to full distribution of your product?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think everybody is sort of cautious right now. As we know, the Fifth Circuit sort of vacated the DOL's fiduciary rule just yesterday. They didn't permit an appeal. Now, that may go to the Supreme Court. So that's \u2013 people are still watching the legal side of this.","Importantly, in general, the SEC, who we always thought should lead this and that the DOL and the state should harmonize with the SEC's best interest standard, has come forward. And their standard has many of the provisions that we thought were important. So, for example, investor choice as to products and no bias towards fees or commissions as a form of compensation. So that's all very good.","And most importantly, and sort of back to your question, to the extent that distribution partners started differentiating between qualified and non-qualified products, had to do primarily with this enforcement by the plaintiff's bar that was contained in the DOL fiduciary rule. That does not show up at all in the SEC rule. And in fact, happily, enforcements turned over to FINRA.","So I think we're seeing very positive signs at a better regulatory best interest rule. And the removal of the plaintiff's bar from the enforcement side of it, I think will \u2013 again, on many of our partners that \u2013 not discriminated, but differentiated between qualified and non-qualified plans, I think that will go away. So we're very encouraged. We're very encouraged with the SEC proposal, and we think over time that'll be good for the industry and good for the customers.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just on your new indexed VA product. Is there \u2013 can you just talk a little bit about how you expect to roll that out over the coming quarters? And then, is there anything unique about what you are offering versus what is currently available in the market in terms of that specific product?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, we'll begin rolling it out in June and we'll be allocating a portion of our wholesaling force to the product, focusing on that product. There are some advantages to our product versus the competition, and we expect that to both help us take market share and expand the size of the market with our presence and wholesaling capability.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And does that change your outlook for flows? I know over the past couple of quarters, we've talked about a return to VA flows at some point, but has your outlook there changed at all?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","As I said in my opening remarks, we think the sales momentum is encouraging with respect to reaching positive net flows. This product could be a potential significant help to that. Also, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're adding additional shelf space later in the year and significant shelf space. That will also help. And then, you just have a better overall market for all of the products, as you've seen with the increases in each of the product categories.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger, KBW. Your line's open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Can you hear me this time?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","We can.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Sorry about that. I had a question on Liberty Group Benefits. You mentioned that it was consistent with your expectations in the first quarter. Just hoping you could provide some additional detail maybe on the progress they're making when it comes to margins after repricing.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, as we said, I mean, the results that we have seen have been very consistent. We've been very excited and pleased by the high quality of work that we've seen from the Liberty team in starting the whole process of repricing the book. And point out that we went through this, and you're seeing the powerful results that can come from repricing the book, and they can come pretty quick.","I think when you layer in that little bit of repricing work that still needs to be done with the $100 million expense synergies that we've talked about, you can understand why we're so excited about this opportunity. And, very excited that our margins will be right where we would expect them to be in not too long.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","And early on, I think we said that a third of the benefits from the cost savings is attributable to overhead allocations that go away in part when you move a company into Lincoln. And so that sort of is early benefit for the results that we expect in 2018.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then just one quick one. Can you comment on what your new money rate was in the quarter?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think it was 4.10.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next one question comes from Randy Binner from B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to actually pick up where Suneet left off on a couple of details around annuity sales. I guess on adding shelf space in the bank channel, Dennis, what exactly does that mean? Is that expanded distribution relationships in geographies? Is it a new product on the index side? I'd be interested to hear how you're adding space there.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","The specific comment about adding additional shelf space relates to adding new banks where we haven't been before. In banks where we are expanding the product offerings, some incremental increase in the number of wholesalers in the bank channel. So all of these things.","We also have another exciting distribution expansion discussion going on, which we think will come to fruition, which actually is an entirely different distribution channel than we've been in before for our products. And that could be meaningful if it gets done. And we're hopeful it is.","So as you've seen us over the last couple of \u2013 actually for quite some time, years and years and years, it's this ability to pivot with distribution and with product as markets change, as consumer preferences change, as capital markets change. We continue to do that across our product lines. And that strength of product and strength of distribution and the flexibility is what helps drive our top line and bottom line results.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Is that new distribution channel you're talking about, would that be an e-commerce solution?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","No, it would not.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","Okay, and then, so I guess more to come there. And then just back on SEC, do you have any sense of timing on the preliminary rule coming out, and when we might get more details on how that could be implemented?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","It's a pretty complex rule, and people are \u2013 and there's a comment period that has started. So I think it will take a few months or more. But we don't know the exact answer to your question.","Randy Binner - B. Riley FBR, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I have a clarifying question. So I think, Randy, in your prepared remarks you talked about you are committed to deploy $2 billion this year for buyback, acquisitions and dividends. I guess in terms of the M&A piece, are you including the $425 million of required capital that you would inject into the business, or just referring to the purchase price piece of $1 billion?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Let's be clear, Humphrey. I think I said at least $2 billion.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","So that includes about $1.45 billion from the acquisition, and we're on track to pay-out $280 million to $290 million of dividend this year. And when you include buybacks, we will be at least $2 billion.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. And then in terms of \u2013 I guess you talked about the Liberty Mutual's Group Benefit consistent with your expectation. I guess between now and when you announced the transaction, any changes to your current expectation in terms of how the cost synergies and the earnings would emerge over time?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","No. I think the planning is going great. The team is very excited. We closed the acquisition on Tuesday morning. But I think the actual plans are coming in pretty much how we thought they would come in.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I will just repeat a couple of things to add on to what Randy said. One, as I mentioned in my remarks, the first quarter results from Liberty were consistent with our expectations, so that's a positive. The planning for the integration, I think has been exceptional. And so I'm quite comfortable that we were prepared yesterday, which we've been referring to as day one, to move forward all of our plans, both the integration plans as well as the other things that were talked about, which are benefits from the combination of the new transactions. So we're very excited about realizing the outcomes that we've shared with you in terms of integration savings and the other benefits from the acquisition.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","I guess what I'm trying to get at is in terms \u2013 I think at the time of the announcement, you talked about the after-tax margin would be 3% at closing based on the pre-tax reform. Is that still the case that based on what you looked at the Liberty Mutual's book in the first quarter, or are we potentially could be looking at a little bit better performance?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Humphrey, I don't remember getting that specific to say 3%. But let's think about where we are. So Lincoln today is \u2013 we just posted 5.7% in the first quarter. Liberty, last year, posted about 1%. If you just average those two numbers, you get a little over 3%. It'd be 3.5% to be specific. The Liberty book is improving with the pricing actions that have been taken. As Dennis mentioned, a third of these expense savings which are corporate overhead start to roll in pretty quickly.","So once again I think if you go back to the one page from the deck we went over when we announced the acquisition, I think we get back into that 5%, 7% range on margins pretty quick. And once again, we expect this transaction to be accretive in 2019. So yeah. Humphrey, everything is going as planned. We're super excited. Every Lincoln employee and every Liberty employee that are now \u2013 all now part of the Lincoln family are ready to go.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Obviously over the past couple of months, long-term care has been in the news and you don't have exposure, but it hasn't really affected your stock performance in a beneficial way. I'm wondering what the industry is thinking and whether you can comment on if there were a Penn Treaty type liquidation of a long-term care carrier, how it would affect Lincoln?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Josh, I don't think there's a specific answer to that question. We as a participant in the state guarantee fund pools have been participating in liquidation resolutions for a long, long time. I think specifically the Penn Treaty one, we accrued what that was going to cost us, Josh, four or five years ago.","My recollection is \u2013 I know some companies did it last year, but we did that a number of years ago. And if there are any liquidations going forward, we'll contribute our appropriate share, and I wouldn't expect anything that would appear to have one single impact on what we may or may not do from a capital standpoint or anything like that.","So Josh, we'll participate. We're part of this great industry. Don't expect liquidations or bankruptcies, but they do occur from time to time, and in this great industry, the industry steps up and participates in helping out the impacted policyholders. And we'll do that again.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And on an unrelated topic, with the launch of buffered annuities, are there inducements to convince the agents to give you some scale on this? Is there any initial sort of sales inducements or whatnot coming on as you launch the product?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","No.","Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is open.","\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nTom, this is Randy. Thanks for the question. I think that comparing MoneyGuard to traditional LTC is like comparing apples and oranges, or apples and tangerines, or any other two things you can think of that are very, very different.\nSo, let's talk about MoneyGuard and the differentiators that we see in that product. The first one I'd point out is just product design. MoneyGuard is a limited benefit product, where a policyholder can get typically up to about six years of benefit. And inside of that benefit, the first two years or so are going to come from their own funds.\nThe second thing I'd point out about MoneyGuard is the risk profile of a linked benefit product, a product with multiple benefits. In the case of MoneyGuard, that's with an LTC \u2013 a limited LTC benefit and mortality benefit. Now, those two benefits work together to create a very stable risk profile, so that product returns are impacted only modestly by increases in either mortality or morbidity incidents. I think that's another key differentiator.\nThe other thing I'd point out about MoneyGuard is the pricing environment that that product was priced in. So, the pricing for MoneyGuard, especially over the last 5 to 10 years, when we sold the bulk of our book, benefited from having significantly more experienced data at its disposal. It really allowed us to develop a set of assumptions around lapsation, morbidity incidents, those sorts of things that really reflected all of the bad experience that the traditional LTC players are having to reflect in their models today.\nThe other thing I'd point out is, additionally, the bulk of MoneyGuard was priced in a low rate environment. The environment that's existed over the past decade. And lastly, Tom, I would just point out that our experience on this book, whether it's mortality, morbidity incidence, whether it's lapsation, has been very consistent with the expectations that we had when we priced the product.\nSo, no. I don't see these products as being similar at all. MoneyGuard is part of an overall financial planning process that allows a policyholder to fill part of a need, multiple needs that they may have. It's a great product, and it's why you have seen sales of this sort of product grow dramatically. It's why you're seeing other entrants come into the space.\n\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nI think I have got a standard response when we third quarter, but no, I'm not worried about this product. As I said, everything is running right in line with our expectations\n\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nNo, Tom. Just a few things I'd point out on annuity spreads. First, I mentioned in my script that there was roughly $10 million or so of negative items that impacted the quarter and they were spread all around the income statement. But some of those were in both investment income and interest credit. So, I think that had a modest impact.\nI think the other thing that you see in that business is that credited rate actions aren't perfectly aligned with declines in the portfolio yield, but they do catch up. As a reminder, over 60% of that book of business has room to move credit rates on. So, you may not get perfect alignment quarter-to-quarter, but we have a lot of room on that book.\nAnd the third item I'd point out, and it's a much smaller impact on a particular quarter, but when you think about book trend, the business we sell today goes on at a lower spread. And the business we sell today, $130 million, something like that from a expected spread standpoint. So over time, you would expect to see some trend in that direction. So, I don't see anything other than what you see, which is the spread came down, but there were a number of reasons for that that make the change quite understandable.\n\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nYou bet.\nOperator\nThank you. And our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel from Janney. Your line is open.\nRobert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nGood morning. And following up on Tom's question. Just how many of your MoneyGuard customers have the long-term care rider? And we're probably too early to see whether there's been any people that have activated that feature, but any further details on that would be appreciated.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nWell, Bob, everybody who has a MoneyGuard product has that rider. That's what the product is.\nRobert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nRight. Understood.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nMoneyGuard is a joint benefit product. We've been in the business for about 20 years, so we do have some experience on older business. But I'd say the majority of our \u2013 the bulk of our business, as I mentioned, has been sold over the last decade. Experience, as I said, is coming in right in line with our expectations. We really did benefit from having full view of a fair amount of experience in the industry that existed when we were pricing.\nSo, let me reiterate, Bob. Experience is coming in right as we'd expect. We're very, very comfortable with that product. It is a great product. It's why that product has grown, not just at Lincoln but across the industry. And as I mentioned, it's why you see a number of companies moving this way because it is a tremendous way to fill a need in a overall financial plan with acceptable risks and quality returns.\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nAnd, Bob, just to put a fine point on your question. The utilization of the benefits is exactly \u2013 well, not exactly, but it's very consistent with what we priced for. So there's no concern on that specific point at this time.\nRobert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nI would think very few have utilized it. So, I understand you're comfortable, and it certainly makes sense that you are and it's good that the experience is as you thought.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nOnce again, Bob, and let me reiterate sort of the way those benefits work together. Obviously, if you pass away, you don't use your LTC benefit. But if you do engage your LTC benefit, you're using up your death benefit. So, once again, these benefits work together, creating this very stable risk profile.\nRobert Glasspiegel - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC\nThank you, Randy, Dennis.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nThanks Bob.\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nThanks, Bob.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nHey, good morning. Just question about M&A. You seem very pleased about the Liberty acquisition. And I know you've said you kind of felt like you'd filled out the company, Dennis, with that deal. But does this kind of encourage you maybe to look at some other Group deals, or maybe Retirement Plan Services deals? And if so, what's the pipeline like?\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nYeah, Andrew, I think that as \u2013 although we haven't done an acquisition for a while, we used to do quite a few acquisitions. And generally, when you do something of this magnitude, the first order of business is to make sure the integration is successful. So with respect to the Group business, I would say 100% of our attention in terms of M&A is on the integration of this business. I'd also say that \u2013 and you may have seen our \u2013 well, you've seen our reports on this. I mean, we are pretty comprehensively covered now in the market; small employers, large employers, asset management, dental, all of the products. So, I don't see a need to non-organically add to that business at this point.\nIn terms of RPS, we're very satisfied with the progress in that business. We see opportunities there down the road to expand it. It fits very well with our overall strategy in the context of our wholesale distribution organization and the ability to sell in the small markets, which has a meaningful impact on the overall top line. So RPS is doing very well. And again, we're not, at this point, anxious to do any additional bolt-on acquisitions until we produce what we said we would with respect to the Group business.\nNow, in the M&A environment, as we all know and have watched over the last couple of decades, things can change. I do think you'll see a little pick-up in M&A overall, but where that happens, I can't be sure of. But we're happy with where we are right now.\nAndrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nGreat. And then just with regard to RPS, you had another excellent quarter with net flows at $463 million. Where are you seeing the strength there? Is it in the K-12 area? Is it in 401(k)? Where is the strength coming from? And can it continue?\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nYeah, it can continue. We're dominant in the education \u2013 not dominant, we have significant market share in the education market, and in the healthcare market, and so that's where we're seeing a lot of the sales come from. But we are broad based, as you just mentioned. We're in the small case 401(k), and larger case 401(k) as well. But our sales are focused on those areas that I've mentioned, and particularly the small market which covers a lot of industries.\nAndrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nSo anything changed? Is that why it's so strong? Or it's just...\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nYeah, I think the management team that we have in place has narrowed the focus of specific marketplaces, and we've added tremendous talent over the last couple of years that's beginning to pay off. So I think it's a combination of talent and focus. And then I'd quickly add, this is a marketplace where digital is sort of a baseline competitive consideration, and that our digital activities that we've talked about, Click-to-Contribute, Click-to-Chat, and services like that, are very competitive and very strong.\nThen also, in the mid to large case market, I think we're the only manufacturer that actually has personalized advice at the work site. That's what we refer to as part of our high touch model.\nOur customers pay for that, or otherwise it's included in our pricing. So in the right markets, with the right value proposition, and inside of Lincoln, taking advantage of, particularly, our distribution strength and size.\nAndrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC\nThanks, Dennis.\nOperator\nThank you. And we will take our last question from John Nadel from UBS. Your line is open.\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nThanks for sneaking me in before we switch gears yet again. But I just have one question. I'm looking at the Life Insurance segment results, and I guess I'm curious. There was a pretty significant increase in the equity allocated to the segment. You jumped from about $6.8 billion to $7.8 billion. And I'm trying to understand why it's such a significant increase. Maybe we just keyed it wrong, but nothing underlying that segment looks like it's growing at that pace. So is there some other driver of why the equity is moving up so fast?\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, please standby. Your conference call will resume momentarily.\n[Technical Difficulty] (01:01:18-01:03:05)\nOperator\nAnd speakers, please proceed.\nDennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.\nWe apologize. We had an issue here with power. Randy, please go. John, are you still on the line?\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nI'm still here. I'm just not sure if you can hear me anymore.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nI can hear you, John...\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nOkay.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\n...and I'll answer your question --\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nI thought it was -I thought I just got far too detailed, and you just decided enough is enough.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nI would say that your question was so compelling that you knocked the power out in Radnor, Pennsylvania.\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nI have that effect all over the world, Randy.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nIf you go back to your-end, we talked about the fact that we had $1.3 billion impact from tax reform, and that roughly $1 billion of it was associated with the Life Insurance business. So, when we did our year-end financials, we wanted to make sure everything was comparable to previous quarters. So we put all of that impact in terms of what we put in the Other Operations segment. And then immediately after so on January 1, we re-classed all of the numbers out to the appropriate segment. So you would have seen the Life Insurance equity in the first quarter go up by that billion dollars associated with tax reform.\nJohn M. Nadel - UBS\nGot it. Thank you.\nRandal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.\nYou bet.\nOperator\nThank you. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Chris Giovanni for any closing remarks.\nChristopher A.

Before I begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday, and on our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to the most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. First quarter results were disappointing as operating earnings fell short of our expectations. Importantly, most items that negatively impacted our earnings appear to be temporary, and we anticipate a nice recovery in the second quarter. Randy will describe this in more detail.","While earnings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong and resilient as we continue to grow book value per share and actively deploy capital. Our franchise also remains a competitive advantage. Product breadth and innovation, coupled with our distribution reach, gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities, while also delivering on our strategic priorities, including shifting our new business mix towards products without long-term guarantees. This quarter, some examples of this included: sales of Life products without guarantees increased 13%. Group sales grew 5%, marking our first year-over-year increase since 2013. RPS deposits of $1.8 billion increased 5%, and nearly 50% of our Annuities sales did not have guaranteed living benefits.","Before turning to business line results, let me provide a high-level view of how the final DOL rule seems to impact Lincoln's business model. In general, as we anticipated, the final rules mostly moved in a constructive direction. On the positive side the rule clearly documents the use of commissions alongside fees as appropriate compensation. Specifically, the DOL agreed in the final rule that commissions can be more cost-effective for investors who do not trade frequently, as would be the case with annuity purchasers. In its discussion of annuities, the DOL also emphasized that the BIC exemption is designed to preserve commissions, allowing investors to choose the payment structure that works best for them. The inclusion of grandfathering addressed the concern of a major disruption related to a backward application of the new rules.","The rule acknowledges the benefit of lifetime income guarantees, which significantly differentiates Annuities from other financial products. The expansion of the education definition leaves our high-touch retirement business value proposition intact.","Somewhat negative, but generally not expected to seriously impact Lincoln, would be the inclusion of indexed annuities in the BIC will take some extra work in the independent channels, where the compliance ecosystem is not as comprehensive as it is for registered products sold through broker dealers. In the first quarter, only 3% of our total Annuities sales are fixed indexed annuities sold through non-registered insurance agents in the qualified space. Adding the group variable annuity to the BIC may have eliminated a competitive advantage under the proposed rule, but we believe it leaves us in a competitively neutral position.","Our distribution partner response so far is generally consistent in the expectation that they will use the BIC for commissions. It also may prove out that distribution partners will need to trim shelf space and focus on fewer higher-quality companies, which I believe would be an advantage to Lincoln over the long term. Our efforts are now turning to working with the DOL, our distribution partners, and internally, to be sure that an effective compliance system is developed to reduce the right of action risk that remains a part of the rule.","Now, turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. A 4% decrease in average account values and lower variable investment income resulted in Annuity earnings declining from the prior year. However, strong recovery in equity markets later in the quarter led to account balances ending the quarter flat with year-end, which positions us well for subsequent periods. Total Annuities sales were $2.4 billion and net outflows were modest at just $35 million. Over the past year, net flows have added $1.3 billion to account balances. As I have noted in the past couple of quarters, market volatility has dampened consumer demand for equity-sensitive products, and there appears to be some regulatory impact as well. Higher persistency has helped net flows.","Although sales are lower than last year, as we said we would, we used some of the capital that was to be allocated towards Annuities sales to buy back stock at attractive levels. So, while we have experienced lower sales recently, longer-term, our consistent approach and commitment to the Annuity business positions us well to grow this high-quality source of earnings as marketplace headwinds subside. Turning to Life Insurance, we recognize there will be a focus on our mortality experience this quarter. While we typically expect higher claims in the first quarter, we also saw an unusual number of early duration claims. In terms of sales, total individual Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $132 million, a 5% decrease from the prior year quarter. Importantly, our focus on selling more products without long-term guarantees continues to gain traction. As I noted upfront, sales of these products increased 13% and represented 71% of our total Life Insurance sales, up from 62% of our sales last year.","Included in this are many exciting product stories. For example, Term sales increased 32% as we continue to benefit from product enhancements made in the third quarter. Indexed Universal Life sales increased 20% as we were helped by our mid-year product launch. Additionally, regulation that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. MoneyGuard sales increased 5%, which is impressive coming off record annual sales in 2015. We continue to remain opportunistic with respect to executive benefit sales, which contributed $7 million to total Life sales. Looking forward, our pipeline remains very strong, and given our product breadth and strength of our distribution, we remain optimistic about our new business opportunities.","Turning to Group Protection, we are pleased with the year-over-year earnings increase driven by the significant improvement in our non-medical loss ratio, which continues to benefit from our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management processes. First quarter sales of $59 million increased 5% from the same period last year, which marked our first year-over-year sales increase since 2013. As our pricing actions have stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced. As a result, we expect improvement in sales activity and growth to persist. As I noted last quarter, this will be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums while sustaining pricing discipline.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings, deposits and net flows were generally consistent with our outlook. First quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were up 5% from a year ago. Recurring deposits increased 6% and benefited from both employee and employer contributions. First-year sales grew by 3%, and notably, our pipeline continues to be very strong, which should benefit sales in the second half of the year.","Our focus on specific markets and our differentiated customer experience is working and helped drive positive net flows for the Retirement business, which marked the fourth time this has occurred in the past five quarters. Over this period, flows had added more than $0.5 billion to RPS account balances. While we continue to anticipate lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows, we expect annual net flows to exceed 2015 levels. Confidence in our growth momentum is driven by our alignment with the fastest growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in the marketplace with a high-touch service model.","Spending a minute on Investment Management, we put new money to work in the first quarter at an average yield of 4%, which was down 30 basis points from the fourth quarter. The decrease in new money rates was due to a drop in treasury rates as we invested at 210 basis points over the average 10-year treasury in both periods. Our alternative investments generated an $8 million loss in the quarter. Headwinds from our hedge fund portfolio, which represents one-third of our alternatives carrying value, and the impact of lower energy prices on our private equity investments were the primary drivers of this result. Over the last four years, our alternatives portfolio, which is now $1.2 billion of assets, has averaged a 10% annual return, a level we expect to achieve over the long run.","Let me also update you on our fixed income energy portfolio where we continue to proactively monitor and manage our credit exposure. Following nearly a $1 billion decrease in energy holdings in 2015, we trimmed almost $500 million in the first quarter and another $250 million in the second quarter. In total, this represents a 17% reduction in energy holdings over this period. Our sales, targeted securities most likely to be at-risk of credit loss in a sustained period of low-energy prices.","In the quarter, we did experience some negative ratings migration from the energy sector. However, the RBC impact was manageable and downgrades have slowed. The increase in oil prices have helped reduce our energy net unrealized loss, which was $375 million at quarter-end, an improvement of $100 million from year-end. Bottom line, we feel very comfortable with our energy exposure and the overall quality of our investment portfolio.","Turning to distribution, the depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to differentiate Lincoln. The strength of our distribution force has enabled a shift in sales mix to the point that now 75% of enterprise sales do not have long-term guarantees, up from 65% a year ago.","While we continue to have success shifting sales to products without long-term guarantees, as I noted in the business sections, sales of our individual products were lower. This reflected the impact of market volatility on consumer demand which keeps money on the sidelines, combined with some impact from regulatory uncertainty.","That said, you have heard me say many times distribution is a competitive advantage for Lincoln and I expect Lincoln to once again differentiate itself as market headwinds subside and distributors adapt to regulatory changes.","In closing, I'm looking beyond the first quarter as I anticipate items that impacted the quarter to abate or reverse, and I expect our earnings to return to levels you have been accustomed to seeing Lincoln produce. Our strong franchise, balance sheet and capital position create a lot of flexibility and opportunity.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $314 million or $1.25 per share for the first quarter, $0.10 below the prior year. As Dennis mentioned, there were several items that negatively impacted our results this quarter. While we do consider these items to be part of normal volatility, at this time we do not expect them to reoccur in the second quarter.","First, group results were negatively impacted by accelerated amortization of DAC, which ran $18 million or $0.07 a share above our typical quarterly run rate. I will provide more detail on this later, but we fully expect amortization to moderate.","Next, alternatives were below our expected results by $25 million, which negatively impacted the quarter by $0.10. While it is too early to comment on our expectations for the second quarter, the recent recovery in the broader equity and energy markets are likely to have a positive impact.","The equity market recovery should also boost our fee-based earnings. First quarter results were impacted by a decline in average account balances though by the end of the quarter account balances were largely unchanged from year-end. As a result, this should add roughly $0.05 to our quarterly run rate.","Lastly, consistent with first quarter results the past few years, we experienced elevated mortality, which negatively impacted individual life earnings by $30 million or $0.12. We estimate that roughly two-thirds of this was the seasonally high mortality that we typically see in the first quarter, and we'll comment more on mortality in the Life section of my comments.","Now, shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased less than 1% in the quarter as another quarter of positive net flows was offset by a decline in equity markets, resulting in a 2% decrease in average account values. G&A net of capitalized expenses decreased slightly and notably trailed revenue growth. Book value per share excluding AOCI grew more than 7% to $53.25, an all-time high.","Finally, our balance sheet remains an important source of strength even with interest rates at or below levels we saw during the first quarter. This gives us significant financial flexibility, which we once again exhibited this quarter with $260 million of capital deployed to shareholders. Net income results for the quarter included an investment-related legal settlement, $27 million of variable annuity net derivative losses and a similar amount of general account investment losses.","Now, we'll turn to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $218 million. A decline in average account values and lower variable investment income, which includes income from alternative investments and prepayments, were drivers of the 9% year-over-year decrease in earnings. Operating revenues declined 2% from the first quarter of 2015 after excluding an increase in fixed income annuity deposits.","Over the trailing 12 months, net flows totaled $1.3 billion. This 1% organic growth rate was more than offset by headwinds from equity markets. Return metrics remain strong as ROE came in at 20%, consistent with our average return over the last decade. ROA decreased 4 basis points versus the prior year and stands at 74 basis points. Given the equity market recovery, we expect Annuity earnings and returns to see a nice boost in subsequent quarters.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $31 million, down from $35 million in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in variable investment income. First quarter revenue decreased 2% year-over-year, consistent with the change in average account balances as positive net flows of $415 million over the 12 trailing months were offset by unfavorable equity markets.","Although average account values declined, end-of-period balances totaled more than $54 billion, in line with the prior quarter and prior year. Spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 3 basis points versus the prior-year quarter, better than our expectation for spreads to decline by 10 basis points to 15 basis points annually in the Retirement business.","Our return on assets was 23 basis points for the first quarter. However, more normal variable investment income would produce an ROA at the low end of the 25 basis point to 30 point basis point range we have discussed in the past.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of $75 million were down as a result of unfavorable mortality and $17 million of lower alternative investment income. This quarter, mortality negatively impacted earnings by $30 million. And again, roughly two-thirds of this reflects typical seasonality.","Included in this quarter's mortality result were an unusual number of early duration claims, which represented approximately $8 million and explains why our mortality experience exceeded normal seasonality. To provide some context, during the first quarter we had claims on 16 large policies that were underwritten within the past two years versus a quarterly average of three policies over the past couple of years.","Turning quickly to the Life earnings drivers, average account values were up 3% with average in-force face amount up 4%, both consistent with recent performance. Normalized spread decreased 11 basis points, just above the top end of our 5 basis point to 10 basis point expectation.","So the first quarter, once again, experienced typical seasonality. However, consistent with prior years, we do expect mortality to improve over the course of the year.","Group Protection earnings of $5 million compared to a loss of $6 million in the prior-year quarter, with both periods impacted by accelerated DAC amortization. Importantly, we saw significant improvement in our non-medical loss ratio, which came in at just under 70%, our best ratio since the fourth quarter of 2009 and an 850 basis point improvement from the prior-year quarter.","This quarter's loss ratio clearly benefited from strong experience across all of our businesses. Notably, life and disability continue to benefit from our pricing actions while the latter saw further improvement in claims management. These positive earnings drivers were offset by a couple negative impacts from lower persistency, owing to our extensive repricing of policy renewals. Notably, non-medical earned premiums declined 9% and we experienced accelerated amortization of DAC.","As I noted upfront, the acceleration of amortization reduced earnings by approximately $18 million when compared to our typical quarterly run rate. As the first quarter is our heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period but decreases in subsequent quarters. In fact, this is exactly what we saw last year as well, which gives us confidence that group's earnings power will continue to improve.","Let me discuss liquidity, our capital position and capital management before we turn to Q&A. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $539 million, above our target of $500 million. Statutory surplus stands at $8.4 billion and we estimate our RBC ratio to be approximately 480%, slightly below year-end despite active capital management and a roughly 10 point negative impact from ratings migration.","Additionally, I would note that we executed on a reinsurance transaction in early April which generated approximately $400 million of capital. This capital provides a buffer for uncertain macro environments while also giving us incremental capital to deploy.","This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares as we took advantage of our strong capital position, the decline in our share price, and capital that was freed up owing to lower Annuity sales.","While I remain very comfortable with our long-term free cash flow outlook of 50% to 55% of operating earnings being available for buybacks and dividends, I do see upside to this number this year given the strength of our capital position.","As we've noted in the past, returning capital to shareholders remains a priority for Lincoln. As a result, we expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for increase in our share repurchase authorization, consistent with past practices.","So wrapping things up, earnings were short of our expectations but we see clear signs that our earnings power will recover in the very near term. As Dennis noted, our strong franchise gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities while the strength of our balance sheet and capital generation capabilities allows us to continue actively deploying capital.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Senior Vice President & Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We'll now move to the Q&A portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, then re-queue if you have additional questions. With that, let me turn it over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, my question is on Life margins. If you look at the margins in the business, they have been weak for, I think, the fifth straight quarter versus our estimate, but we've had a steady decline in earnings in the Life Insurance business. Used to earn around $500 million to $600 million on an annual basis; now is \u2013 last year earned less than $400 million. So, really, just trying to understand what's going on. And is there more to it than just seasonality or is it the Swiss Re block that you recaptured, or something else that might imply that the future earnings power of the business is lower than what you had earned prior to 2015?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Jimmy. This is Randy. Thanks for the question. When I think about the Life business, I tend to think about it over a more extended period of time. If you go back four years or five years ago, I'd agree with you that I would think of this business as roughly $135 million, $140 million a quarter business. So right in that $550 million range. If you think about what's gone on in the business then over the subsequent five years, what I would say is that the combined impact of spread compression, that's a real economic item, and the fact that we have done a significant number of reserve transactions \u2013 reserve financings over the course of the year has pulled roughly $35 million to $40 million out of that number. So, you start at $135 million, you come down that $35 million to $40 million. To that, we have added back, I would estimate, roughly $30 million, $35 million a quarter from the new business that we sold over that point in time. When all is said and done, where that leaves you, what I would say today, is roughly $125 million or in that range a quarter.","So, we're $140 million, we've pulled a significant amount of money out of the business due to the reserve financings, there has been some impact from spread compression, but we've added back a significant amount from new business. So, that's what I'd say today, Jimmy.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And the sort of the block that you captured from Swiss Re, how has that performed, not just this quarter, but also over the past year or so? And have you \u2013 has that been a contributor to weaker results in the last few quarters?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jimmy, the block we brought back through reinsurance has performed exactly like the rest of our business. Over the last five quarters, we've seen a little bit of elevated mortality, and sort of the blocks have mirrored each other. There's been nothing out-sized about either the block we brought back through reinsurance or the non \u2013 or the other business.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of UBS. Your line is open.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Randy, I wanted to follow up on the reinsurance transaction that you just talked about towards the end of your prepared comments. Can you, one, give us a sense of what maybe the earnings impact of that transaction is? And then, two, in terms of that $400 million of capital, was that contemplated in your original 50% to 55% capital return guidance?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, first, on the reinsurance recapture, I'll go back to what we said at the beginning. So, our expectations and our actual experience hasn't changed. We expected it to have a modest impact on the actual earnings of the Life Insurance business. But in total, we expected it to be accretive to EPS through the fact that we were going to deploy a significant amount of capital in share buybacks, which we did. So, overall, net-net, we expected that recapture to be accretive to EPS, and it has been. The second question, Suneet?","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Sorry. Yeah, I was referring to the thing that you just did in April. Not the Swiss Re thing, but the thing that you just talked about at the end of your prepared comment.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We are constantly working on optimizing the balance sheet. What I would say about the $400 million of capital that we generated through a reinsurance transaction, it's related to our New York book of business. If you remember, it was about four years ago, the industry entered into an agreement with the NAIC on reserving for secondary guarantee. Well, at that time, 49 states signed on to that. New York, unfortunately, decided to go a different way and didn't adopt the agreed-upon approach. That created a significant amount of non-economic reserves. If you remember, for us, we have been putting up $90 million of additional reserves a year over a five-year period, we're in the fourth year of that, for a total of $450 million of additional reserves. When that happened, we set about \u2013 immediately, trying to figure out a way and figured there would be a way to manage in a more effective way, those additional reserves we were reporting up. You're working in New York, so you have to be a little more restrictive in terms of what you can do. For instance, a captive related transaction is going to be much more difficult.","So, it took a little more time, but we were eventually able to enter into a more traditional reinsurance transaction, and that's what generated the $400 million of relief I talked about. We said that we were going to get that done. Exactly when the timing was going to be, Jimmy (sic) [Suneet] (33:08), was uncertain, but we did complete it here early in the second quarter.","In terms of how does it impact \u2013 or did it impact my expectations, I'd just go back to what I said in the script. Over the long term, we expect 50% to 55% is well within our wheelhouse. But then this year, given the strong capital position, given the fact that we continue to generate strong amounts of capital, continue \u2013 given the fact that Annuities sales are down a little bit, given the fact we did this reinsurance transaction, we fully expect to exceed that long-term guidance this year.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right, got it. And then just the second one on the DOL, Dennis. I mean, you talked about conversations with your distribution partners, but is your sense that these partners would be comfortable that there's enough safe harbors within that BIC exemption that they would still be willing to write business on commission?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Suneet, I think I'd go back to my opening remarks and reiterate that the rule not only allows commissions, but suggests that in certain transactions, commissions may be a better outcome for the consumer than annual fees. So, I think everybody is trying to move forward within the guidelines of the rules. There's certainly some difficulties associated with the right of action. But as I've said, our partners preliminarily appear to be gathering around the idea of creating the compliance requirements to continue to sell products on a commission basis. Again, I go back to my specific comments. The DOL is saying that one may not be better than the other, compensation versus \u2013 upfront compensation versus fees, depending on the facts and circumstance of the product to sell and the ongoing advice cycle.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","And just lastly, how long do you think this transition is going to be? Clearly, there's a lot moving along \u2013 moving around here, but just \u2013 I mean, is this sort of a two-year transition as people kind of get accustomed to the new rules?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The implementation is when the \u2013 within \u2013 window, I believe, is on the next \u2013 is January of 2018. So we know for sure that everything has to be done by then. But I suspect most companies are doing what Lincoln is doing, which is we have large numbers of people moving forward with specific time, tasks, and responsibility plans to comply with the regulations as they exist today. One example of that would be in our broker dealer, where we very much intend to pay commissions on variable annuities, and we're building the right compliance infrastructure to make sure that we're not taking risk on unnecessarily.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Dennis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Erik Bass of Citigroup. Your line is open, Erik.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could provide some more details around group persistency this year around year-end versus what it was in the first quarter of 2015, and maybe what you would think of as sort of a more normal level when you weren't going through repricing initiatives.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure, Erik. This is Randy. If you look at the period of time over which we've been going through this repricing process, you've definitely seen persistency, year-after-year, decline. You go back a few years ago, persistency ran in the range of 80%. As you came into 2014, persistency ran in the mid-70s%. The sort of the cumulative impact of the pricing actions started to really bite, we moved into the mid-60s% in 2015. And that was similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of last year also. And then this year, in the first quarter, Erik, we came in at 57%. Now, so we're down about 8 points from where we were last year. I think as you look forward, we would expect that persistency to start to grow back. Where it ends up over the long term, I expect sort of those mid-70s% as a sort of consistent with the industry experience in this business.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, Dennis, just had one question on DOL, where I think you commented that sales of indexed annuities through independent agents would prove more challenging. But it seemed like you were implying that you think those sales would still be feasible. I guess this is a little bit different from what we're hearing from some competitors who worry that the insurance company would have to be the signer of the BIC since independent agents aren't qualified financial institutions. So I'd just be interested in your perspective on that.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Specifically, what I said is that we only had 3% of our sales of fixed indexed annuities into qualified plans. And I think I then went on to say that the independent distribution channel where you're selling products, non-registered products, is a \u2013 what's the expression? \u2013 is going to be a long bore through a hard board for companies to get to where they need to be from a compliance perspective. I would also say that I think there's a couple of sentences in the DOL rule that maybe could be \u2013 or interpretations that could be tweaked to lessen that challenge. But if you let me be absolutely clear, it's a much harder road on fixed indexed annuities through non-registered distribution.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Kovac of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Michael.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. One for Dennis, coming back to the Department of Labor here. Just when you think about the variable Annuities sales were obviously down fairly significantly, and part of it's driven by the market, some of it likely driven by pending rules. And with the final rules out, have you seen any change in trends in April? Trying to segregate what you guys are seeing internally as to what's leading to the lower sales.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's pretty hard. I keep saying there's a hint of the DOL in the reduced sales. But in fact, the reduction in sales was not that much different between qualified and non-qualified plans. So, we think \u2013 what we don't know is how much more qualified sales there would have been without the disturbance of the rules. But just again, mathematically, qualified sales actually decreased a little bit less than non-qualified sales. But again, it's what was the upside opportunity that was missed that I can't put a number on.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, that's helpful and sort of leads to a follow-up on that basis. Do you expect, as you talk to distribution and think about sort of the foreword with the DOL now out, there being some sort of maybe two-tiered regulatory system where qualified versus non-qualified plans are sold differently by your distribution partners? Or do you expect a longer term merging between the two?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a very difficult question to answer. And I would hesitate to speculate. What I do think is that there's greater transparency because of all the technology that's available. There's trends around best interest requirements. So it will be interesting to see how regulation develops. But from my perspective and Lincoln's perspective, we have to continue to do and offer products and compensation that's in the best interest of our clients, and is consistent with regulation. And that's what we'll continue to do.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And if I could sneak one in for Randy here, when you think about it, I think you've guided us to, in the past, a billion \u2013 or a dollar slowdown in VA sales leads to about $0.05 of deployable capital that you could utilize for share repurchases. Can you give us a sense of the timing in terms of when that comes forward? I know you suggested that you may see higher deployment going forward. We didn't necessarily see that come in the first quarter despite the lower VA sales.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Michael, it comes pretty quickly. I mean, you don't make the dollar sales, and so you don't have to put the capital up. So from that regard, it comes immediately. And I think you saw some of that in the first quarter buybacks, where we did $200 million. As I noted, that was an aggregation of a number of issues, including the strength of our capital position but also including the fact that we did see Annuity sales running at a little bit lower level.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks.","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger of KBW. Your line is open, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning. I had a question for Randy on the group loss ratio. It's obviously a very favorable quarter. I think in the prior to \u2013 a few years ago, I think you've always talked about a 71% to 74% target. I guess just wondering, given you've done a lot of the repricing now, what type of expectations you have going forward?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We haven't, Ryan, really updated that at all. I would say, as the proportion of business that is employee-paid becomes a bigger piece of the book, that that has a modestly lower loss ratio. So over time, you would expect that target to trend down a little bit.","When you look at the quarter itself, we came in at 69.6% for the quarter, it's really \u2013 you start to try to split these things to a pretty much finer level than you truly can. But when I look at the actual experience in the quarter, there are three primary items that really drive loss ratios if you're talking about disability insurance; you have incidence rates, you have terminations and you have the average-sized claim that comes on the books. When I look at those three \u2013 three items and how they impacted the quarter, once again, you're starting to split these things pretty fine. But probably about a one to two points better than we would have expected for the quarter. So that 69.6% had a little bit of favorability in it but not too much.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one on the DOL. Do you have any view of potential incremental costs at Lincoln as you deal with the compliance aspects of this?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I guess somebody earlier today mentioned that there's a thousand pages worth of regulation. There will be some manageable cost increase. Over the years, I've seen a lot of \u2013 for example, when SOX was introduced, I've seen a lot of people worried about the increased costs of managing it. I think most companies who are effective in how they implement the requirements of new regulations can do it on economically manageable basis. And certainly, at Lincoln, we think we can implement whatever we need to on a manageable basis.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Randy Binner of FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Hey, thanks. I have a couple more on DOL. I guess to Dennis' comment on the Lincoln Financial Network looking to pay a commission on variable annuities, on a go-forward basis that would be under the BIC. And so, I hear all the comments that the BIC is more workable but I guess the question kind of quantitatively is what do you think commissions would look like in that scenario? My belief would be that they would be a lot lower. So my question is, how much lower commission would commissions be and how do you feel about how that might affect people's motivation to sell those products?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Randy, I'm not certain I agree with the conclusion that the DOL regulations caused the reaction of lowering compensation. Let me come back to the examples that we shared in our comment letters with the DOL and take a look at the difference between an annual advisory fee of, let's say, 1%, which is not even available to the smaller-sized customers, it would be 2% or more. So if you have a 1% annual fee, I think the breakeven point on a full up-front commission on annuities versus that 1% fee is in four years or five years.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so, I mean it \u2013 and again, back to the contract language, what's in the best interest \u2013 based on this product that's being sold, what's in the best interest of the client, and a long-term contract's up-front compensation may very well be the answer as to what the best interest is. Now broadly speaking, I think the financial services industry is moving toward, in total, more pressure on fees, more transparency, but I think that's an independent issue from the Department of Labor.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah, appreciate that. I just \u2013 I guess the thought process we had, and we're not alone in this, is that the right of private action would seek to find issues where the fiduciary interest is not held up and they'll try and build a class and they'll look for data, and they would ostensibly be looking for the higher-commission products first. Is that not \u2013 I guess if you pay normal commission, would that increase your legal risk if you're going to sell VAs under the BIC?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, these questions are hard to answer sort of in a general statement, so let me come back to a very real differentiation in the fixed annuity market. There's a segment of the market that focuses on less liquidity so that surrender charges and commissions are higher. But then, that value proposition comes along with investing longer and presumably paying a higher crediting rate. Now, we don't participate in that market, and so we don't pay \u2013 we have a more liquid, lower commission product, which is appropriate for our distribution channels in what's Lincoln's view on consumer value is.","So, you're going to have to look at each situation like that. And I don't think that you can automatically come to the conclusion that a less-liquid higher-credited rate product with a higher commission is going to automatically be litigated versus the kind of products that we sell.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","All right, thanks for the perspective.","Operator","Our next question is from Humphrey Lee of Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the comments about the $400 million of reinsurance capital relief. Randy, you mentioned that some of it will be for buffer and some of it could be for capital deployment. Can you maybe remind us how do you size the capital buffer that you would like to hold in a current environment, at least for the near term?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Humphrey, yes, I made that exact statement in the script. I would tell you that I would make that statement at any point in time anytime we have an amount of capital come along. I mean we have capital and we're always prepared for any economic uncertainties that would come along.","I mean rest assured, I'll go back to my other comments, that we will be very active in buying our stock back both in the second quarter and for the full year 2016, fully expect, as I said, to go above the 50% to 55% of operating earnings long-term guidance, and part of that will be because of the $400 million of capital that we were able to generate from that transaction.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then in terms of Group Protection, looking at the kind of adjusted number in terms of the after-tax margin, it was a little bit over 4%. Maybe, like you mentioned, the disability (51:35) underwriting was a little bit favorable. But looking longer term, how close are you back to the historical margin that you target for? And then, maybe given where we are right now, do you expect \u2013 would you achieve that kind of longer-term target in a near-term horizon?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that the \u2013 I shouldn't say I think \u2013 what we say is that our long-term margin expectation is 5% to 7%. We had originally thought we'd get to that earlier, maybe the full year 2017. But because we had lower persistency than we expected and we've had declining premium, our expense ratio isn't where it needs to be. So, I think we're looking out to the lower end of that range the latter part of 2017 or even 2018. Now, if sales, which could happen, move along, properly priced and more robust than, say, 4% or 5%, which is sort of the industry average, that could occur sooner.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Thank you for the color.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. Dennis, thank you for the \u2013 I'm sorry, well, to both of you, but Randy in particular, thank you for the detail that you've provided on the adverse mortality in the quarter on Life Insurance, it was very helpful.","Given that, I don't remember the exact numbers but I was struck by the difference between the number of early duration claims that you had in the March quarter versus the quarter to which you were compared. Given that it was so much higher if I took away the right conclusion, tell me if I didn't \u2013 well, tell me if I don't have the right conclusion. But given that it appears to be the case, that there was such a sharp increase in the quarter in the number of early duration claims, people dying so shortly after they purchased the policies, what is the probability at this point that this is a blip rather than a beginning of a trend?","Randal J. Freitag - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Eric, we have, obviously, as we do with any claim that comes in, spend a lot of time analyzing these things, and specifically this quarters because it was an item that impacted the quarterly results. We have spent time looking at each and every one of those claims, Eric, analyze them down to \u2013 gone back to the underwriting that was done. And when you do all that analysis, it truly looks like a blip.","I think you have to remember that we ensure nearly 2 million people. We write on an annual basis 40,000 to 50,000 new policies on any given year and you are going to have a quarter where things like this happen. I mean, the claims were spread across a wide variety of reasons. Whether it was cancer or gunshots, whatever, you just had a wide variety of reasons that got in there, Eric, and truly looks like a blip.","I think with mortality, you always have to go back to what are your longer-term trends when thinking about what your best estimate of what your next quarter is going to be as opposed to what happened in the last three months.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Eric...","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And \u2013 go head, Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...yeah, if I might add...","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sure.","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...in the short term, something different about the people underwriting or your underwriting policies and practices would have to change for there to be something ongoing that's different, and that hasn't happened. So, we're pretty comfortable with the remarks that Randy has been making. It's a different story than is there some bigger trend than, say, for example, older-age mortality, but I don't have anything to add on that point either.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just one quick follow-up before wrapping up, on this concept of grandfathering. Am I right as you interpreted the DOL rule, Dennis, or do you have a different view, that on existing contracts on which the customer is making systematic payments or any ongoing payments, or on existing contracts in which the producer continues to receive trail commissions, that those contracts are not grandfathered because they're covered by the fiduciary rule?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Eric, some of this stuff is arcane, but my understanding is that so long as a change is not made to an existing policy in terms of what that policy has been, the payments and so on and so forth, so long as there's not a change, there's no reason to go back and do anything different. If it's the equivalent of a new sale in the way \u2013 if something changes that is essentially the equivalent of a new sale, that would be a different story.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I just have one question that hasn't been asked yet. Going back to the alternative investment portfolio, we actually just heard from one of your competitors talking about their interest in shrinking their hedge fund ownership within alternative investments. As you're looking at your long-term returns from this business or from this portfolio, are you seeing any, maybe, adjustments that you want to make to the portfolio or any areas that are more concerning or more attractive to you?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As to the broad question of hedge funds versus private equities, our intention is similar. I don't know what the magnitude of the other insurer's change would be, but we expect to move more toward as a percentage of the total private equity than hedge funds. We'll do that over time.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And would you keep the overall size of the portfolio, of the alternative investment portfolio, roughly the same or would it shrink as you move the weightings within the portfolio?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right now, our percentage of alternatives \u2013 the percent of alternatives of the total investment portfolio is about 1.2%, carrying value at $1.1 billion. That compares to the industry averages of closer to 3.2%, 3%. So, we feel as if there's room for us to grow modestly the aggregate size of the alternatives investment portfolio as we shift some of our hedge funds into private equities.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And could you disclose roughly what the size of the hedge fund allocation within alternative is today?","Dennis R. Glass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, we're happy to disclose that. It's about a third of the $1.2 billion. $400 million. And I guess we'd expect that can come down to $250 million over time.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it.

We will be sending out invitations this quarter and hope many of you would join us in person.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone. The positive momentum at the start of the year carried into the second quarter, delivering outstanding results, notably operating earnings per share growth of 19%. Several factors contributed to our results. First, sales remained strong as most of our businesses reported double-digit growth compared to the prior year. We continue to focus on restoring variable annuity sales and saw sequential growth accelerate during the quarter.","Across the enterprise, new business returns are attractive. We are clearly benefiting from our multichannel distribution model, industry leading shelf space and a broad set of customer solutions, which when combined, differentiate us from competitors and support further growth. Next, the quarter's strength was broad based, as all four businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth. Additionally, the percentage of earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses continue to trend higher, which leads to further diversification in our sources of earnings.","Lastly, as we have demonstrated for years, our balance sheet is high quality and the businesses generate significant free cash flow, allowing active capital management. This continued in the second quarter with $265 million returned to our shareholders. Capital deployment will remain an important part of the Lincoln story. Looking beyond the quarter, as you know, we have a couple of initiative in place focused on supporting long term growth and profitability. First, an enterprise-wide digital initiative that will improve the customer experience while providing cost savings as well as the potential for revenue enhancements. Also, we have a rigorous focus on in-force, renewal and new business pricing across all the businesses. Importantly, both are progressing as planned and will support our strong track record of financial success.","Now turning to the business segments, starting with annuities. Earnings were strong as our high quality in-force business was further strengthened by equity market performance. We saw good sales momentum in our variable annuity business as sales grew sequentially for the second straight quarter. Importantly, growth also accelerated, increasing 11% in the second quarter compared to 4% in the first quarter. VA sales without living benefits increased sequentially and year-over-year as the value propositions for tax deferral and legacy planning are resonating with customers. VA sales with guaranteed living benefits also increased sequentially, benefiting from product enhancements made earlier in the year.","Our portfolio of customer solutions once again expanded late in the second quarter with the addition of a new living benefit rider, which offers customers a higher withdrawal rate than most guaranteed income products, but adjusts if the account value is depleted, providing attractive features for both customers and Lincoln. So while in the early stages, sales momentum is growing in our variable annuity business as product portfolio expansion enables us to take market share now while fee-based products, such as core income, will build over time and help support long-term growth.","Shifting to fixed annuities. Sales in the quarter were affected by the decline in interest rates because our approach to product pricing remains disciplined. However, similar to the variable annuity strategies, we are actively looking for ways to expand our customer base and distribution reach. We recently entered into a reinsurance agreement with Athene that will improve our value proposition by leveraging each other's competitive advantages. We expect this transaction to affect sales immediately and grow over time driven by better penetration into the bank and broker\/dealer channels. Furthermore, I see this relationship as another example of Lincoln's distribution franchise and broad product portfolio being in demand.","Before moving into retirement plan services, I want to highlight that Barron's recently published its list of the 50 best annuities and Lincoln was recognized in six categories, more than any other carrier. This speaks to the breadth of our commission and fee-based annuity product offerings and the valuable solutions provided to our customers. When combined with leading distribution capabilities, we are in a strong position in the marketplace and are optimistic that sales momentum will continue.","In retirement plan services, the strategy and franchise continue to drive positive results as this quarter marked a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows and earnings. Total deposits in the quarter of $2 billion were up 19% from a year ago, driven by first year sales increasing 71% to $737 million as both small and mid-large markets delivered strong results while recurring deposits continue to increase. Net flows totaled $395 million compared to $400 million in the prior year quarter. Over the past 12 months, flows have reached nearly $1 billion and have been positive for six straight quarters.","Our momentum is being driven by the following. Sales growth is benefiting from product enhancements that focused on simple and transparent pricing, this combined with a more tenured wholesaling force is increasing productivity. Next, employee contributions are growing, driven by an improved customer experience that combines face-to-face service with digital and data analytics that motivate and empower them to save more for retirement. Lastly, retention remains strong as a result of better aligning and expanding client facing teams along with continuous improvement in our service center. Bottom line, we remained confident in growth opportunities for RPS business and our strategy positions us well to sustain earnings growth.","Turning to life insurance. Earnings increased double digits, helped by solid variable investment income and growth of our in-force business. Total life insurance sales in the quarter of $197 million were strong, up 14% from the prior year, benefiting from a broad product portfolio and industry-leading distribution. MoneyGuard sales were exceptionally strong, driven by our leadership position in the fast growing linked benefit marketplace and a multichannel distribution approach. Sales did accelerate somewhat ahead of pricing adjustments made during the quarter. As a result, MoneyGuard sales in subsequent periods are likely to be more consistent with prior quarters. VUL sales increased 22%, benefiting from a shift away from interest rate sensitive life insurance products, which have seen significant price increases. To this point, GUL sales were down nearly 50% in the quarter and represented just 6% of total life sales.","Lastly on term insurance. Sales were down 7%, though policy count was up 18% as we leverage digital technology to expand distribution and reach a new customer base through TermAccel, which targets a younger demographic. We continue to focus on sales diversification, risk management and disciplined product pricing to achieve appropriate returns on capital. This resulted in expected new business returns being near the top end of our targeted range of 12% to 15%. Given product breadth, strength of distribution and ability to effectively meet the needs of key consumer segments, I'm excited about future growth in the life business.","Turning to group protection. Earnings increased significantly over the prior year period as loss ratios were favorable. After seeing year-over-year premium growth for the first time in nearly three years last quarter, premiums grew 3% in the second quarter. During the quarter, sales increased 24%, driven by growth in all product lines. Year-to-date, sales have increased 12% and block persistency is up about 4 percentage points compared to the prior year. Importantly, our outlook for these key premium growth drivers remain positive as the sales pipeline and quote activity are strong in our target markets and persistency continues to improve in core life and disability products. Bottom line, we are very pleased with this quarter's results and increases our confidence in achieving and sustaining the 5% to 7% margin target. While volatility can be expected quarter-to-quarter, underlying trends are positive and the top line is improving, all of which support solid future earnings growth.","Shifting to investment results. The alternative investment portfolio had a very good quarter, as both private equity and hedge fund investments contributed to a 17% pretax annualized return. In terms of new money, we invested over $2.4 billion in the quarter at an average yield of 4.1%, down a little from the first quarter. Lower treasury rates and tighter spreads were largely offset by the purchases in private placement and commercial mortgage loans that provided a pickup in spread over comparable public fixed income. Overall, the investment portfolio remains very well diversified and a very high quality. The fixed income portfolio yield declined 3 basis points to 4.76% consistent with expectations. It is also worth noting that the spread between our portfolio yield and the new money rates stands at approximately 65 basis points compared to 110 basis points in the prior year quarter, which highlights how spread compression continues to abate.","So in closing, we're very pleased with the quarter, which included strong momentum in both top and bottom line results, combined with effective capital management. We remain confident in the ability to drive earnings growth, leveraging attractive growth opportunities, in-force margin improvement and our strong balance sheet. I remain convinced our simple, clear and straightforward business model is underappreciated, particularly relative to the competition, given our track record of financial success and earning stability. We, therefore, look forward to continuing our solid results and further closing the valuation gap to reward our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $419 million or $1.85 per share for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year. This quarter's results were very strong, highlighted by record normalized EPS. Underlying trends were solid and all four businesses posted earnings growth. It is also worth noting that while variable investment income was $0.08 better than long-term experience, this was largely offset by higher variable expenses, mainly driven by strong sales production and earnings during the quarter.","Now shifting to key performance metrics. Operating revenue increased 7% in the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in average account values and the positive sales trends Dennis noted. Expense discipline continues to be a good story as net G&A expenses, excluding the variable related expenses I just noted, were up less than 1%, providing positive operating leverage. Book value per share excluding AOCI, grew 9% to nearly $60, an all time high. Operating ROE was strong at 12.7%. And year-to-date, normalized ROE is 40 basis points above 2016.","Finally, balance sheet strength and solid capital generation enabled us to return $265 million to shareholders or 63% of operating earnings, consistent with guidance for 2017. Net income of $411 million further highlights the strength of the quarter as both credit experience and hedge program performance were excellent with net income representing 98% of operating earnings consistent with last quarter.","Now I will turn to segment results starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $251 million, up 7% from the prior year quarter. Earnings growth was driven by higher fee income from a 6% increase in average account values as equity market strength over the past year has more than offset negative net flows. Total operating revenue increased 9% as every revenue line showed growth compared to the prior year. Return metrics remained strong as ROE came in at 21% and ROA was 77 basis points, both consistent with recent quarters. Our high quality book of business continues to differentiate us relative to our competitors and is further enhanced by an extremely successful hedge program, which had solid performance with a $9 million gain in the quarter. The quality of the variable annuity book can be seen by looking at net amount at risk, which further improved during the quarter to less than seven-tenths of 1% of account value for both living and death benefits. So great quarter for the annuity business, which positions us well for strong earnings and returns to continue.","In retirement plan services, earnings of $37 million were up 19% from the prior year quarter. The earnings increase is attributable to growth in fee income and variable investment income combined with expense management. Positive net flows of $994 million over the trailing 12-months and favorable equity markets resulted in a 12% increase in average account values, while end-of-period balances reached a record $63 billion. Operating revenue grew 7% compared to the prior year while G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, increased just 3%, resulting in an approximate 100 basis point decrease in the expense ratio. Base spreads excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year, consistent with expectations. For the quarter, ROA remains stable at 24 basis points. So a strong result for the retirement business, highlighted by the highest quarter of net flows in nearly a decade and continued momentum with back-to-back quarters of double-digit growth in deposits, net flows, assets and earnings.","Turning to the life insurance segment. Earnings of $133 million were up 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to 8% growth in operating revenues. Earnings drivers remain solid in the quarter with life insurance in-force up 4% and average account values up 6%. Revenues were up more than driver growth, driven by the stronger variable investment income I noted upfront. Mortality experience was consistent with expectations as better-than-expected frequency was offset by slightly higher severity. G&A expenses and commissions were somewhat elevated this quarter, primarily due to strong sales production. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down seven basis points year-over-year, consistent with expectations. So a solid quarter for the life business.","With mortality typically more favorable in the second half of the year and steady driver growth in the mid-single digit range, we are well positioned for near and long-term earnings growth in the life business. Group protection earned $35 million compared to $15 million in the prior year quarter. The significant increase in earnings was primarily due to favorable risk experience. The non-medical loss ratio was 66.1% in the quarter, a 640 basis point improvement compared to the prior year as loss ratios were favorable across all product lines. While we wouldn't regularly expect loss ratios to be this strong, this quarter's result clearly speaks to successfully repricing our book of business and continued underwriting discipline on renewals and the new business.","DAC amortization returned to more normal levels in the quarter as expected. The re-emergence of premium growth is also aiding our group business with premiums up 3% from the prior year quarter and leading indicators such as sales and persistency, trending in a positive direction. Bottom line, it was a very strong quarter for the group with a reported margin of 7%. We remain confident that annual margin improvement will continue working towards consistently achieving a 5% to 7% margin","Before moving to Q&A, let me briefly comment on a few other items of note. First, on capital. Both capital and capital generation remain strong, providing significant financial flexibility and an ability to commit capital to new business opportunities, which drive long-term earnings growth and also return capital to shareholders. As I noted upfront, this quarter we returned $265 million, including $200 million in share repurchases, with the remainder through shareholder dividends. Statutory surplus stands at nearly $9 billion, and I estimate the RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 495%. Holding company cash came in above our $500 million target.","So wrapping things up, another excellent quarter for Lincoln. Strong earnings highlighted by record normalized EPS, high quality results as all four businesses delivered revenue and earnings growth while net income represented 98% of operating earnings. Other key shareholder metrics were also strong with book value per share up 9% and an ROE of 12.7%. Finally, capital generation and deployment remain important and consistent parts of our story. With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up and then re-queue if you have additional questions. With that, let me turn it over to Brigitte to begin Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","I was wondering if you could drill into the Athene reinsurance agreement a little bit more. Just specifically what products are included there and then how are the returns given the effect of the reinsurance compared to the in-force block.","Dennis Glass","Yes, Suneet, it's Dennis. We think this is a very significant relationship that we have just developed with Athene, and it will help both organizations building off of what each of us have to contribute to the relationship. It's predominantly fixed indexed annuity and a fixed indexed annuity accumulation product. And it's predominantly, as I said in my remarks, to help us in the broker\/dealer and bank channel.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then in terms of some of the newer products that you're offering, I think the Max 6 Select as well as the iShares product, can you just talk a little bit about traction and if you're still confident that flows will be positive in 2018?","Dennis Glass","Let me answer the second question first. Our expectations are, and we're taking a lot of actions, to produce positive flows in 2018. Stepping back, I think the most important parts of your question are, we are focusing both on making enhancements to products that can give us near- term traction, as well as products that can help in the medium and long term sales growth picture. I think the fee-based products in core income would fall into the latter, which is medium to long term and the enhancements that we're making in product, excuse me, this rider that you just talked about, the MAX 6 rider, are going to help immediately and over the near-term.","Suneet Kamath","And just a follow-up on my earlier question on the reinsurance deal. I mean, so we should think about this as helping you in the bank and broker\/dealer channel as you mentioned, but no significant impact on returns of the business in terms of what's reinsured?","Dennis Glass","We expect to get good returns as we are throughout our entire portfolio of products these days, and we'll price accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","First question on Group where you had a very strong quarter and you sound confident that the momentum will continue. Does this change the timetable at all for when you expect to get to the 5% to 7% margin target?","Randy Freitag","Erik, it doesn't really change our overall thesis, which is that this business is a 5% to 7% business. We expect to hit that regularly as we look forward. We hit 7% this quarter. That's obviously at the upper end of that range, so it's a good quarter. But at the end of the day, it's a quarter that is inside of that range. So I don't consider it to be a quarter that's outside of the potential for this business. I think as you look forward and you look at the underlying drivers of the business, we wouldn't expect that 66% or 66.1% as the long-term loss ratio for this business. So that may move up a little bit. But on the other hand, as premiums start to grow, we would expect that the expense ratio would come down a little bit. So all in, I think this quarter was within our normal range and our expectations for what we would expect in the future haven't really changed. And that is we expect to continue to get, and I said this in my script, improvement in the annual margin that we earn in this business.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And can you talk a little bit more about the demand you're seeing for annuities in the marketplace, and whether the June 9 implementation date for DOL had any material impact on sales volumes? I think related, you've grown VA sales on a sequential basis the last two quarters. Do you think this is more market dynamics or share gains?","Dennis Glass","The enhancements that we've made to our products, the new products that we're adding, are specific to Lincoln and are driving our momentum increase and, again, not only in the near-term, but we think in the long-term with the other products that I mentioned. With respect to the DOL, the June 9 implementation date was very positive in the respect that people had to come forward, our distribution partners came forward with their plans. And in this respect, we're very delighted. 90% of our distribution partners offered at least one, if not more, options for commissions, and that's very helpful. I guess the second thing I would say is coming back to the DOL, as we know there has been more requests or comment. And as we've said all along, we think that the idea, of course doing what's in the best interest of the customer is what's kept us in business for 100 years and it's a good idea. But we've been critical of some of the components of the regulation and based on our interactions with the administration we think there is opportunity to improve the regulation, both for the benefit of the consumer and also to providers like ourselves, who are trying to help people grow their savings and live comfortable in their retirement.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Just a follow-up on this Athene deal. Can you provide a little more color on what exactly this is? Is Athene just a reinsurance partner for you? So they're really a capital provider? What kind of sales do you plan on reinsuring to them, a little more the way this is going to work and if this does anything for freeing up capital for you in that aspect as well?","Dennis Glass","Yes, let me come back to my first comment. We would not have entered into the transaction unless we thought it was significant in the sense of both helping earnings growth, ROE improvement and sales growth. And so we think it is significant. I mentioned in my remarks that it takes advantage of some of the benefits that Athene has from their structure, but it also takes advantage of the tremendous product breadth that we have as well as our distribution. So I think this is one of those programs that will be beneficial to both parties. But we're not going to get into the details other than say that we wouldn't have gone into it if we didn't think it was a significant amount of opportunity.","Tom Gallagher","But Dennis, can I at least ask, is this really a capital efficiency aspect for you? Is it actually helping you expand your sales opportunities, or is it some of both?","Dennis Glass","It's very clearly some of both. Yes.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. Okay. And then my follow-up is, you've had a few large peers take both a life insurance charge from an actuarial review this quarter, as well as a variable annuity reserve strengthening for another one. And I know your review, I believe is still in 3Q, Randy. It's been pretty benign over the last few years. Is there any reason to believe that things have changed a bit in the environment that we should be focused on for your review this year?","Randy Freitag","Tom, at this point, I like you am going to speak very much to the environmental factors. I'm not going to front run this process. I say that every year. In fact, I would imagine if I looked out of my calendar, I would start to see the meetings associated with the DAC unlocking occurring a few weeks from now. So I've had zero meetings. But there are some informational points that I'm going to bring into those meetings and really around the environment that this year's unlocking will occur in. So when I think about the major assumptions that have really driven results in the past, I'd start with the interest rate environment. And when we set our assumption last year, we set an assumption that assumes that interest rates would increase over time. And if you look at what's happened over the last year, underlying treasuries are up probably about 60 basis points from where they were at 9.30 of last year, while spreads have come in a little bit. But net-net, rates have increased in line with our assumption we set last year.","So that's not the final answer but at least environmentally, I know things have moved somewhat how we thought they would last year. When I think about mortality, we set an assumption last year. And if I think about our discussions over the past year, mortality has largely performed in line with our expectations. So once again, environmentally, there isn't anything that I'm going to go into those meetings worried about. And lastly, I'd point out that when you think about the other big drivers, especially on the VA side, you're talking about policyholder behavior. And as we've talked about, there haven't been any big changes in policyholder behavior relative to the experience we've had over many, many years. So we'll come up to a series of meetings with an understanding that the environment, that the unlocking we'll exist in, seems to be pretty good.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Maybe just a housekeeping question as my model not occurred at this level in a really long time. But when was the last time RPS net inflows were as high as they were in 2Q '17?","Dennis Glass","We'll have to get back to you on that. It's been a little while.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then SEC Commissioner Piwowar put out a comment letter last week. What are your view of efforts by the DOL and SEC to work together on a joint fiduciary standard?","Dennis Glass","What was the question? What's our view? Excuse me, our view is absolutely we think harmonizing a fiduciary rule across all the regulators, including the life Insurance regulators by the way, is the best thing in the world for the consumer. It's the best thing in the world for all the companies. Again, we're trying to help consumers build for retirement and live comfortably in retirement.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan with Wells Fargo.","Sean Dargan","I don't mean to beat a dead horse with Athene, but what does the reinsurance agreement allow you to do in the bank and broker\/dealer channels that you couldn't do on your own? Is it just grow faster because of the capital efficiency?","Dennis Glass","Everybody knows what Athene's model is and it's slightly different than ours in terms of the location of their entity and the benefits they get from that. They have a little different investment philosophy than we do. On the other hand, I think generally not just as compared to Athene but as compared to all of our competitors, we have a much stronger distribution capability, again not just compared to Athene but across the industry. So it's trying to take advantage of what each of us brings to the table and I'll come back to it and say that it's a good outcome for both of us and we're excited about it.","Sean Dargan","Okay. Thanks. Then in the past, I think you've said that a goal is to reach 30% to 35% of total enterprise earnings coming from mortality and morbidity businesses. If the group margins kind of hit your target range, will you be able to do that organically? Or is reaching that goal something that would require an acquisition?","Randy Freitag","Sean, we've been pretty consistent on this that organically, we can grow the contribution. As the group earnings were depressed over the last couple of years, that contribution had fallen to the low-20's for mortality, morbidity. But just organically as group earnings recover, as life earnings continue to grow, that we could grow that into the mid-20's range, so 25%, 27% or so. But to fill that gap between there and the 30% to 33% long-term strategic target we would like to hit, would take some level of inorganic activity.","Sean Dargan","All right. And can you give us an update on what your capacity for inorganic activity is? Has anything changed in the last quarter?","Randy Freitag","No, nothing has changed. Last quarter, we spiked out the potential to get up as high as $2 billion. That was a mixture of capital on our balance sheet, $500 million to $750 million, some capacity to issue some debt supporting a strategic acquisition, and then the ability and the knowledge that we have been allocating a significant amount of capital to things like buybacks. So as you announced and then go through the process of waiting for a transaction to close, you have the ability to build up some capital that way also.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee with Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Lee","Just staying on group protection. So if I were to think about getting to that 5% to 7% after-tax margin, do you feel like you can kind of do that with a loss ratio kind of at the, maybe low-70s or maybe kind of high 60s to low 70s, without materially growing the base of your premiums? Or does the 5% to 7% margin target would contemplate some kind of mix shift or better underwriting kind of trending below the high 60%, but maybe a little bit above the 66% this quarter?","Dennis Glass","Humphrey, we have seen a shift in the mix of our business. There's more of a voluntary component than there was four, five years ago. Four, five years ago, our targeted range around loss ratios would have been 70% to 74%. So you have seen some mix and I would say that the target has moved down somewhat. So once again, 66.1% is below our long-term expectations, but I don't think that when you look at a long-term that we would expect a long-term target to be above 70%. I think it's, as you mentioned, it's more in the high-60s, 68%, 69%, somewhere in there. And then offsetting that, as I mentioned, we would expect our expense ratio tick down over time as that business continues to grow its premium base.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, understood. And then in terms of capital deployment. So it seems like variable annuity sales are starting to kind of pick up back a little bit and I think at the beginning of the year, you talked about the capital return would probably be kind of similar to your last year level or at least somewhat elevated because of a slowdown in sales. But if we were to continue to see VA sales continue to pick up, how should we think about the pace of buyback in the balance of the year?","Dennis Glass","Humphrey, we said for this year that we would be 60% to 65%. This quarter we were at 63%. Year-to-date, we're at 62%. You couldn't be much closer to the middle of that target range we gave. So the implication for that is that the expectation latter half of the year isn't too different than it was in the first half of the year. We fully expect to end the year between 60% to 65% of operating earnings.","Operator","I'm not showing any further questions, so I'll now turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Brigitte. Just following up on John Barnidge's question, as Randy noted in the script, that's quarter of net flows in the earlier decade, first quarter of 2009 for RPS. So thank you all for joining us this morning. As always, we will take your questions on our investor relations line at 800-237-2920 or via email at investorrelations@lfg.com.

And thank you for joining Lincoln Financial Group's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Later, we will announce the opportunity for questions and instructions will be giving at that time. [Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln Financial\u2019s website www.lincolnfinancial.com where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity to their most comparable GAAP measures. One finally that I want to remind you that Lincoln will hold an Investor Day in New York City on June 9. We hope that many of you will be able to join us there.","Presenting on today\u2019s call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","With that I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. Fourth quarter results once again demonstrated the resilience of Lincoln\u2019s franchise, as we had a solid finish in what proved to be a volatile year for capital markets. Our EPS excluding notable items increased 5% in the fourth quarter. Under the same measure for the full year our EPS also increased 5%, which resulted in a ROE of just over 12%.","As we begin 2016, we recognize that there are number of questions around the impact of weak capital markets on our businesses and Randy will discuss this later. However, it\u2019s important note, we have placid momentum in key business drivers and our strategic initiatives are enabling us to execute on our growth, profitability and capital management initiatives.","Some of that - examples of these include consolidated net flows of 1.4 billion in the quarter, nearly doubled to prior year quarter and up 9% for the full year. Individual life insurance sales increased 11% in the fourth quarter, while total life insurance sales were up 8% in 2015.","Our book value per share excluding AOIC is now over $52, a record and up 6% from the prior area. Balance sheet strength combined with solid capital generation enabled us to deploy another 250 million towards buybacks and dividends in the fourth quarter, increasing our total capital return to shareholders in 2015 to $1.1 billion.","Now, turning to our business lines starting with individual life, as I noted up front, individual life insurance sales were very strong this quarter, up 11% of total life insurance sales of 725 million in 2015 or up more than 8%. It is worth spending a few minutes digging into some product stories as sales from many of our products increased double digits in the fourth quarter.","MoneyGuard sales increased 15%, as we continued to benefit from market acceptance of our MoneyGuard II product and traction in recently approved states growths. For the full year MoneyGuard had record sales.","Indexed Universal Life sales increased 13%, as we were helped by a new product launch and regulation that began in September that required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates. This resulted in an improvement in our competitive position. Finally, Term up 19% and VUL up 12%, also benefited from product enhancements.","As a reminder our focus on sales is not just to grow, but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and the tilt away from long-term guarantees. In the fourth quarter, we once again achieved these objectives. With expected new business returns within our targeted range of 12% to 15% and those single products represented more than 30% of our total production.","Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Our outlook for life insurance business remains positive as our diversified product portfolio combined with the depth and breadth of our distribution distinguishes Lincoln in the market place.","Turning to group protection, we\u2019re pleased with continued progress we are making with our re-pricing efforts and the improvement of our claims management effectiveness. Earnings once again increased from depressed results in the prior year quarter.","Fourth quarter sales of 223 million were down 11% from the same period last year and full year sales were down 16%. With our pricing actions on the poor performing employer paid slot [ph] largely behind us, our renewal actions have moderated. So we continue to build additional margins into our book of business.","As our pricing actions are stabilized, the degree of market disruption has been reduced and we see the pace of the sales activity improving. For example, our disability sales decreased just 9% in the quarter after being down 30% through the first nine months of 2015.","We expect continued improvement in sales activity and growth to reemerge during 2016 after two straight years of declining sales. This will be important as we look to drive future margin improvement by growing premiums and sustaining our pricing discipline.","Turning to annuities, our annuity business remains a high quality source of earnings, as we posted strong operating results and minimal hedge breakage in the quarter. Total annuity sales were 3 billion and we continued to consistently generate positive organic growth with 435 million of net flows in the quarter and 1.6 billion for the full year.","As I noted last quarter, market volatility dampened demand for most equity sense of products, including variable annuities and it was hard to tell if the Department of Labor proposal was also having an impact on industry sales. Given continued interest on the DOL combined obvious overhang on our stock we wanted to give you more specifics how we are internally approaching the DOL proposal.","First, it is important to note that there are a number of possible outcomes which we\u2019re planning for, including some I have mentioned in the past that would be less owners on these than the original proposal. This morning I was specifically focused on this scenario where no changes are made to the current proposal, as that is the situation we get asked about most frequently. While this is the most adverse scenario, it is manageable for Lincoln.","So I would note a few things. One, in the fourth quarter we had nearly $0.5 million of positive net flows, only 30% of our sales came from products that would be impacted by the DOL proposal, namely variable annuities within qualified plans. This compares to nearly 60% for the top 10 VA riders.","Point two, it is also important to note, the DOL proposal does not impact the nonqualified market where our patented i4LIFE has long been known as the income product of choice and has resulted in Lincoln being the market leader in nonqualified VA sales.","Point three, a few years back we decided to focus on diversifying our mix of annuity sales, tilting away from VAs with living benefits and lowering our risk profile, without having a meaningful impact on returns.","As part of this pivot our sales of our sales of products that are not impacted by the DOL proposal has increased to 70% of total sales, up from 50% pre-pivot. Importantly, given our focus and momentum on diversification, we would expect this percentage to continue to increase, further reducing our dependence on sales impacted by the DOL proposal.","My next point, sales of VA in qualified plans will not entirely go away as the current proposal allows some products to be sold on a commissionable basis and many distributors will continue to offer the important guarantees that VAs provide. In addition, we would expect to see accelerated growth in our fee-based VA products, as we have been approached by many of our largest distribution partners about the fee-based opportunity. We\u2019re also increasing our focus on fixed and indexed annuities, which still have the PTE 8424 exemption.","Finally, recall we have said that if there is a sales disruption, we would be able to reallocate capital to share buybacks to block much of the EPS impact over the next several years as we pivot to the extent required, a skill and capability we have successfully demonstrated in the past. So, I believe companies like Lincoln with market leader positions and F-scale that have a broad portfolio of products along with leading distribution, will continue to succeed.","Let me turn to retirement plan services. In retirement plan services, earnings and net flows were consistent with our outlook. Total deposits for the quarter of 2.1 billion, were down 10%, however, excluding one large case from the prior year, deposit increased nearly 40%.","Full-year results for a very good story with a record total deposits of $7.5 billion, supported by strength in both small and mid to large markets. Notably, small market deposits were up 18% to a record 2.1 billion and mid to large market one, two times as many plants as compared to the prior year.","Total outflows for the quarter were negative 220 million and included a large-case termination we referenced on our third quarter call. Full-year net flows increased to 452 million, compared to outflows of 881 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by our strong deposits and improvement in our retention rate, as we benefit from our strategic investments.","Looking ahead to 2016, we would not be surprised to see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in net flows. However, we expect our net flows will exceed 2015 levels. This confidence is driven by our strategy, which aligns the fastest growing market with customers that value our high-touch service model. This combination enables us to better defend profitability and achieve our target returns. Bottom line, we remain optimistic in the growth outlook for our retirement business.","Lastly on investment management, we put new money to work in the fourth quarter at an average yield of 4.3%, which was consistent with recent quarters and 210 basis points over the average ten-year treasury. Following strong results in our alternatives portfolio in the third quarter, alternatives did not contribute to earnings this quarter, which makes our EPS growth even more impressive. Over the last four years, our alternatives portfolio has returned more than 10% annually at a level we target over the long run.","Our investment portfolio is high quality and diversified by industry, geography, and insurance. We ended the year with a net unrealized gain of approximately 3 billion and our below investment grade exposure is just 5.1% of invested assets, a slight improvement from the prior year.","With the recent volatility and weakness in the energy market, I want to update you on our exposure. First, it is worth noting that we stopped investing in the energy sector a year ago. And since the end of 2014, we have reduced our fixed income energy exposure by nearly $1 billion. This included approximately 400 million in maturities and roughly 600 million of asset sales based on an assessment of our exposures with our external asset managers. Importantly, these sales produced fewer losses than what was in our capital plan.","At year-end, the market value of our 8.6 billion energy portfolio was 95% of book value. Our high-yield energy exposure was about 600 million up modestly from the prior-year due to ratings migration and represented just 7.5% of our energy exposure. We continued to proactively monitor and manage our energy exposure.","So in closing, I\u2019m very pleased we were able to grow EPS mid-single digits in 2015, despite equity market declines, persistently low interest rates, and mortality fluctuations. We showed great progress on several strategic initiatives, including restoring profitability and group protection, growth in RPS highlighted by significant improvement in net flows, continued momentum in our annuity ticket, which positions us well for the DOL and strong life new business returns. Bottom line, we remain confident in our franchise and our ability to grow earnings.","With that, let me turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of 382 million or $1.54 per share for the fourth quarter. The current quarter did not include any notable items and as Dennis mentioned, EPS increased 5% year-over-year excluding $0.20 of favorable items in the prior year quarter, primarily related to our reinsurance recapture. Under the same measure, full-year EPS increased 5% to $6.04.","One other item to point to specific to the fourth quarter, alternative investment income was 18 million below our plan or $0.07 per share. Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, all of which normalized for notable items, top line growth remained strong with operating revenue up 6% for the quarter and for the full-year driven by positive net flows in every quarter of the year and product mix shift.","Continued focus on managing the expenses created further margin expansion as the 4% growth in annual G&A net of capitalized expenses trailed revenue growth. Book value per share excluding AOCI was 6% to $52.38.","Operating return on equity came in at 12% for the quarter and 12.2% for the full year. Our balance sheet remains an important source of strength with strong capital and liquidity metrics, which gives us significant financial flexibility.","And finally, our year-end cash flow testing continues to point to significant statutory reserve adequacy and we do not anticipate reserve deficiencies in any of our entities. And we completed our good will review and did not have any impairment\u2019s.","Net income results for the quarter were negatively impacted by a few items, the largest of which was a noneconomic charge of 43 million related to nonperformance risk, which is the result of our own credit spread narrowing in the quarter. Hedge breakage was modest at just 13 million.","Before moving to segment results, I wanted to provide some perspective on the current market environment. First, on the recent activity market weakness, this obviously presents a headwind to earnings growth and we\u2019ve been very clear on the sensitivity, roughly $9 million for every 1% move in equity markets. Also, it is worth reminding you that we have a reverse into the mean approach within our DAC models and as of year-end, it\u2019s provided a cushion against weak equity markets.","Next, the interest rate environment, we know that our interest rates remain topical, but it's important to recognize that we have effectively managed through persistently low rates and we\u2019ll continue to do so. Importantly, our product portfolio has been re-priced over the past several years to reflect a low interest rate environment. And last quarter, we lowered our long-term earned rate, which leaves us very well positioned with this particular assumption.","Bottom line, low rates remain just an earnings headwind and the impact is consistent with the 2% to 3% we have noticed in the past. So, despite the current capital market environment, we remain confident in our ability to grow EPS.","Now, I will turn to segment results and starting with annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were 243 million, a 3% increase over the last year. Operating revenues increased to 12% from the fourth quarter of 2014, as premiums benefited from an increase in fixed annuity deposits. Positive net flows in every quarter of 2015 resulted in average account balances reaching the 124 billion, up 4%.","Return metrics remained strong and consistent with recent periods. For the full year ROA increased three basis points, while ROE came in at 24%. Notably, return on equity has exceeded 20% for the past three years and has averaged 20% for nearly a decade. Outstanding results that highlight the returns that are high-quality annuity book can deliver.","In retirement plan services, we reported earnings of $33 million. Fourth-quarter revenue growth was unchanged year-over-year without annual revenue growth up 1%. Average account values ended the year at $54 billion, up 3% compared to 2014, driven by positive net flows. Normalized spreads compressed 11 basis points for the year. This is at the low end of our guidance and looking forward we continue to expect spreads to decline by 10 to 15 basis points.","Return on assets was 25 basis points for the fourth quarter and 26 basis points for the full year. 2015 was a good year for the retirement business, highlighted by record deposits, nearly $0.5 billion dollars of net flows and returns that fell within our targeted range. While earnings will fight the headwinds of low interest rates in weak equity markets start of the year, we expect to see continued growth in net flows.","The life insurance segment reported fourth-quarter earnings of $119 million, compared to a $140 million last year after normalizing items primarily related to the reinsurance recapture. Of the 18 million of below plan alternative investments that I noted upfront, 12 million of it is the life business.","Mortality results were consistent with the third quarter following elevated experience in the first half of 2015. But I would notice the mix of claims was a little different, so the financial impact was slightly worse than we would have hoped. An example of this would be a higher proportion of Term plans that have less reserve offsets than a typical interest sensitive claim.","Normalized spreads in the fourth quarter were down two basis points quarter-over-quarter and down six basis points for the full year. Looking forward, we continue to expect spreads to decline by 5 to 10 basis points on an annual basis. Earnings drivers remain steady for the quarter and year with the average account balances up 3% to 4% and life insurance in force, up 3%.","Overall, this year\u2019s earnings were dragged down by elevated mortality, which overshadowed strong sales results. While we continue to assume first-quarter results will be negatively impacted by typical seasonality, we do not expect 2015\u2019s elevated mortality to persist in the coming year. Group protection earnings of 13 million compared to a loss of 7 million with the prior year quarter.","Our non-medical loss ratio improved to 75.3% from 81% in the prior year quarter driven by our life and disability product lines, which benefited from pricing actions and improvements in disability claims management. For the full year, our loss ratio improved by 300 basis points and we expect further progress in 2016.","Our renewal pricing actions continue to have a favorable impact on margins, but they have negatively impacted persistency in sales. The result of the non-medical earned premiums decreased 5% compared to the prior year quarter. Our extensive re-pricing of policy renewals also has an impact on DAC amortization. With the first quarter of heaviest renewal period, the amortization impact is greatest in this period.","In the first quarter, we expect this acceleration of DAC to pressure earnings relative for the most recent run rate. So overall, another quarter that validates, we are on a path to earnings recovery and we expect further improvement in our underwriting profitability in 2016. As with the sales momentum Dennis mentioned starts to build and emerges into premium, we believe margins will continue to improve.","Let me discuss capital management and our capital position before we turn to Q&A. This quarter we repurchased 200 million of Lincoln shares. For the full year, we repurchased 900 million of stock, which is a 38% increase from the prior year. When combined with a 25% increase in our dividend per share, total deployment to shareholders increased to $1.1 billion.","We have a proven ability to generate free cash flow and as importantly, we have actually returned to that cash to shareholders, with share buybacks totally $3.1 billion over the last five years and dividends more than tripling over the same period.","Historically, I have pointed to 45% to 50% of operating earnings as a good proxy for free cash flow. But what is available for buybacks and dividends? Based on the shift in our product mix, notably the successful pivots within our life and annuity businesses, I\u2019m increasing our outlook to 50% to 55%.","This positions us well to remain active returning capital to shareholders and the recent weakness in the share price enables us to acquire stock below book value, an excellent use of capital. It is also worth noting our revised free cash flow estimate does not include the reallocation of capital under the adverse DOL scenario Dennis spoke to earlier.","Quickly, on capital and liquidity where we are extremely well positioned with statutory surplus at 8.4 billion and an estimated RBC ratio of 490%, holding company cash at 608 million is well above our target of 500 million and we remain comfortable with our current leveraging capital structure and you would know our next debt maturity is not until 2018.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the Q&A portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask you to please limit yourself to one question and just one follow-up, then re-queue if you have additional questions. So, with that, let me turn things over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR. Your line is open.","Randy Binner","Great, good morning, thanks. Lots of things to touch on, but I guess I\u2019ll start with Randy at the end there, in the buybacks, so you have some positive commentary around free cash flow and generally good comments are on the business, the stocks down quite a bit as you mentioned below book value. So, is there any way that you can kind of guess the buyback here and accelerate what you might do to take advantage of the low share price?","Randy Freitag","Hey, Randy, thanks for the question. When you look at our buyback practices over the last four or five years, we\u2019d pointed you to 45% to 50% of free cash flow. In actuality, we exceeded that. We averaged about 51% of the normalized - the extra 200 million we did last year related to the reinsurance recapture.","So, we have been leveraging our balance sheet to take advantage. At times we felt the stock price was depressed and we did that in the third and fourth quarter as we stepped in and elevated our share repurchase of 200 million. So, we're definitely cognizant of share price and we will definitely step in when we think that the share price is depressed, which definitely we see today.","All that being said, we are going to be cognizant of the environment that exists today and the environment appears to be a little riskier than it was three to six months ago. So, we are going to take that into account. But we're definitely going to be active in the share repurchase market and step in and reflect the fact that we're generating strong free cash flows to increase our guidance and we will access the strength of our balance sheet when we see it reasonable.","Randy Binner","When you see the macro environment has been more risky, is it for you - from where you said for Lincoln, is it more of a credit risk issue or is it more of kind of a continued low for a long interested environment issue?","Dennis Glass","Yeah, I think for us if you think about the risks, the risk associated with declining equity markets are covered by our hedge program, which continues to perform at a very high level. So, you really don't see a balance sheet issue from there, you see earnings that went up stock [ph] to about a $9 million per 1% decrease. You have interest-rate risk and I talked about that not really being a balance sheet issue at this point in time and it's still just an earnings headwind issue and so we continue to manage that. So, from a balance sheet standpoint, it becomes credit risk. We haven\u2019t been through a credit cyclone a while and we may be entering or we may not be. Now, as we enter [Indiscernible] - I feel very comfortable with our overall position and very strong balance sheet, a balance sheet that, arguably is in a position to handle any stress that comes its way. So, we feel very comfortable with where we are. But I would agree with you that overall this is primarily a stress that will feature credit.","Randy Binner","All right. Thanks a lot.","Dennis Glass","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Dally of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks, good morning. So, first question was on the DOL. You mentioned the fee-based VAs an alternative to get around some of the DOL restrictions. Can you comment on the average ten profile of fee-based versus commission-based VAs, and just on that point, the distributors they haven\u2019t had the systems in place to offer annuities on their fee-based platform towards that some more of an intermediate solution?","Dennis Glass","Nigel, this is Dennis. I'm sorry; you broke up a little bit there. Could you repeat the question?","Nigel Dally","Sure. Just on the Department of Labor, potentially introducing fee-based VAs as a way to get around some of those restrictions, just hoping to get some differential as to how the returns favor on fee-based versus commission-based and also where the distributors had the systems in place to battle the sell fee-based VA?","Dennis Glass","Yeah, on the returns, they would be roughly equivalent between a front end commission and a trailer type fee-based product; I mean that's the way that we would price the product. The second point, again I'm not quite sure on. But as I said in my remarks, I think I heard it correctly, there are people who are looking for ways to get valuable living benefits to their customers and looking at our fee-based products, which we\u2019ve already developed. We don't do a lot of that today. But with the DOL, it pushes some of the distributors in that direction. We have the product portfolio to respond positively.","Nigel Dally","Okay, and then just second one, Randy, this question to you, do you have the unrealized loss on the high-yield portion of those exposures?","Randy Freitag","Yeah, let me answer to that question. I think - but I know at the end of the fourth quarter, the unrealized loss was about $500 million and with spreads widening in the energy portfolio grew a couple of 100 million.","Nigel Dally","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath of UBS. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, I wanted to start with the life business in the outlook for alternative investments, given that some of this is reported on a lag, Randy, do you have a sense of how 1Q is shaping up and have you changed your view in terms of alternatives for full-year \u201816?","Randy Freitag","Suneet, thanks for the question. No, we really haven't changed our view, as you know - as we report alternative returns, you have the private equity piece, which makes up roughly two-thirds of our portfolio, which is reported on a one-quarter lag and so that will be linked to the third quarter of 2015, which was a pretty good quarter in the equity markets. So, I think you will see that in the results. Separate from that, you have hedge funds, which reported on a one-month lag, so you will see some of the first quarter impact inside of the hedge fund returns. But overall, it hasn\u2019t causes to change our overall guidance or thoughts on what alternatives will return over a more extended period of time. But also note that when you think about alternatives, especially portfolio of ours, which is not that big at $1.2 billion, you can get that one-off situation where a particular investment in our size return, one also lost in a [ph] particular period, so you also have to think about those sorts of things.","Suneet Kamath","Okay and then just pivoting to the DOL, Dennis, in your opening comments, which were helpful, I think you spent some time talking about qualified versus nonqualified, and I guess the question is as we talk to some of our industry contacts, there is a view in the industry that whatever happens to the qualified market will ultimately in some ways you perform happen to the nonqualified market as the SEC opines on fiduciary standards. That's what we're hearing from industry contacts. I wanted to get a sense of what your thoughts are on that?","Dennis Glass","Well, my thoughts? We don't even know what the DOL rules are going to be yet and there is a lot of speculation about what they might become. Some people more positive, some people more negative. So I thank it's even harder to speculate about what the SEC might do with respect to any outcome that comes out of the DOL\u2019s proposal. So, I just think it's very hard to speculate and I would say with some confidence that anything you hear is just pure speculation, could be right or it could be wrong.","Chris Giovanni","This is Chris. I just want to clean up one item just on the comment around the unrealized losses, the $500 million was, as of the end of the third quarter, the other additional 200 was through the fourth quarter. And operator if we could move to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning, everybody. First question is more strategic, I guess, strategic thinking. Given that the market does not seem to be giving Lincoln shares the credit for the diversification of the business and the high returns and given what we\u2019ve seen announce from one of your competitors about potential split up, does that kind of thought - is there room for such thought in the Lincoln\u2019s board room today or is it something like that you consider?","Dennis Glass","Consider? It's a pretty open question. The big picture answer to, I think - are you asking if we would change the makeup of our company and the way MET is changing the makeup of their company?","Yaron Kinar","Yeah.","Dennis Glass","Yeah. I'm just going to answer that by saying we believe in the businesses that we are in, subject to all the comments that we\u2019ve made about them today. We're making progress overall, some things to do better. But at the end of the day, obviously and we\u2019ve demonstrated this from the past, whatever is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders and I say long-term interest of our shareholders, I think reactions to ups and downs in the stock price in a short period of time is not the way we think about things. It\u2019s just over the long-term we are building value for our shareholders.","And with respect to MET, let me just make a couple of comments. One, Steve is a great guy and he has got strong management team and I\u2019m sure whatever they end up doing is going to benefit the shareholders. When I come back to their individual life business and I think about it from a competitive perspective, us competing against them, is I understand what - the attempt to achieve or the split up is to get the US life business out from underneath the SIFI regulations and what that would do importantly for them from a capital perspective, put them on the same footing as Lincoln and the rest of the industry.","So from that perspective, they are just sort of getting back on a level playing field from a capital perspective and we don\u2019t compete against companies on the basis of uneven capital regime. So that [Indiscernible] doesn\u2019t bother us. And so, when I think about that, US versus Lincoln, first of all, we have much more diversification in our business than what I understand they\u2019ll end up with. And from back to competition, we have such a strong distribution franchise. We have such a strong breadth of product portfolio. Just comparatively we sell twice as much life and annuity as MET does. So I think they will be a good competitor. They have a solid base in the United States. But the strength of Lincoln to competition, to capability from a competitive stance, I think our capabilities are strong and are going to continue to grow.","Suneet Kamath","Thank you for the pretty thoughtful answer. One quick follow-up, can you tell us how much remains in the reversions in the quarter today.","Randy Freitag","Hey Ron, we are at above $165 million in total for the annuity in retirement business, with the vast majority of that in the annuity business.","Suneet Kamath","And that\u2019s as of end of the fourth quarter.","Randy Freitag","Yeah, the end of fourth quarter.","Suneet Kamath","Okay thank you","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean Dargan of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Sean Dargan","Good morning, I have a question about a potential adverse DOL scenario, so you talked about the pivot to other products, if you couldn\u2019t sell as much VA in the qualified market, but as I through that it might take a while to complete that pivot and even if a stock is trading below book value, is it safe to say that you would make up for any potential loss EPS from VA sales by buying back your stock in the meantime.","Dennis Glass","Yes, I made that comment in my remarks and I\u2019ll just confirm it. Yes, absolutely we will do that. We did that if you recall a couple of years ago when we were reprising our life insurance portfolio and we slowed sales down because we were not getting the appropriate returns when interest rates dropped and I think that created about 200 million of capital that would otherwise gone into new product sales instead it went to share buyback. So if that were to happen, it being DOL more disruptive than we expect, absolutely we\u2019ll take that capital and buy our shares back and we as we\u2019ve said that would mitigate any earnings per share impact from lower VA sales.","Sean Dargan","Got it, thanks and when I think about your RBC at almost 500%. I was wondering if you have any - if you done any sensitivity analysis, thinking if we\u2019re going to credit cycle and I\u2019m not saying we are, but at any point 6 billion energy portfolio, if the securities in there were downgraded in average of one notch, do you have any idea what that would do to your RBC?","Randy Freitag","Yes, Sean, this is Randy. Yeah, one notch downgrade across the entire $8.6 billion portfolio, roughly 15 to 20 points of RBC.","Sean Dargan","Great, thank you.","Randy Freitag","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hi, good morning everybody, Randy maybe just a question. I think this is just more about trying to understand the seasonality pattern for mortality I am thinking about the life insurance segment, obviously 1Q of 2015 was weaker than you guys would typically expect just the seasonality would produce. Can you walk us through what you expect in the more normalized environment seasonality look like?","Randy Freitag","Sure, at the highest level we expect the first business in individualized mortality, we expect the first quarter to be elevated and the middle two quarters of the year to be somewhat in line with expectations and then in the fourth quarter you get back what you are over in the first quarter, that\u2019s at a high level what you would expect. Of course you\u2019re going to get some movement around there. If you remember last year in the first quarter, you\u2019re going to test my memory but I believe we were 28 million of the number we talked about over our expectations and I think we talked about that maybe being a little high from a seasonality standpoint, but not that out of way but what a typical seasonality would see in the first quarter. So that\u2019s what I would say.","John Nadel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then I guess my second question is just thinking about the 50% to 55% and I think as we moved into 2015 a year ago, you talked about expecting buybacks to be roughly similar to the level in 2014 obviously 2015 benefited from the capital freed up from the reinsurance recapture. Should we expect '16 level of buybacks to look similar to '15, excluding that $200 million of what I guess we would characterize as more one-time in nature.","Randy Freitag","So what I actually said coming into 2015 was that we would exceed what we did in 2014 and what we did in 2014 was 650 million. So we actually exceeded that by $250 million. This year we did 900 million and it did include 200 million associated with the reinsurance recapture. I would also say that over the last two quarters of the year you saw us step in and do an incremental $50 million a quarter really leveraging the balance sheet. So when I think about the year the 900 million and the 200 million and I think about stepping in and doing about additional 100 million for the full year over and above what we might have thought otherwise.","John Nadel","Got it. Perfectly helpful. Thank you very much.","Randy Freitag","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Steven Schwartz","Thank you, hey good morning everybody. Just one more Dennis could on the DOL maybe two more on the DOL. The colors that you made about share repurchase mitigating or someone mitigating the hit to variable annuities obviously nobody wants to think about this, but I would imagine that there would be cost savings as well.","Dennis Glass","I think the way to think about that is that if sales were reduced you\u2019d have to associate and reduce the variable expenses associated with those sales but I don\u2019t think there is much cost savings on top of the share buybacks that would come out of that kind of a scenario.","Steven Schwartz","All right, thank you Dennis and then just switching the emphasis, obviously VA has taken up most of people\u2019s attention, but could you talk to me a little bit about retirement plan. I know a lot of that is teachers and I don\u2019t think they get affected, but I\u2019m not sure how much.","Dennis Glass","By the DOL.","Steven Schwartz","Yeah.","Dennis Glass","Roughly as it stands today, there\u2019s not a best interest contract exemption or participant plans of less than a hundred and that\u2019s about 30% of our business. And so it is roughly the same.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, so yeah - so that would have to go entirely fee-based and be under fiduciary rules without the fact that I would think that would be a negative but I don\u2019t know.","Dennis Glass","All right let\u2019s make sure that we are on the same page, for some reason I am having a hard time hearing some of these questions. So your question was how much of our current business in retirement is affected by the DOL.","Steven Schwartz","Right and you said 30%.","Dennis Glass","I missed both [ph] it\u2019s about 10%.","Steven Schwartz","Okay, that\u2019s much lower, okay. All right, okay thank you Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Okay. I would like to come back to one question and I apologize, not sure what the connection problem here is, but I was asked about - I thought I was asked about the unrealized loss increase in our total energy portfolio which I answered went from 500 million at the end of the third quarter up a couple of hundred million. But I am - I think actually the specific question was the unrealized loss in BIG portfolio below investment grade portfolio, which is only a fractional amount, so for clarification a fraction of the total amount.","Randy Freitag","Thank you operator, we can go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney. Your line is open.","Bob Glasspiegel","Good morning Lincoln. I think Randy this maybe a little bit stale, but a few quarters ago you said 10% yield on partnership alternatives is normal and 20 million a quarter is the run rate, is that still sort of your base case assumption and was that - I think you said 7 million low in Q4 was that off a 20 million sort of run rate.","Randy Freitag","Yeah, Bob thanks for the question and I think as Dennis mentioned 10% is still our expectations. Over time the portfolio as we said here today has about a billion two. So you can do the math, pretax of $30 million a quarter. As I mentioned this quarter, as Dennis mentioned we had no alternative investment income and I size that about 18 million after DAC and tax in my script.","Bob Glasspiegel","That\u2019s very helpful, thank you.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Bob.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Hey, I want to ask what your thoughts are on anything you are hearing on the regulatory front for VA captives. I think we\u2019ve had another company out there prudential announce they are going to fold in their captive and I\u2019ve heard varying stories about companies views of how this is likely to unfold, but - and any comments can you give on that and do you - are you planning on recapturing your captive? I think you\u2019ve mentioned in the past what the impact would be if you could update us on that as well in terms of whether it\u2019s neutral or positive or negative for RBC.","Dennis Glass","Hi, Tom I don\u2019t know what you are hearing from other people, but I\u2019ve personally been negotiating at least discussing this with the executive committee of NAIC and so I think I have a pretty good handle on the direction that it\u2019s going. So let me make a couple of comments. The high level objective of the review is to eliminate the statutory and GAAP reserve issue that has to do simply with market value versus book value accounting. And the regulators understand that there should be a regulation in place where you can\u2019t protect yourself against both potential challenges which you have to pick one or the other, okay. So what they are doing to is eliminate this negative arbitrage between - sometimes it\u2019s called economics, sometimes it\u2019s called book value, but the intent is to try to find a way to eliminate that having to choose one versus the other.","The proposal that has come out very definitely goes in that direction, and so there is an intent again to improve the regulation, both for the benefit of the regulators as well as the benefit of the companies. So that\u2019s the direction it\u2019s moving, [indiscernible] is about to start studying and sort of try to measure this problem from all of the different companies data, so that\u2019s substitute what is going on. Specifically with respect to captives, the need for the captives, if this goes in the direction it seems to be going is lessened and the current thinking at the NAIC is that even though it is lessened, whatever captives are in place will be grandfathered [ph]. So I generally see this as moving in a very positive direction for the entire VA industry and the regulators, having said that there is a long way to go before we get to final regulations.","Randy Freitag","Tom, let me answer the second part of your question. No, we have I think no need to recapture our captive at this point in time. Over a long term as Dennis mentioned we are glad about the way the NAIC is moving and we will see what our thoughts are if and when those rules get change. But in the interim, no need or recent event [ph] - let me expand and explain a little bit why I think that is. Every company has its own facts and circumstances and I am not going to speak to why or why not other companies would or would not recapture the captives. But Lincoln\u2019s facts and circumstance is around this issue are the following. The way we have operated our captive over the years with a hedge program linked to the economics has left us in a very desirable position and that we have a significant amount of hard assets that exceed above the economic based liability and at the end of the year, they exceeded them by 1.4 billion and significantly exceed these statutory reserve credit required. At the end of the year they exceeded statutory reserve credit by $900 million.","So the way we\u2019ve operated our captive in the past from a reserving standpoint, from a hedging standpoint has left us in a very favorable position that - a position that I don\u2019t believe all companies necessarily share. The second thing I would point out is that we have capitalized our VA business also contributes to that very favorable position. So we capitalize our variable annuity guarantee business is that we have a formula that has a great approach is that greater of CT98 [ph] and a floor percentage of account that is actually for a while now that floor is being controlling item inside of the capital formula, but the CT98 is a very high level, high threshold from a capital standpoint. Factually if we were to take that CT98 down to CT95 which is where I hear some of my peer companies talk about the capitalization at you would actually see a billion less of required capital against their VA business. So we are in a very good position, recapturing our captive would have very little impact at all on the parent company where we do that and that is directly linked to how we have operated this company in the past both from a hedging standpoint and from a capitalization standpoint.","Tom Gallagher","That\u2019s really helpful Randy and then just one follow up and this is more a comment in my opinion as supposed to a question, but I think - given the position you are in, I think it would be a real positive if you all would consider in the interest of better transparency recapturing the captive particularly if it\u2019s that strong. I think, right now I think, there is just generally speaking basically using captives there is confusion in terms of how do you compare versus others and sort of what it might mean, if it does move in the direction of where companies get pushed to move things to an up co, but anyways, so that\u2019s - so I think just from a perception, from a transparency standpoint I think it would be positive if you moved in that direction. Anyway just wanted to make that comment.","Randy Freitag","We appreciate as always your insights Tom. As I mentioned I just don\u2019t see that happening. The one benefit that you do get really from having a captive is that your spread from the volatility created by the difference between book value and market value accounting, that $900 million of assets in excess of statutory requirement, next quarter it maybe 1.1 billion a quarter, after that it may be 700 million, but I think that\u2019s the real benefit. And we will do everything we can to continue to bring sunshine to the fact that our captive is operated in a very robust way just exactly consistent with the way we operate our - the parent, but thank you and always I appreciate your insights.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much and good morning to Dennis and the rest of your team. Dennis you indicated at the beginning of the call that your percentage of sales in variable annuities in qualified plans I think you said is roughly half of that of your peers. My first question, with respect to the qualified business that you do right, can you remind us and I apologize if I missed this, of the split within the qualified between guaranteed product and non-guaranteed product and as part of your response could you answer the question, do you necessarily think that when you are selling annuities prospectively into qualified plans with no guarantee that those sales are necessarily in trouble or not necessarily.","Dennis Glass","Well, so I understand the question. We sell very little non-guaranteed business into qualified plans. I don\u2019t know what the number is, but it\u2019s very small. Actually some of our corporate viewers even restrict that concept. Is that\u2026","Eric Berg","Yes, you\u2019ve answered and so is it you basic idea that because of the guarantee and the value associated with the guarantee that you may be able to - that the sales - is the point plainly and simply that because of the guarantee and the associated value of the guarantee that the sales, you may be able to sell these products under the new regime?","Dennis Glass","Absolutely and as I said just to add to that, several distributors have already said that they\u2019ll continue to sell VAs with living benefits on a commission basis with - if the rules don\u2019t change at all and that\u2019s because we\u2019re trying to get the value of the guarantee to the customers.","Eric Berg","And if I could ask one follow up regarding your investment portfolio, I think I know we moved - the numbers have moved around a little bit in the course of this call. But I think that you said that at the end of the September quarter the unrealized loss on your energy portfolio was $500 million give or take and as the below investment grade loss was much less than that. If I have that right, the basic concept right of what you\u2019re saying, that would suggest an out sized loss on your investment grade energy portfolio, something that surprises and you\u2019ve seen so many of your competitors, the investment grade energy portfolio is basically trading at book. My question, why would you have a large unrealized loss on your investment grade energy portfolio?","Dennis Glass","Yeah, that\u2019s going to be industry by industry and credit by credit analysis Eric and I don\u2019t know what the other - the mix of the other competitors is.","Eric Berg","Okay, I\u2019ll follow up with Chris and we can talk about it. Thanks, very much.","Operator","At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni for any closing remarks.","Chris Giovanni","Yes, thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning. As always we will take your questions on our investor relations line at 800-237-2920 or via email at investorrelations@lfg.com. Thank you all for joining and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Jim Sjoreen. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, operator. And good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's First Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about liquidity and capital resources, premiums, deposits, expenses and income from operations are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties are described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday and our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website, www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement, which include a full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including income from operations and return on equity, to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Operating earnings per share was up over the prior quarter, but operating earnings were down due to high mortality in Group Protection and Individual Life and low alternate investment earnings. These will be covered in more detail in a moment.","Looking through to the drivers of long-term earnings improvement, we had a very strong quarter, including account value growth in every business with total account values at a record $186 billion. Sales results up in every business segment after solid price increases in our Group, Individual Life and Annuity businesses. Expense management producing no increases year-over-year, reflecting actions taken throughout last year and the repurchase of $100 million of our shares. Reflecting these results, we ended the quarter with operating revenue growth of 4% and book value per share growth of 14%.","Let me now share highlights from our underlying segments starting with Individual Life. First quarter sales in Individual Life of $150 million increased 23% from the prior year, as we maintained our pivot toward product solutions that achieved higher returns in a low-rate environment. Guaranteed UL sales were down 26% from a year ago and now represent only 18% of total Life sales. Sales of our Pivot products, which include Variable Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life and term insurance, were up 82% from the same quarter last year. They also now comprise more than half of our total life sales, closing the quarter at 51%. Crossing the 50% threshold is significant for us and serves as an excellent example of our ability to successfully deliver on the Pivot strategy we have discussed with you in the past. We remain focused on improving and expanding our product line as evidenced in the first quarter by the successful launch of our new Treasury Indexed Universal Life product. Launching this offering bolsters our already strong portfolio of solutions and affirms our position as an industry leader focused on bringing innovation to the marketplace. We will keep reshaping and repricing products with changes in the second quarter planned for Guaranteed UL products and MoneyGuard. Underpinning it all remains the depth and proficiency of our distribution teams, which enable us to keep driving the right mix of sales.","Turning to our Annuity business. Strong equity markets and positive net flows advanced ongoing growth in account values that collectively contributed to a very positive result in the first quarter. Annuity sales of $3.2 billion drove positive net flows of $885 million, up from $293 million in net flows a year ago. On the product side, our risk-managed funds strategies remain an effective way to embed volatility management inside client accounts and reduce hedging costs. Of the $2.9 billion in sales of variable annuity, gross profits in the quarter, 78% of the deposits included a guaranteed living benefit rider built on our risk-managed fund strategies. And 9% of the deposits had no living benefit guarantees at all.","In the second quarter, we will expand our risk-managed fund strategies further. Also, we continue to improve VA margins. Importantly, we are reducing income benefits on the bulk of our joint survivorship living benefit riders. These riders comprised roughly half of all the guaranteed living benefit rider elections in the first quarter. This action is likely to flow sales for the balance of the year, though second quarter will be somewhat elevated as product changes are implemented.","We remain comfortable with our approach to the Annuity business and we will maintain our consistent presence in this space. Our focus remains not on taking market share with low-price offerings, but on selling solutions valuable to our customers that help Lincoln achieve good returns and manageable risks.","In Group Protection, the first quarter sales of $71 million increased 6% from the prior year. We remain focused on voluntary market where we grew sales by 61%. Looking back to 2012 and the most recent market data, we saw consistent market share and rankings year-over-year, and we finished in the top 5 to the life -- Life and Disability product lines by case count. Our field force grew by 13% from the prior year end as we continue to invest in the group business to support the 3,400 brokers who currently sell our products. With this growth and this group of brokers, we expect to grow sales.","In line with what we have shared on the last few calls, we expect nice pricing to firm in the market, particularly in the disability line where we have seen some positive progress over the last few quarters. Given the market-wide focus on profitability in the group space, we will remain diligent in our focus on overall profitability of new sales and renewal actions and our expectation is that all of the steps we are taking in this business will generate profitable growth.","In Retirement Plan Services, it was another excellent quarter for all leading indicators, highlighted by strong total deposits, solid retention and positive net flows. First quarter deposits of $1.7 billion were up 10% from a year ago, driven largely by advances in our mid- to large-market business. Our sales pipeline is strong and continues to grow. The successful completion of our new recordkeeping platform in the mid\/large market has directly helped us further penetrate the consultant and advisor communities. In fact, consultant firms who previously did not place business with Lincoln now account for 50% of our active sales pipeline in the mid to large market. This has resulted in significant new sales over the past 2 years.","Net flows for the first quarter were $344 million, up 62% from a year ago. Strong inflows combined with no large terminations contributed to our seventh straight quarter of positive flows. It is clear to us that our investments in RPS are paying off and we will keep investing in this business to increase our competitiveness, market presence and overall growth.","Turning to distribution. As we've said, one of Lincoln's primary strength is the size and scale of its distribution franchise. Collectively, our retail, wholesale and worksite sales teams reach annually more than 65,000 active producers. Producers who sell one of our products. And the number of advisors recommending our solutions in the first quarter increased by approximately 25% from a year ago. This is a tangible example of how strong -- how our strong franchise enables us to move forward key strategies, including: the Pivot in Individual Life, where we had a 52% increase from a year ago and the number of advisors recommending our life Pivot products; the Pivot in Annuities to our risk-managed fund strategies; accelerated growth in sales and net flows in RPS; and a push to stronger voluntary sales in Group Protection.","As I've said in the past, we will continue to build our strategic investments in distribution with an eye on expanding an already deep and powerful resource that includes 8,350 advisors affiliated through LFN, approximately 600 wholesalers in LFD and approximately 550 representatives within our worksite teams.","Spending a minute on investment management. Our net realized gain in our investment portfolio was $8.7 billion or 11.6% of assets. We maintained a strong level of net unrealized gains, the amount reflecting the long duration of our invested assets, which is driven by our disciplined asset liability management practices. With low investment yields persisting, we continue to incrementally invest new money in high-quality and well-diversified asset classes, such as private placements, commercial mortgage loans and middle-market loans.","During the first quarter, we invested more than $700 million in these asset classes with an average yield in excess of 4%, more than a 200-basis-point spread over the average tenure treasury during the quarter. Our private equity book experienced lower-than-expected investment performance this quarter after a very strong 2011 and 2012. We do expect quarterly earnings volatility from our alternatives portfolio. It has, over the last 2 years, generated strong returns and we would expect good results in the future.","Let me close my comments with you today by saying once again that although we experienced fluctuations in the quarter that affected earnings, the underlying drivers of long-term earnings and ROE growth were very strong. Moving forward, we'll keep taking aggressive steps that help us to increase revenue and improve profitability. In 2013, expense management, product repricing to drive new product returns and active capital management are important priorities.","With that, let me now turn things over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $285 million or $1.02 per share for the first quarter, up 3% from the first quarter of 2012. Overall, it was a solid quarter with earnings negatively impacted by few items of note, including $8 million in expenses that were recorded in the Other Operations segment. Adjusting for these expenses, I put normalized operating EPS at $1.05 per share. In addition, we experienced $19 million of elevated mortality spread across both the Individual and Group Life segments, and $6 million from lower-than-expected income on alternative investments. I've chosen not to characterize the mortality and investment income experience as one-time in nature due to the fact that both of these items will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but felt that the deviation from our long-term expectations were large enough that they should be noted.","Return on equity came in at 10.2% as it was negatively impacted by the earnings negatives I detailed a little earlier, while book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased by 14% to $42 for the year-ago quarter. Operating revenue increased 4% for the quarter and expenses were flat with the prior year. Net income of $239 million came in below operating income primarily due to the nonperformance-risk component associated with our variable annuity GLB reserves. This component moves the credit spreads and is not hedged. Net realized losses, on the other hand, were minimal at just $4 million.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $159 million, while ROE came in at 21%. Operating revenues increased 6% from the first quarter of 2012, primarily on higher fees driven by an 11% increase in average account values. Interest spreads remain steady as we continue to be in a position to manage in-force annuity spreads. Results specific to our VA guaranteed riders reflect both the quality of our book of business and hedge programs, as the net amount of risk associated with our living and death benefits continued to decline to $450 million, in the case of living benefits, and $1.1 billion for death benefits, both measures right around 1% of associated account value; while the hedge program had another good quarter with breakeven hedge performance and hedge assets $840 million in excess of guarantee liabilities.","Across all metrics, this was another very strong quarter for the Annuity segment. Of note, account values exceeded $100 billion at the end of the quarter, a record level for this important measure.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $35 million, which included $2 million of excess investment income. Quarter-over-quarter revenue growth of 3% benefited from an 8% increase in insurance fees, the result of an 11% increase in average account values. Market appreciation, strong deposits and net flows again contributed to the growth in assets under management, which ended the quarter at $46 billion, an all-time record level for this key driver of growth. Interest spread of 1.98% was down 19 basis points from the first quarter of 2012, roughly in line with our expectations for 20 to 25 basis points of annual spread compression for the Retirement business. Normalized ROA remained at 29 basis points on a sequential basis, in line with our expectations for 20 to -- 20 -- 25 to 30 basis points.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment, earnings of $112 million were down as a result of the fluctuations in mortality and alternative investment income. These 2 items reduced Life earnings by $20 million for the quarter, with $12 million of the impact coming from mortality. The quarter's mortality experience was driven by a few large claims, primarily in our term insurance book of business. To provide some context, our actual-to-expected mortality experience for 2010, 2011 and 2012 was 79%, 79% and 78%, respectively, while this quarter came in at 86%. While we will have outlier mortality quarters, both good and bad, I expect that when viewed in the context of a longer period, such as a calendar year, that we will return to levels more in line with that experience in the last 3 years.","Turning quickly to the Life earnings drivers. Average account balances were up 6% and Life Insurance in force up 2%, consistent with recent performance. Reported interest spreads were down on the weakness of the alternative investment portfolio. On a normalized basis, spreads came in around 185 basis points, down 13 basis points from the prior year and in line with our expectations for 10 to 15 points of annual spread compression.","Group Protection earned $14 million in the first quarter, with mortality negatively impacting the quarter's results by roughly $7 million. The mortality results for the quarter, which are similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2012, were driven by seasonality and fluctuations that will occur from time to time. As I mentioned with the Life segment, when viewed over a longer period, we expect a return to more normal experience.","Loss ratios in the disability business recovered nicely on improved recovery rates and stable incidents. It's premature to extrapolate these results to the rest of the year as incidents can trend higher and recoveries moderate. However, both metrics show well against the respective 5-year averages, which is a positive development.","Investments in distribution continue to drive stronger premium growth, which came in at 10% for the first quarter. We did reduce the discount rate on new claim incurrals by 50 basis points to 3.75%, which decreased earnings by $1.4 million, and increased the nonmedical loss ratio by approximately 0.5 percentage points.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few items of note. We continued with our disciplined capital management strategy during the first quarter repurchasing 3.4 million shares at a cost of $100 million. Cash at the holding company came in at $647 million and statutory capital ended the quarter in excess of $7.5 billion, so RBC was approximately 480, both measures down slightly from their year-end levels. While Guaranteed UL sales were relatively modest in the quarter, it did generate some capital strain driven by the new reserving requirement that went into effect at the beginning of the year. We expect that we will be able to largely reverse this strain with the reserve financing transactions later in the year.","While as I noted, earnings were negatively impacted by a few items this quarter, we are very encouraged by the continuing strong performance that we see in key growth and operating metrics, including: strong earnings driver growth, with both average account values and group premiums up 10%; good expense management with G&A flat year-over-year; excellent sales and deposit growth, as noted by Dennis; continuing price increases across the portfolio; and a strong capital position that allows for continuing share repurchases.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, guys. First on the mortality, which I guess we'll probably get a lot. The term was just a few -- on the term side, it was just a few large claims. On the group side, did -- was there any commonality between what was going on types of accounts, distributors, anything like that, that might indicate something else than just a random fluctuation?","Randal J. Freitag","Now, Steven, this is Randy. We've looked across the entire book. And it was, I'd say, of the excess mortality, about 1\/3 of it was probably seasonality. We typically see a little higher claims in the first quarter, and the other 2\/3 is really spread across the entire book. Once again, to provide a little context around group mortality, if you look over the last 3 calendar years, the mortality rate is incredibly stable, it varies less than 1% year-to-year. Looking at the first quarter, we're roughly 10% above that level with about 1\/3 about attributable to seasonality, like I said. So I fully expect that if you look forward and you look over a longer period, like a calendar year, that will return to the type of experience that we've had year after year after year.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the corporate side, you noted $8 million of after tax expense there that you thought was nonrecurring. That would drive, if you were to take a look at that, that would drive that commission other expense line to certainly lows over the last 5 quarters, maybe even longer. Would that be a sustainable run rate going forward, Randy?","Randal J. Freitag","I think that we had very good expense management across the company. Now, typically, when you look at expenses historically, you'll see they trend up somewhat over the course of the year as projects get rolling and production typically moves up over the course of the year. But I'd note that I fully expect that account values, and premiums and face amount in force also grow over the course of the year to cover that sort of the expense growth. So I think it just reflects very solid expense management. I wouldn't be surprised to see expenses trend up a little bit over the course of the year. But I expect revenues will continue to grow also.","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question just on -- you mentioned limiting sales of secondary guarantee UL, just how comfortable are you with the business that you have sold over the past couple of years given the rate environment and just given the reserving requirements? And then secondly, on the dental business, the loss ratio seemed high even x seasonality. So wondering if you could actually just discuss what drove that?","Dennis R. Glass","Let me speak to the first question about how comfortable we are with the guaranteed universal life sales that we've had over the past year. Each quarter, we have been reporting that the expected new business returns on those products were in the 9%, maybe the 10% collective when you add all sales up together. And that those have been 1% or 2% lower targets. But the fact of the matter is, it's a very difficult environment. We continue to increase our pricing, as I've mentioned. We're going to do it again pretty significantly in the first -- in the second quarter. So the answer is, we're getting 10% on new business sales, our surplus is earning 3% or 4%. We continue to improve pricing. So yes, we're pretty comfortable with the sales that we've made. But we're going to continue to improve the pricing and be very careful about the mix of sales as we go forward. I can't be more proud of the execution around this Pivot strategy that we have mentioned this quarter and before. Randy, do you have something on the dental?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Jimmy, you typically see seasonality in the dental loss ratio. It's a calendar year benefit and so you see the loss ratio is a little higher at the beginning of the year as people use up their benefit and it trends down as people run out of benefit later in the year. I don't think there was anything in the dental loss ratio outside of that typical seasonality.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But it seems like it was been higher than it's been typically in the first quarter, that's the reason I was asking. So normally it does pick up, but it picked up a little bit more?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, Jimmy. I think it was well within our expectations for the first quarter.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then maybe I'll ask another one on share buybacks. Last year, you bought back a lot more in the first half than you did in the second half. Should we assume a similar pattern this year on -- because the buybacks were at least a little bit lower than what we had assumed?","Randal J. Freitag","Jimmy, as always, we guide to roughly $400 million of capital management in the course of the year. I fully expect that we're on track to do that again. As I say every time that I give this answer, we always strive to overachieve and I don't expect any different this year. We're going to be working hard to get things like reserve financings done. I mentioned that we'll reverse the strain we experienced on the Guaranteed UL in the first quarter, I believe, with financing transactions. So I'm very comfortable with the way we're using our capital to do things like share buybacks, and I think we'll continue as the opportunity arises.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Randy, I just wanted to follow up on Jimmy's last question on the share repurchase. Interested in your comment about wanting to overachieve again this year, like I think what you did last year. If you did do more than the $400 million, should we be thinking about higher level of reserve financings being the primary driver there? Or is there something else that you're thinking about that could influence the pace of buyback?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I think if you look back to the last couple of years, it's been a combination of strong reserve financing, a couple of years ago. And then last year, just leveraging a bit of our strong capital position. We remain very well-capitalized, a very strong capital position. So I think it's going to be a combination of all of those things if we're able to. Once again, my guidance is for $400 million. We're always trying to overachieve on everything we do.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And then, can you just talk a little bit about the reserve financing market? I mean, you said that you're going to trying to reverse some of the strain that you experienced in the first quarter and, I guess, how likely is it? And then from a timing perspective, when would you expect to pull the trigger on something?","Randal J. Freitag","The reserve financing marketplace from the suppliers is as strong as it's ever been. It's as if -- I think the only caution I put out there is that we continue to work with the NAIC captives. I believe that at the end of the day, we'll end up with capital solution -- captive solution that is in alignment with how we have historically used captives, but that's the one caution I'll note there, I'd say.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just another one on the Group Protection business. I think in your prepared comments, you talked about the voluntary business being up. At Unum's last call, called the last hour, they talked about some pricing challenges in that business, perhaps some competition, some impact from health insurance reform, health care reform. So I guess I'm just curious in terms of what's driving your growth? Is it new plans that you're adding, or increased business with existing accounts? It seems like you're seeing a little bit of a different trend than, perhaps, they were guiding to in terms of the first quarter.","Dennis R. Glass","That's a good question. I think Unum is -- well, I shouldn't say I think Unum -- Unum dominates the market and they have a very large market share. I think the dynamics for them are a little bit different than they are for us because we have a smaller share, and so our percentage increases don't require as many dollars of new sales, frankly. But it's a combination of a couple of things. One, as you heard me say, our sales force is up 13%, I didn't mention it again this year, but -- this quarter, but last quarter, we talked about that sales force being able to reach a lot of new brokers. And so it's driven in part by the increase in our sales force. Also, it just so happens this quarter that we had 1 or 2 larger cases than we'd typically get on the voluntary side. And so that helped with the increase. Insofar as pricing is concerned, at least relative to True Group, we continue to get better ROEs on our voluntary business. So that's better business for us from a profitability standpoint. So we're going to continue to try. I -- the 61% increase that we saw in voluntary, I don't expect that percentage increase to continue through the course of the year, but it was a good year -- a good first quarter. I'm proud of it. It's good business.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just one last one on the mortality, just so I understand the messaging, Randy. So when you said the 1\/3, 2\/3, was that just for the group insurance business or did that include the individual life? And then, I guess, as we think about getting back to that -- those mortality -- actually the expected numbers that you were talking about, should we assume that you'd probably get the back the 1\/3 from the seasonality maybe as soon as the second quarter, but that the other 2\/3 might take a couple of quarters before that comes back? Or just wondering, how that's going to trend as we move forward through the year?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. I mean, seasonality and mortality are a little higher. Mortality in the first quarter is pretty typical across -- we've seen is pretty typical across all of our businesses. And specifically, I spiked out the third in the group business. It's is a little more volatile in the individual business, I'd say. Now as for the timing of getting back, that I don't know. I think, once again, on the life side, at the end the day, our A to E is incredibly steady year after year after year on a calendar basis. There's nothing in the mortality that leads me to expect that we should expect any different going forward. As to the timing of when it comes back, I can't talk about that.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Bass of Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had a question and VAs. I just wanted to get your perspective. I guess, the pricing has gone up significantly over the past years and features have become less generous, but still seems like we're seeing strong consumer demand for the product. Just wondering if you have any sense from your discussions with customers or through your distribution as to kind of how much more the industry can reduce feature generosity before customers kind of won't buy the product? I'd just be interested on your thoughts on that.","Dennis R. Glass","That's a great question. We give it a lot of thought around here. What I look at the Lincoln fact situation, we've increased pricing pretty significantly either through reducing the benefit levels or from actually increasing the charge on our riders. Collectively, we've done that over the last couple of years. We've -- sort of separate from the consumer, we've decreased commissions, we've also recently restricted add-on payments. So there's quite a bit that we've done. And I think, as you've pointed out, others have done the same thing, yet we continue to see good demand from consumers. So I don't think we've yet reached the point where the price changes the industry has been making is at a the point where consumers don't think VA is still a good product for them for part of their portfolio. How much further we can do, we can go, I think we'll just have to see. It's a combination of not just VA, but what other alternative investment opportunities are available to consumer. But so far so good. And again, at Lincoln, we're producing 20% ROEs on a consistent basis. You heard Randy talk about the hedge fund performance, and Standard & Poor's and Moody's both publicly say that Lincoln's hedge performance -- excuse me, hedge strategy and risk management is singularly the best in the industry. So we'll make adjustments as we can. It's good business and, in the right amount, we're quite happy with it.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got you. And to follow up on that last point, when you say the right amount, how do you think about that? And I guess, if we are in a scenario where pricing alone is not kind of enough to dictate demand, then would you consider actions on the kind of the distribution side that, I don't know, if need be, to kind of manage the sales volume?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, let me put my comment of the right amount into perspective a little bit. I think because we aggregate fixed annuity earnings with variable annuity earnings that we leave the impression that variable earnings -- maybe we leave the impression that variable annuity earnings are a larger portion of total earnings than they actually are. If you add up business segment earnings, and by that, I mean, if you add up the Group business, the Life Insurance business, the RPS business and the individual Annuity business, variable annuity earnings are about 36%, so a little more than 1\/3 of the total of those -- of that aggregate. So it's probably lower than what you all think. I am not uncomfortable with that level as we move forward with our program. Again, we want to see growth, but we're not looking for 15% to 20% growth year-over-year. And how much we will do is a function of earnings mix, it's a function of, frankly, the multiple applied to that by the market over time, and I think that's going to get better rather than worse. We have to look at the potential calls on capital from the size of the book that we have. But right now, we're in very good shape. I think Randy mentioned, just throwing another fact in here, that the living benefit reserves and the mortality reserves are only 1% of our -- not the reserves, but the net amount of risk is 1% of our account values. So 1% of our account values, excellent risk management continue to change pricing. And let me just comment -- and then I'm on running on here a little bit, but in May, we're going to reduce by 50 to 100 basis points the payouts on the benefit on our joint survivorship business, which represented about 50% of the business that we had in the first quarter of 2013. So again in the second half, because of that pretty substantial benefit change, we expect sales to be tempered from what they otherwise might be in the second half.","Randal J. Freitag","Eric, just let me add a little bit to that. I'd say that part of the reason they've come up -- the earnings are about 36%, is because the equity markets have performed so darned well. And I'd definitely put that in the camp of a high quality problem.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Finkelstein of Evercore Partners.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Randy, I think you alluded to it a little bit. But -- maybe you or Dennis, can you just give us an update on where we are in the captive discussions? You guys are clearly involved in discussions that we don't see.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. First of all, the starting point, if I can compare it to AG38, is much different, because the starting point on AG38 was both a prospective and retrospective application of the new -- whatever the new reserving practice or rules would be, and ended up being just mostly a prospective thing, some cash flow testing retrospectively. And I do think in aggregate, the industry really had to change its historical reserves in total by much, if any. With respect to captives, I think we're pretty much starting from prospective that a lot of good captives have been put in place. There might be 1 or 2 things that the regulators are concerned about in some of the structures. But that, by and large, both the industry and the regulators are looking at this more on a prospective basis. And the discussions are ongoing. Lincoln, along with other companies in the industry, are engaging directly with the NAIC leadership. And I expect a similar good outcome on this as to what we saw jointly between the regulators and the industry on AG38. What we're looking for, both of us, in the industry and the regulators, are -- want the captives to be strong. We want -- we have a focus on solvency when we do these things at Lincoln, making sure that they're substantive, they're real, there's risk transfer. And I think the regulators, once they are satisfied with some of the more sound structures and they can get some comparability and some understanding, transparency, that it will work out. But it's in its early stages and it will take a while to work through.","A.  Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I guess just on the life changes. You talked about kind of putting through some rate increases in SGUL and, I think, MoneyGuard as well. I mean, how meaningful are the increases that you're making and how do we think about kind of sales levels of those 2 products going forward?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Well, first, sometime in the first quarter, we restricted single pay premiums completely -- not completely, but significantly, while we are repricing the products. On single rate product or short pay products, single pay or short pay products, we're looking at some pretty substantial increases and premium, 16% to 30%, so those are big changes. But with the new reserving requirements and the low interest rates, that's what it takes to get these returned. On MoneyGuard, sort of 2 things that we're trying to do. One is move more of the business to flexible pay, which has the better return pattern. And then, we're also increasing the premium requirement on the single pay by 5%. We're eliminating some single pay -- we're eliminating single pay for ages over 70. So we're doing quite a bit, more at the margin. But the 5% is a pretty big increase in the movement to the flexible pay versus single pay is important as well. So it\u2019s pretty significant movement on that. And just as you've been listening to me speak, we're -- last year and this year, we're talking about strong price increases across all of our product lines. You hear us talk about 5% -- excuse me, middle and single digits to upper single digits. In the life side, 15% and 20%. So we're going at it aggressively. And we still, as you saw it, had pretty good sales results across all of our lines. So we're feeling good about it.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a question in terms of the sort of response from the distribution and that's the major point, I mean, guys are putting through aggressive price increases. The industry is doing that broadly. I mean, sort of how are they responding as they look for products to sell?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, let's talk about how this works at Lincoln and then we'll talk about how it might be received by our distribution partners. So at Lincoln, any decision about product changes or price increases is a collaborative decision between our distribution organization and our manufacturing organization. But that's still very important because as you get to the end seller of the product, the financial advisor at Merrill Lynch or the financial advisor at Morgan Stanley, we have to make sure that the changes that we're making, either in the design of the product or the pricing of the product is going to meet with their needs. And so everything we do takes significant input from not only internal distribution people, but discussions with our distribution partners outside. So my answer is that we don't do anything that we don't think is a good balance between what the distribution organizations need -- again, our partners, the 67,000 different individuals that sell our product lines, and what we need to get decent returns for our shareholders.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the product changes that you're making on the VA, Randy, can you comment maybe just how much you're boosting, sort of, ROEs or IRRs are you getting on the new product versus the similar old product or comparable old product?","Randal J. Freitag","Could you ask that again, please?","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, just in terms of the ROEs or IRRs that you guys are measuring for the product that you're going to be focusing on now in terms of the VA sales changes, the changes you're making versus what you sold maybe just a quarter or 2 ago?","Randal J. Freitag","The change in the ROEs?","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, please.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Generally, we're going up 1% to 2% on the internal rates of return across the board. That's sort of what the objective is on some of the different products.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just following up, Dennis, on the last call, you made the comment around smart money kind of, looking into the VA space. Curious if you can provide any more thoughts or insight in terms of what you're hearing or seeing on that front over the past 3 months or so?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, there was the flurry of activities that was -- that were done by the private equity firms, I guess, predominantly Apollo and Guggenheim. Everything we hear is that there is -- because they've been so successful and the profitability on what they have done has been high, that there's other product private equity firms that are out looking for similar opportunities. So I think private equity in the fixed and variable annuity business will be a growing phenomenon over time, and hopefully a positive impact on the business in general.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just -- would that be your view? I mean, I guess, you sit on a lot of boards and represented the industry, I mean, I think, there are some concerns that people have on increased risk on the asset side, maybe putting companies or the industry at risk. I mean, is that something that you would be focused or worried on, or not as much at this point in time?","Dennis R. Glass","That's a question that I think we have to see how it evolves. Anecdotally, what we've seen is that the private equity firms are barbelling, and so that in their portfolio, they're putting more private equity in which would be a higher risk, more volatile asset. But they're compensating for that by limiting the rest of the portfolio, at least in the cases I've seen, to more like NAIC 1-type investments. And in some instances, the actual C3 risk, or the call for capital, in the portfolios they structure is less than what maybe a typical insurer would do. So that would lead you to believe that there is no more risk in what they're doing and what the average annuity portfolio is doing. Having said that, that's anecdotal, and we'll have to continue to watch as more private equity firms get into the market to see if there's a change in posture that would change my view on it.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher of Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, a follow-up question on the universal life product changes. The single-pay and short-pay SGUL that you referenced you were changing pricing on, what percent of sales would those represent, let's say, in 1Q or the quarter before that? Is that meaningful as a percent of overall sales?","Dennis R. Glass","Not since we've introduced the limits of the amount of single pay business that we let flow through the system. But we want to get out into the marketplace and have single and short pay that's profitable business. We want to have a complete portfolio of business. And so it still would represent a small portion of what we do, is my expectation, but we'd have a product that meets our total returns.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Dennis, I guess, my question -- I just wanted to try and get the context of that change. If you're not selling much of it, by changing pricing, presumably, it'll go close to 0. I just want to understand what's going on behind the scenes? Why flag this if it's not really moving the needle in terms of sales volumes to begin with?","Dennis R. Glass","AG38 came out -- and again, I'm just going to repeat what I said. It's important for us, for our distribution partners, to have a complete suite of products. And right now, our old single-pay, short-pay product is way underpriced for the type of returns that we want to achieve. So as a stopgap measure, and something that we don't like to do, we've essentially limited the amount of business that come in on that basis. So the next step is to get back into the market even though it's a small piece of what we'll be selling, but we'll have a product that's a good product for the consumer, it's -- it has acceptable returns, even with the new AG38 reserving requirements. And again, we'll build out the product suite. And that's important, because people don't come to us for a single product, they come to us for a suite of products. And so we want that full suite of products that strengthens the relationship with our distributors or our end distributors.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. So the reason the sales volume is low is because you're just limiting the amount. But you don't like the profitability as per new AG38 requirements, so you had to get it to acceptable levels even on even on that limited amount. That's the way I should be thinking about it?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. I think, that's a good summary.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. The -- and Randy, just to go back to the actual to expected, I just want to understand that I fully get the message here. The 78% to 79% a year seems like a very good result. And this quarter's 86% was worse, but still, certainly, doesn't sound bad in the grand scheme of things. So you'd said 2 things. One was, that if you looked at it versus a year ago in the 1Q '12, it was fairly similar. I think I got that right, that's what you said. I just want to make sure that's what you said. And then I want to understand, should we take these numbers to mean, even if they do drift up to the mid-80s actual to expected, that would still be pretty favorable relative to reserving levels, even if the absolute earnings we're going to see is going to be low? Sorry for the long-winded question, but I just want to try and get -- better understand this.","Randal J. Freitag","Sure. On the first part, I think you were mixing the 2 businesses. I think, I said group was similar to last year and the percentages you were referring to were the numbers I gave for the individual business. So on the individual side, we were higher than we were last year on a -- from a mortality standpoint. As to the second part, the mortality that we assume in our GAAP models and in our recipe reserves, that is -- reflects our experience as a company. And I don't see any threat to those assumptions inside of those models as we sit here today. So I have no reason to expect that the assumptions we are using in our models need to change at all because we had one quarter of bad experience. As to our -- your -- just the theme of your -- that your last question, about mortality drifting up to 85%, that just is not something I would ever expect to happen. I mean, 99.9% of the people that were with us for the last 3 years are the same people that are part of our mortality experience today, and those people haven't suddenly decided to die at a 10% faster rate. I mean, experience is going to be what it has been in mortality and it doesn't change at a very fast rate.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, Randy, just following up on that. In 3Q of this past year, you did make some, I think, it was assumptions to your DAC model, which released some of the conservatism on the mortality side, I believe. Is that too small to move the needle or is that -- is it possible we're starting to see some of that flow through?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I don't expect that we experience this quarter will have really any impact on the assumptions in our model, so I don't really see a threat from what happened this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I had a question on alternatives. Just because I'm so curious by the results this quarter. I mean, I think Lincoln is the first and the only company that I've seen so far this quarter across, frankly, all of insurance that is seeing alternatives investment income coming below expectations. Is there something specific, a specific fund or something like that, that might have driven that?","Dennis R. Glass","That is a great question. We're -- you expect the performance of at least the private equity to follow the stock market in some fashion. Let me just give you some statistics that might help to put this into perspective. Our total vaults [ph] -- total portfolio is $841 million at the end of 2012. We're taking that up to $1.1 billion by the end of 2013. And during -- in 2012, that portfolio earned $125 million. In 2011, it earned $90 million. But when I look back over the last 24 months -- I'll just pick out some points for you. In December, we had negative $2 million, in December of '11. In March, we had positive $42.5 million. So year-over-year, we've had pretty consistent total earnings. But in any one quarter, we've seen swings as high as $45 million quarter-to-quarter. So my guess is this is just one of those quarters where you just have a bad result and there's no systemic reason for it.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so this -- it's helpful. I was going to ask you, so you already sort of answered with how much you expect to take this portfolio size up through this year. So we should expect as the size of the portfolio grows, I suspect your return expectations will be similar, is that a fair to assume? So a normal level of alternatives investment income should grow with the size of the portfolio?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. The only caution I would give you there is the same J-curve concept in private equity, which is -- particularly on brand new investments, it takes 2 years, 3 years or 4 years before you begin to see earnings developments. And so we try to balance sort of the richness of -- or the age of the portfolio and not overload it with too much new stuff because that would drive down in the short run the earnings.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then Dennis, I got a question for you just on the variable Annuity business and market share. I think you've said in the past that Lincoln has been very steadily over some lengthy period of time about the #7 player in the VA market. But in short term periods of time, I suppose, that can move higher or lower. My guess is it's moved higher here recently with your 35% year-over-year VA sales growth much faster than what we've seen from at least the publicly traded peer group. So I guess my question is this long-winded way of asking it, but what level of market position are you comfortable with? Are you comfortable with moving into the top 5? If more of those who are currently there continue to pull back as much as they seem to be doing?","Dennis R. Glass","If I might just correct the market position, I don't know, maybe you put more people into that bucket than we do. But we have been fifth for 5 years. And we're putting the IRB slides together and we have a very powerful slide in there that in terms of quarterly fluctuations in sales that over the last 5 years -- and when you see this, you'll see that our quarterly fluctuations have been extremely modest relative to the industry and that's because we've never chased market share by having a low-priced product. So again, the way we run the business, we're comfortable. We'd rather tamp down sales. Again, we're not looking for 30%, 35% sales increases this year. We can't turn on $0.10 because we don't like to take product off the shelf, we don't think that's a good strategy, vis-a-vis, our partners, our distribution partners. And so we have to do with pricing changes. And sometimes it just takes a little longer for us to get a pricing change. I mean, it takes 3, 4, 5 months to properly redesign and get the product approved. But this May change that we're making is consistent with our strategy. We've see our volumes get a little bit higher than we'd like them to see. We have opportunity to improve returns even above already high returns that we're getting, and expect sales to slow over the second half of the year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions]","Now, I would like to turn the conference over to the Corporate Treasurer, Chris Giovanni. Please go ahead sir.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Kathryn. Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases, liquidity, and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. These risks and uncertainties include those described in the cautionary statement disclosures in our earnings release issued yesterday, as well as those detailed in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, most recently most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and from time-to-time in our other filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them to reflect events or circumstances that occur after this date.","We appreciate your participation today and invite you to visit Lincoln's website www.lincolnfinancial.com, where you can find our press release and statistical supplement which include a full reconciliation to the non-GAAP measures used in the call, including adjusted return on equity and adjusted income from operations or adjusted operating income to their most comparable GAAP measures.","Presenting on today's call are Dennis Glass, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randy Freitag, Chief Financial Officer and Head of Individual Life. After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone. Third quarter earnings were disappointing, but I am confident that our strategies and management actions are driving and are going to continue to drive earnings growth. I also want to emphasize that our franchise and business model have the strength to deal with low interest rates, a headwind, facing us and the industry.","First, on the quarter's negative operating earnings results there were three primary impacts. Number one, our annual review included a significant charge with a component related to interest rates. While our interest rate assumptions were already more conservative than most competitors, we still followed a rigorous process and made appropriate changes.","Number two, alternatives meaningfully underperformed as we wrote down a large private equity holding. This is an investment we've owned for many years. The third impact was quarterly fluctuations we see from time to time. Randy will cover each of these in more detail shortly.","Turning to the ongoing strength of the franchise, we continue to benefit from actions taken by management to accelerate growth, diversify sales, achieve appropriate returns, and tactically tilt our sales mix towards shorter duration products which are less sensitive to interest rates. These actions helped drive double-digit sales growth in annuities, life insurance, in group protection and along with the Liberty acquisition resulted in 84% of our total sales coming from products without long-term guarantees up 20 percentage points compared to five years ago.","We are also successfully executing on our digital program and diligently managing expenses which were down 3% compared to the prior year quarter. Net savings from our digital program should begin to ramp up next year and along with further Liberty integration savings provide a tailwind to earnings in the medium term.","Lastly, our diversified and attractive business mix enables us to consistently generate a significant amount of cash flow which we are both investing in growth and returning to shareholders. Our active share buyback program led to an 8% decrease in shares outstanding compared to the prior year and last night we announced an 8% increase in the quarterly common stock dividend.","Now turning to the business segments starting with Annuities. Our decision to broaden the product portfolio and participate in more segments of the market enabled us to meet different customer needs, sustain our growth and maintain a diversified sales mix even while we are adjusting pricing and product features in response to lower interest rates.","Total sales increased 12% compared to the prior year quarter and net flows were positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. Consistent with our strategy, we have shifted our sales mix as five years ago over 70% of our sales are variable annuities with living benefit guarantees compared to this quarter where sales were evenly balanced among VAs with living benefit guarantees, VAs with outliving benefit guarantees and fixed annuities.","Expanding shelf space and adding new producers resulted in significant momentum in indexed variable annuity sales. This led to a 54% increase in sales of BAs without living benefit guarantees which improves our long-term risk profile. We are also expanding shelf space and increasing wholesalers in fixed annuities which resulted in 15% sales growth including significant gains in independent marketing organizations where we launched customized products for two large distribution partners last year.","So another quarter of strong momentum for the Annuities business as growing metrics are clearly benefiting from our broad set of consumer solutions and our multichannel distribution model, where both client facing headcount and total producers are up 12% over the prior year quarter. When combined with disciplined pricing, appropriate assumptions, and an industry-leading hedge program, we are well positioned to deliver strong results even if consumer preferences and capital markets shift.","In Retirement Plan Services, our high touch, high-tech digitally focused model plays a competitive advantage in our target markets. This differentiated service model continues to improve the experience of both plan sponsors and employees driving higher participation and contribution rates and benefiting retention. As a result, recurring deposits increased 12% over the prior year quarter with double-digit growth in both the small and mid to large markets and net flows remain positive.","Total deposits decreased as the prior quarter benefited from a previously disclosed sale of $1 billion healthcare plan. The sales pipeline is strong as we enter the fourth quarter with YourPath, our proprietary alternative to target the funds and another great example of product innovation at Lincoln, which is a true differentiator in the marketplace.","Additionally, we've seen opportunity to expand YourPath adoption across our in-force block proving incremental growth. Overall, it was a solid quarter for retirement business highlighted by another quarter of [indiscernible] inflows and healthy bottom line growth.","Turning to Life Insurance, strategically we have and are repositioning the light portfolio towards products with both meet consumer needs drive profitable growth. In the quarter individual life sales increased 26% demonstrating the life business franchise strength by shifting and growing at the same time. Total sales grew 40% because we had a large executive benefits case in the quarter.","Our sales are benefiting from further penetrating the IUL market which is a large and fast-growing industry segment where we are taking market share. Term sales are growing as we make significant process improvements and adjust prices more agilely. We are also maintaining our leadership position in the VUL and hybrid markets.","The ability to grown and do product sales is in part accomplished through our industry leading distribution platform. Our client facing headcount is nearly 300 employees and up 8% over the prior year quarter. We are in every major life distribution channel and over the past two years over 66,000 independent producers have sold a Lincoln life insurance product.","This vast network of distribution partners has helped us position our sales mix. We are now two-thirds of our sales are not meaningfully effective by the level of interest rates. Our manufacturing capabilities have created diverse byproduct portfolio where no product represents more than 30% of total life sales and this broad based strength has enabled us to maintain aggregate returns above targets.","Nonetheless we are making additional pricing changes where needed to reflect low interest rates. While Life insurance earnings were most affected by our annual assumption review, the business remains well position moving forward with a proven record of disciplined growth and financial management which has enabled us to overcome headwinds facing the industry.","Turning to Group Protection, benefits from the Liberty acquisition and successful integration, will once again demonstrate at this quarter as sales were robust, premiums grew and after tax margins remained strong. Our national competitive environment has enabled us to effectively execute strategic objectives and maximize the competitive advantages created by the acquisition.","This includes leveraging our larger book of business and expanding capabilities to cross-sell additional lines of coverage and further penetrate the employee paid markets. These strategies contribute to 53% growth in sales compared to the prior quarter with employee paid sales increasing at a faster rate than employer paid.","The 5000+ market historical strength of Liberty is seeing growth reemerge as distribution partners gained confidence and our post integration service and execution, while the 1000 to 5000 mid-market segment is benefiting from the best of both companies. The group business had another strong quarter and we are optimistic that we will continue to achieve attractive margins.","Shifting to investment results, we invested new money into the pretax yield of 3.7%, 190 basis points over the average 10-year treasury. Additionally, as the credit cycle extends we have continued to focus on managing credit risk, more intensively, by derisking in sectors and securities that have greater risk of credit deterioration under a stress scenario and further diversifying the portfolio.","We have decreased our overall exposure to corporate credit, particularly in the energy and consumer cyclical sectors, while increasing our exposure to infrastructure, consumer non-cyclical and high quality loan-to-value commercial mortgage loans. The portfolio of credit quality is in great shape with below investment grade assets representing less than 4% of total assets and BBB minus rated securities decreasing by more than 100 basis points from prior year quarter.","As I noted up front we had a write-down of a large private equity holding. Our commitment to this single investment was $11 million and over the following five years the value increased $138 million, before being marked down this quarter to $24 million. Over this period the alternatives portfolio achieved a 9% pretax return including this write down.","I would note this particular investment was a uniquely concentrated position within an otherwise highly diversified private equipment portfolio, which includes 255 limited partnerships with an average size of less than $7 million and no other single investment with a carrying value greater than $36 million. Overall we continue to like construction and diversification of the alternatives portfolio and believe our long-term annual return target of 10% remains achievable.","Before closing, let me briefly comment on the current interest rate environment. As we have noted in the past, there are three areas of potential impacts from low rates. One, new business returns. Two, spread compression and three the balance sheet. First on new business returns. We have benefited from the actions mentioned earlier by selling more products without long-term guarantees and that are less impacted by low interest rates.","Nevertheless, we have been taking a proactive approach by reviewing all our product features and pricing to make sure we maintain a disciplined balance between customer value, growth, risk and returns. We are comfortable selling where we are today given our product mix combined with pricing actions we have taken or expect to take. We will continue to reprice when necessary to achieve appropriate returns on the capital we invest in growth.","Next on spread compression, previously we anticipated 2% to 3% headwind to EPS growth from interest rates and to see that debate over time. Given the current interest rate environment we expect to be at the upper end of that range as spread compression is persisting longer than we had originally anticipated. However, it is important to recognize that this level of spread compression is consistent with recent years and the benefit from our diverse business model has enabled us to grow EPS and generate a steady percentage of earnings from capital market sensitive businesses.","Third, on the balance sheet while the impact from unlocking was larger than usual this year, I would note that book value per share excluding AOCI still increased 5% compared to the prior year quarter and the charge was non-cash. We continue to expect minimal impacts on statutory capital from asset adequacy testing unless the 10-year treasury rate is persistently in the 1% range and even then we expect manageable impacts.","So while this quarter's results included significant negative impacts, we continue to successfully execute on key strategic initiatives that position Lincoln to sustain our track record of excellent financial performance and create long-term value for shareholders.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randy Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night we reported a third quarter adjusted operating loss of $46 million or $0.25 per share. As we noted in the earnings release, this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions resulted in a charge of $403 million or $2 per share. Included in this was $291 million from interest rates of which $139 million came from the impact of the significant drop in rates on the starting point.","Additionally, we lowered our long-term ultimate interest rate assumption to 3.5% and extended our gradient period to seven years, which resulted in a $152 million negative impact. Based on our review of industry surveys, we remain on the conservative side with respect to interest rate assumptions and continue to follow our normal process of prudently responding to changes in the capital markets and appropriately reflecting our experience across our assumptions.","Outside of interest rates there was a $112 million net unfavorable impact with mortality updates and higher reassurance cost coming in negative, partially offset by several adjustments, including modifications to policyholder behavior assumptions and other items. As part of this year's review we did not unlock to the coming quarter which still provides an approximate $135 million after-tax cushion against declines in the equity markets.","In addition to the significant impacts from the annual assumption review, there were a few other items that resulted in some large variability this quarter including negative returns in the alternatives portfolio primarily from the write-down Dennis mentioned, reduced adjusted operating earnings by $94 million or $0.47 per share relative to expectations. And quarterly fluctuations in individual life mortality relative to our annual expectations along with a higher group loss ratio reduced adjusted operating earnings by $42 million or $0.21 per share.","We are normalizing for unlocking alternatives and quarterly fluctuations and implies an EPS of approximately $2.40 and gives you a much better indication of our earnings power.","Moving to the performance of key financial metrics, we're normalizing for notable items and alternatives underperformance, strong sales, net flows and equity market strength resulted in all four businesses showing operating revenue growth over the prior year quarter. G&A expenses net of months capitalized decrease 3% year-over-year and when combined with revenue growth, the expense ratio improved 60 basis points.","Moving to the balance sheet, capital ratios are solid. We have significant cash at the holding company and strong capital generation is enabling us to both invest in growth and return capital to shareholders.","Before shifting to segment results, our net loss in the quarter was $161 million. This included a $33 million charge from an early tender for debt and acquisition and integration costs of $31 million. The hedge program performed well during a period of heightened market volatility, with $22 million of net losses and the general account performed well as credit losses were negligible.","Now turning to the second results starting with annuities, reported operating income for the quarter was $169 million which included a $93 million unfavorable impact from our annual review primarily related to interest rates. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, this quarter's alternatives underperformance of $10 million and our Marco [ph] reinsurance transaction earnings decreased slightly.","Return metrics excluding notable items and alternatives, underperformance remained strong with ROA at 81 basis points and a ROE of 22% average account values of $134 million increased 2% excluding the reentrance transaction driven by positive net flows and equity market gains. Risk metrics remained solid as net amount of risk sits just about 1% of a comp value for living benefits and 0.5% for debt benefits.","So annuities results were a bit noiser than usual this quarter, but underlying trends were solid as net flows remained positive and year-over-year earnings growth should reemerge following the year of a theme related impacts.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported operating income of $44 million up from $40 million in the prior year quarter driven by great expense management. Net flows totaled $272 million in the quarter which when combined with favorable equity markets and further organic growth drove average account values to $74 billion up 4%. A 3% decrease in G&A net of a month's capitalized combined with revenue growth resulted in a 100 basis point year-over-year improvement in the expense ratio.","Base spreads excluding veritable investment income compressed six basis points versus the prior year quarter and ROA came in at 24 basis points. The retirement business had a strong quarter with organic growth and expense discipline remaining key drivers going forward.","Turning to life insurance, the annual assumption review and this year's \u2013 and this quarter's alternatives underperformance have the greatest impact on the life business as we reported an operating loss of $245 million. In total, the net assumption changes reduced operating earnings by $320 million including $225 million from interest rates. As noted earlier, there were several other unlocking adjustments that had a net unfavorable impact of $95 million in the life segment.","Additionally, $69 million of alternative investment underperformance impacted the life business. Adjusting for notable items and this quarter's alternatives underperformance our operating earnings were $144 million compared to $196 million in the prior year quarter. The decline was related to $29 million in unfavorable mortality relative to our annual expectations in the current quarter compared to $22 million of favorable mortality in the prior year quarter.","Underlying drivers were solid with average life insurance in-force up 8% over the prior year quarter and average account values increasing 4%, both of which helped drive a 3% increase in operating revenues excluding the impacts from unlocking and the underperformance and alternatives.","Base spreads, excluding variable investment income compressed six basis points when adjusting for an unfavorable impact in the prior year quarter. So a challenging earnings quarter for the life business, however key growth drivers remain solid, positioning us nicely moving forward.","Group Protection reported operating income of $61 million compared to $63 million in the prior-year quarter, with this quarter's alternatives underperformance reducing earnings by $7 million. The loss ratio in the quarter was 74.1%, up 50 basis points year-over-year and sequentially as a higher underlying loss ratio was partially offset by favorable reserve review impacts.","G&A expenses decreased 7% as we continue to benefit from integration synergies, which resulted in a 120 basis point improvement in the expense ratio compared to the prior-year quarter. Overall, business trends remained positive, which resulted in an after-tax margin of 6%. Favorable impacts from expense savings and pricing discipline should enable us to sustain attractive margins.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus stands at $9.4 billion and our RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 425%. Holding company cash came in at $765 million, ahead of our $450 million target as we pre-funded a $300 million debt maturity due in February 2020 to take advantage of attractive rates. During the quarter, we returned $224 million of capital to shareholders, included $150 million of share buybacks.","To conclude, third quarter earnings were definitely noisier than usual with significant impacts from our annual assumption review, underperformance of alternatives and other quarterly fluctuations. Looking through those items, we continue to see strong underlying earnings.","While the impact from this year's annual review was larger than previous years, driven by a prudent change to our long-term interest rate assumption, this is a non-cash charge, does not impact our RBC ratio and leaves our balance sheet well positioned for low interest rates.","I would also note that over the past five years, we have grown book value per share excluding AOCI by nearly 40%, including a 5% increase this year to $69.33. Importantly, this quarter's results had several positives, including double-digit sales growth in three of our four businesses, revenue growth in all four businesses when adjusting for unlocking and the underperformance of alternatives, continued discipline around managing costs, SG&A expenses declined compared to the prior year and all of our businesses continued to demonstrate strong core earnings power after adjusting for the items previously mentioned.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy.","We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up and then re-queue for additional questions. And with that, let me turn it back over to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW. Your line is open.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks, good morning. Randy, do you expect much ongoing impact from the actuarial assumption review to future earnings?","Randy Freitag","Hey Ryan. As I've said in prior unlockings, I'd expect a bit of a headwind from these changes. But when I sit down, I take a look at analyst expectations for the next quarter. I don't see much of an overall impact. I think there are a couple of items that I'd point out as we move into 2020, outside of that impact. First, as we mentioned, the decline in rates has moved spread compression up a little bit. So we have been traveling in the 2% range and I think we're up towards 3%.","So if you do the math, that's approximately $20 million. And the other thing I'd point out is that resolutions that we've had with some major reinsurance partners this year, I think would imply a headwind of a similar magnitude, but I also point out that we've been having these exact sorts of impacts over the past five years or six years and we are going to work hard to overcome them with things like the digital program. So, I don't see much other than the items I mentioned, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger","Got it, thanks. And then just higher level, clearly had a number of things go against you this quarter. It sounded like I think in your prepared remarks, you sounded like you were pointing to $2.40 is still a pretty good run rate going forward. Just wanted to confirm if that's kind of your intention to suggest that's a better run rate going forward past this quarter?","Randy Freitag","Ryan, absolutely. So I said approximately $2.40 in my script. We've noted that the earnings themselves reported were $0.25 negative, but the three specific items we mentioned, which were the unlocking, which was $2 per share, which was the alternatives underperformance primarily in that one security was $0.47. So if you add those two items to what we reported, you would get to $2.22.","The other items we mentioned were the individual life mortality. That was $29 million. Then also mentioned that the group business itself had a bit of a tick up, a little bit of a tick up in their loss ratios and that was in the range of $13 million or so. I also noted that, that was offset by a favorable reserve review impact, but so if you take the $29 million and $13 million, that would be another $0.20 or $0.21 or so.","So, if you add those items together, you'd get up to the approximate $2.40 that I mentioned and exactly consistent with sort of what we expect coming out of the quarter.","Ryan Krueger","Great. Thanks, Randy.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Alex Scott","Hi, good morning. I guess my first question is just on corporate expenses. I mean, it looks like it's running at a higher level and I know part of that is just pre-funding maturity next year, but I'd just be interested to hear where you expect that to run, I mean how much will that benefit from some of the things you're doing on the efficiency side as we think about next year?","Randy Freitag","Hey, Alex. Thanks for the question. Let me just speak to corporate or other operations in total. I'd say that this quarter had a few negatives that primarily were on the benefits line. I think if you look in there, we've seen some seasonality in benefits in other operations segment typically in the third quarter.","So I think there were some negatives, maybe in the mid-single digit range, but I'd point out that if you looked at across for instance in retirement, I think they had some small positives that probably from a total standpoint sort of offset each other. So Other Operations segment did have a little bit of a negative tinge this quarter, but I think that was offset by some other items across other businesses.","Alex Scott","Got it. And them a follow up I had was just with the stock trading where it is. Is there anything strategically you guys can do to take advantage of the situation, the valuation, the environment or is the macro where it is and rates as low as they are, I mean, does that kind of prevent you from acting?","Dennis Glass","Alex, it's Dennis. Our intention is to continue to review all options that would result an increase in the growth rate of earnings per share. I think the lower interest rates make that a little bit more difficult today, but there is a flow of ideas that are coming through, nothing that is imminent. So the answer is interest rates make it tougher, but we continue to review all opportunities, both from a normal growth perspective and the occasional unique item to grow EPS,","Randy Freitag","Alex, I'd also point out that it's just if you look at this year, we've been able to fund substantial growth in sales, in life and annuities while at the same time continuing to return capital to shareholders. I think year-to-date, we're at about $765 million of capital return, $540 million of that in buyback. So not only have we been able to fund the strong sales growth we've seen, but we've been able to continue to return capital to shareholders and obviously, that's our goal, to continue to fund organic growth while at the same time in a disciplined manner returning capital to shareholders.","Alex Scott","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Can you discuss, Randy, can you talk a little bit about what the underlying drivers were on the mortality and reinsurance pricing side? The reason I ask is, I'm just wondering have you reflected the rate that's been pushed through by the reinsurers currently, or are you assuming further rate increases or put through just - and I'm saying that just because you've obviously had adverse mortality in three of the last four quarters now.","So I just want to know whether, I don't know there is some, there is some level of assumed, we'll call it, adversity that's embedded in this review, whether it's reinsurance cost to your own mortality or whether you're assuming that, that normalizes or reverts back to like normal trend?","Randy Freitag","Tom, I think there are a couple of questions inside there. So let me hopefully tackle all of them. On the other impacts, and as we mentioned, the other impacts outside of interest rates totaled $112 million and $95 million of that was in the Life business. I will make a few comments on some of the components. ","So as we do every year, we obviously analyzed mortality, that's one of the big components. And what we found was there is a small slice of business where mortality rates are at the older stages. We're a little out of wax, we brought them in line with the rest of the book and that drove one of the negative impacts I referenced.","On the reinsurance side, really look at this as the completion of what has been a six-year process, which saw us back in 2014, put estimates in our models that reinsurance rates would go up. In 2019, we completed negotiations with most of our major reinsurance partners and really have good clarity on the few remaining pieces.","So I believe that this puts that issue largely behind us. On the favorable side, modifications to policyholder, behavior assumptions, investment allocations and some of the other items, I think this is just the nature of assumptions, things emerge, you see more experience, it's going to lead to some pluses. It's going to lead to some minuses, and hopefully over time they equal out. This year, unfortunately they were on the negative side.","But once again over time and we've actually seen this, they have tended to even out. I think I looked at this recently over the last decade and looked at de-unlockings by with all the pieces. And outside of interest rates, what you see is that over the last decade, all of the other items I really summed to a very small positive number actually, which speaks to our goal. We know when we price a product, we're not going to get every single assumption right.","We try to make sure that we do a prudent job of coming up with some best estimates and then hope over time that the totality of those assumptions will equal at least from a financial standpoint, the impacts, the numbers you have been, you are pricing, and that's what we've seen over a longer period of time. Not to diminish the $112 million negative impact that we have this quarter.","I think you also inside your question had a comment or a question about, you know, the last few quarters and it's a fact that in three of the last four quarters, we've had a negative or unfavorable mortality, but I think inside of there, Tom, I think that's a bit of cherry picking because it's also a fact that if you look at the last eight quarters that I can say that five of the last eight quarters have had favorable mortality and that's what we expect, all right. So we retain more insurance these days over the last five years or six years, we have done some more captures.","So we expect that we're going to have more quarterly volatility, but once again, over time we expect that mortality will come in line with our expectations. That's what we've seen over the last couple of years, that's what we've seen over the last decade and that's what we would expect going forward.","Thomas Gallagher","That was helpful, Randy. And from what Dennis mentioned on impacts and I think you reiterated that point, it sounds like there is not much of a statutory impact expected based on low rates, but what about a consequence of this charge? Is there any, should we think about any reduction in stat earnings because I think at least the comments I heard, it seemed more be directed at the balance sheet, I'm just curious whether you would expect there to be any impact to statutory earnings or cash flow?","Randy Freitag","Not going forward, Tom. I mean I think for this quarter obviously the alternatives that flows through statutory earnings and this quarter's unfavorable mortality would flow to this quarter's earnings but not going forward, I don't see an impact.","And as a reminder, on our statutory asset adequacy and testing, Dennis mentioned this, we really don't see negative impacts until that 10-year treasury using that as a proxy, gets down to the 1% range where we see roughly $350 million of asset adequacy reserves required, 50 basis points on the tenure goes to about $700 million. Those aren't small numbers, but those are manageable numbers in the context of a company with $9.4 billion of statutory surplus.","Thomas Gallagher","Got it. All right, thank you.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Erik Bass with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Starting with the group business, you mentioned a little bit of softness in terms of the claims experienced this quarter. I was just hoping you can give a little bit more color there on what drove that?","Randy Freitag","Yes. So inside the group, which had $61 million of reported earnings, you had a favorable impact from the reserve review this year of about $10 million and then offsetting that you had slightly elevated loss ratios in the quarter and that was pretty much evenly split between life and disability, and in both cases, it was driven by severity. So life claims came in a little higher than our average expectation and the average reserve we put up on new LTD claims came in a little higher than our expectations.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. And then on the interest rate assumption change, I realized you moved more than just the kind of long-term rate assumption, but you kind of put in context the change this quarter versus the guidance you had given, I think at Investor Day of $160 million impact for a 50 basis points change.","Randy Freitag","Yes, Erik, I'll take that. So the guidance we've given, which has really been focused on a change in that ultimate rate assumption has been $160 million per 50 basis points. This quarter, we reduced that assumption by 25 basis points and we saw pretty much exactly half of that $160 million. I think it came in at actually at $74 million.","Additionally, you have heard us reference in the past, maybe it was a couple of years ago, referenced the fact that at least from a financial impact standpoint, we saw that five years of grade was roughly the equivalent of 50 basis points cut and that, once again, that's what we saw, we extended our grade from five to seven and we saw roughly that impact came in at $78 million.","So you sum those up, $152 million, I think of what we did this year has been pretty much economically or financially equivalent to a 50 basis point reduction in the ultimate rate. So when they some up to 25 basis point reduction and the extension of the grade I think about it has been pretty much equivalent from financial standpoint to a 50 basis point reduction.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then the remainder is just truing up for actual versus expected rates over the past year?","Randy Freitag","Yes, and this isn't a number, which has been in our results every year, just at a much lower level, but we've never seen year-over-year, the kind of underperformance we had this year to help you understand this quarter. Third quarter we invested due money at $370 million. But there was deceleration as you were moving throughout the quarter.","And so the rate we embedded at the starting point was actually lower than the $370 million that came in overall the books of business on average at about $350 million. As a reminder, last year in the third quarter, we were investing money at $430 million at that time. And of course that number in our model would have been grading up over time.","So that can give you a sense of the magnitude of the drop in the starting point that drove that $139 million impact.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to start with RPS, earlier this week, there was some chatter in the media about some reviews of the 403(b) business, in particular, the K-12 business. So just curious, how big of business is that for you guys within the RPS segment?","Dennis Glass","Yeah, this is Dennis. It's about10% of assets, 4% of annual deposits. So it's not very big for us.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then I guess maybe high level for Dennis. As you think about the current interest rate environment and assuming that we don't really see any material changes from here, how are you balancing this trade-off between kind of growth at the product level and then using some of the freed capital for, if you don't grow for share repurchases?","Dennis Glass","That's a big question and a good question - a big question and a good question. As I've said in my script, we have to balance maintaining the strength of the franchise, getting the appropriate returns on capital, repricing where necessary and using capital both to grow the business, protect the franchise and then use what's left over to buy back shares, increase the dividend.","So it's always a balancing act. I can tell you without question that if we aren't getting the returns on products that are appropriate for our model, we will slow those product sales down and use the freed up capital to buy our shares back, and we've been doing that on and off over the years successfully. So very much a daily decision about where we can get the best return on capital, not a daily decision, but an ongoing decision.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, thanks Dennis.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Barnidge with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Barnidge","Thanks. Can you talk about the strong growth in Group sales and maybe how much of this was new distribution partners versus maybe brokers taking you out of the penalty box and your expectations going forward?","Dennis Glass","Sort of all of the above. We saw a good growth in our life business, good growth in disability, but a little bit less growth or actually negative at dental. And so it's across the spectrum. As I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing a little success in large case market which is getting us out of the penalty box. As I mentioned, the employee paid market were up quite a bit, 45%, that's cross selling more into the Liberty block where they had not as much emphasis on employee paid sales.","Within the book, we're seeing a lot of upselling with existing customers, I think that was up pretty significantly. The upselling with significant customers is if a client has just used us for LTD and they ship over to, say, adding the lifeline. So there's all of these specific issues, but it's the overall strength of the portfolio and bringing - the overall strength of the two companies and using that to increase in sales.","John Barnidge","Great, thanks for the answer. My follow-up, I will yield.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Elyse Greenspan","Hi thanks, good morning. My first question is on the Group business. So the loss ratio was a little bit higher this quarter, which you guys pointed to in the prepared remarks. In terms of seasonality, how should we think about, just thinking about the loss ratio for the fourth quarter, any trends that you kind of want to highlight to us?","Randy Freitag","Elyse, I'd make a general comment. That historically and that doesn't obviously guarantee it's going to happen, but historically we've tended to see a little bit of a tick up in our loss ratio in the fourth quarter. Can't tell you exactly what drives that seasonality, but if you look back at our results, I think you saw a little bit last year in the fourth quarter, for instance.","So now that 74.1% we reported, which as I mentioned, had two offsetting items inside of it. I think is right in line, maybe even a little better than our long-term expectations, but to your direct question, historically, we would expect to see a little bit of a tick up in the fourth quarter, we have seen historically a little bit of a tick up in the fourth quarter.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thanks. And then my second question, so with your annual review, you guys ticked up the grading period associated with your rates to seven years from five years, you said. Just as you were doing the review, I guess, can you just provide us why you kind of you guys settled on seven years as opposed to something else, just kind of background there that you can, any additional color?","Randy Freitag","You know, Elyse, I don't think there's anything specifically we can speak to other than it just felt like we are in an environment where getting to the final answer, if you will, or getting to that ultimate rate just felt like it was going to take longer than it did coming in. We came into this year at five years, we felt good about that, but as we looked around and thought about all the things that can and are impacting interest rates, it just felt appropriate to us to think about a little longer period of time before all those various items unwound.","Dennis Glass","And there's a lot of forward-looking and backward-looking analysis that we do. But on the specific issue, one of the examples of what we would be thinking about is a historical look back at how quickly in other historical periods that interest rates moved up from one level to the other one. So that would be an example of what we looked at along with other issues to form a judgment about seven years versus five years.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Nadel with UBS. Your line is open.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. I realize that this is a challenging environment and I also realize that the question I'm going to ask may seem a little bit extreme, but it sounds like you've probably given us the path to do this math in any case. If, Randy, if someone said to the entire life insurance industry, Lincoln included, no more of this assumption of rising rates over time, and your balance sheet needs to reflect the current rate environment as it is today. Period.","So let's just put it in round numbers and say instead of a 3.5% 10-year in seven years, let's just assume it sticks at 175 basis points or 2% for the foreseeable future. How big of an impact would that be on whether it's book value per share or just common equity? And similarly, would there be any related impact on a statutory basis from that kind of an extreme?","Randy Freitag","So let me take a crack at your question, and I doubt that I am going to be able to answer it exactly, but we have an assumption of the 10-year treasury reverting to 3.5% which seems quite reasonable given all the expectations for growth and everything, but today the 10-year treasury is about 175 basis points lower than that. So, we have an estimate that each 50 basis points reduction is approximately $160 million. We haven't tested and we don't have guidance out there at 175 basis points, but typically we've seen that, that size adjustment has been fairly static for each 50 basis points.","So you can --","John Nadel","Okay, that's ratable.","Randy Freitag","And I also talked about rates at this level in the statutory balance sheet. Once again, we don't see at this level of interest rates any need for additional, any material need for additional asset adequacy reserves. So really not much impact on the statutory balance sheet. The other thing I'd point out to you is that we carry in our overall book value $32 per share of unrealized gain.","So if you were to mark your liabilities to market, you would logically think about that rather healthy unrealized gain, which from a dollar standpoint is over $6 billion after tax, I believe, going against any sort of impact like that.","John Nadel","Yes. No, that's what I'm trying to get at. I mean, I know the stock is down like it is today and on the surface, this is a pretty significant charge relative to the impact of the last several years, but even still if we went to that extreme it feels to me like it's somewhere in the $3 per share to $4 per share impact non-cash. And I guess that's what I was trying to get at. So, thank you.","Randy Freitag","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Joshua Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Joshua Shanker","Yes, thanks for picking up at the end of the call. I mean, Suneet now has kind of asked my questions, but I was wondering if we could dig a little deeper. In this SEC investigation into the K-12, can you explain on what they're looking for? And in the past, has these kind of regulatory issues kept you from growing organically or inorganically in that segment of the market?","Randy Freitag","Yes, I'm not giving - we can't get into depth on that. In that market, we have salaried employees, and so I think our practices are pretty good, but I really don't know what is driving those inquiries.","Joshua Shanker","Okay. And then if you go back to last year, I'm just wondering about the timing of the process. What was sort of the gap in time between your recognition that there was something wrong between the stock price in the fundamental value of your business and you signing a deal with a theme to bring some earnings into the future to accelerate shareholder return, I guess? If that's true today, I'm wondering how long the process in between wanting to do something and being able to do something has there been?","Randy Freitag","Well, that's a pretty tough question because we're always talking to people and we've been talking for a long time, but not in sort of a negotiation, it will have a quick - it will have a quicker and vice versa. So it's very hard to pinpoint any kind of a non-organic transaction in terms of what's the likelihood. So I'll just say that each one is different and we continue to look at opportunities.","Joshua Shanker","Okay, thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions right now. We will be able to follow up with those in the queue later this afternoon. I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni.","Chris Giovanni","Thank you all for joining us this morning. We'll follow up with those that are still in the queue and as always, we will take your questions on the Investor Relations line at (800) 237-2920 or via email at investorrelations@lfg.com. Thank you all. Have a great day and a great Halloween.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."],"13108":["Lincoln National (NYSE:LNC) Q1 2014 Earnings Call May  1, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jim Sjoreen - Executive Officer of Investor Relations","Dennis R.

[Operator Instructions]","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Jim Sjoreen. Please go ahead, sir.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you, operator. And good morning, and welcome to Lincoln Financial's First Quarter Earnings Call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, income from operations and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Lincoln had a very good first quarter, continuing the operating and earnings strength we have seen develop over the last several years. One of the highlights of the quarter was operating revenue reaching $3.2 billion, up 10% from a year ago. The growth achieved reflected continued overall franchise strength, strong sales, positive net flows and equity markets driving higher account balances. Operatings per share were up 31% year-over-year, resulting in a return on equity of 12% for the first quarter. Earnings per share growth exceeded revenue growth as every line of business showed margin improvement compared to last year. We repurchased 3 million shares during the quarter at a cost of $150 million. We see value in buying back our stock, and it remains a key component of our 2014 capital plan.","We also continue to focus our attention on key strategic actions, including tapping distribution to expand our presence in new and existing markets, repricing essentially our entire product portfolio, which we have completed and diversifying product risk by balancing sales of products with an emphasis on those without long-term guarantees. We ended the first quarter with 2\/3 of total sales coming in the form of shorter-duration guaranteed products. Over time, this emphasis will meaningfully change our In-Force risk profile. Our efforts to increase investment income by adding alternative investments and select new classes in our fixed account showed progress.","I'll provide more detail on these results and other actions, so let me now turn to the business lines. Starting with the Life segment. The majority of our product repositioning over the last 2 years has been in the individual life line, with a focus on pricing actions necessitated by low interest rates while we have simultaneously diversified product risk by primarily reducing long-term guarantee sales. We completed the major repricing in the first quarter with the introduction of a new MoneyGuard product. New business returns across the Life portfolio are now comfortably within the 12% to 14% range.","Sales of our individual Life products were up 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. Our results benefited from continued strong sales of Indexed UL, Variable Universal Life and Term. Lower MoneyGuard sales were due to the new product introduction. COLI sales, which are lumpy, declined this quarter, but we expect good results for the year. In addition, we maintained the diverse, profitable solution set that we have been building over time as evidenced this quarter by no single product accounting for more than 30% of our total Life sales. The strength of our well-balanced, profitable product portfolio, teamed with the depth and breadth of our distribution relationships, position us well to adapt to market dynamics and client needs and will help us continue the sales momentum started in the first quarter.","Turning to our individual annuity business. It was another quarter of outstanding results. Annuity sales of $3.4 billion drove positive net flows of $695 million. Total account values of $117 billion were up 15% from a year ago. Long-term guaranteed sales dropped to about half of total annuity sales, helped by strong fixed annuity sales, increased emphasis on VAs without living benefits and reinsurance.","Total variable annuity sales, $2.9 billion, were flat over the prior year quarter. We continue to shift our wholesaler focus to be in line with our strategy of reducing reliance on VA living benefits.","We would expect to make further progress toward this goal when we launch an investment-focused product later this year. The solution will provide an efficient platform for account value performance and complement our existing products. As I've said before, I like our approach to the annuity business, notably, the volume of sales we are getting and the profitability and risk profile of new business in today's environment. The strategic consistency we have demonstrated from pricing and product actions to our best-in-class distribution, industry-leading risk management and effective hedging, I believe, gives us a competitive advantage regardless of how the industry evolves over time.","In our Group Protection business, we remain focused on repricing our employer-paid life and disability business, as well as pivoting toward employee-paid segments. Last quarter, I stated that we had approximately $1 billion of earned premium associated with our employer-paid life and disability business. In the first quarter, we repriced about 25% of that $1 billion and achieved our target rate increases. Sales of $64 million in the first quarter were down 10% from the prior year. This is a response to the employer-paid price increases we implemented on new business in the beginning of the year.","Our pivot strategy toward the employee-paid segment is performing well, as sales in this segment represented more than 60% of total Group Protection sales, up from nearly 50% in 2013. Further illustrating this shift, the industry data showed that, in 2013, we increased our ranking in this space moving up to 8th from 10th. Efforts to reprice the employer-paid business and strengthen our employee-paid platform will remain our near-term focus.","Our Retirement Plan Service business continued its strong performance. Total sales of $1.8 billion in the quarter were up 5% from the prior year, contributing to account value growth of 12%. In the small market segment, we are leveraging the strength of LFD by expanding shelf space with existing partners like Merrill Lynch, growing our sales force by almost 30% and broadening our product portfolio, all of which led to first year small market sales being up 31%.","We also expanded our presence in the mid\/large market, including a push into the government space that started last year. Our overall mid\/large market sales pipeline is strong with 67% of sales coming from consultants and advisers that have never done business with us before. Net flows were negative in the first quarter due to the lumpy nature of this business as we win and lose large cases. As an example, we started the second quarter off on a strong foot with the implementation of our largest government case to date, a $385 million plan with the Washington transit authority. Looking ahead, we will continue to grow our footprint in the small-case market through expanded distribution; build out our strategic partnerships among consultants, wirehouses and independent planning firms; and differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our high-touch value proposition.","Moving to distribution. The depth and breadth of our retail, wholesale and worksite teams enabled us to continue to achieve strong and diversified mix of sales by product and channel. This included our strategic shift to sell more products without long-term guarantees, where, as I mentioned, total sales reached 2\/3 in the first quarter. At Lincoln Financial Distributors, our wholesale distribution, the number of producers selling Lincoln products rose 8% year-over-year, reaching more than 65,000.","Simultaneously, productivity increased with repeat producers and producers selling more than 1 product both growing by 17%. Our cross-sell initiative is gaining momentum, as demonstrated by 24% of RPS small-market sales coming from referrals of producers selling our annuity products.","We expanded our LFD sales force in the quarter to drive our strategies to grow Life and RPS, as well as to shift sales to products without long-term guarantees. The total sales force is now 600 strong. This distribution scale and our broad product portfolio, combined with leading sellers of our products and our cross-sell initiative, is a competitive advantage for us.","Shifting to Lincoln Financial Network. Our retail distribution successfully recruited affiliated advisers, growing the adviser network to more than 8,500, a record high. LFN is a strategic and another competitive advantage, delivering 13% of total sales and again, driving our shift to sell products without long-term guarantees. We are making investments in LFN that will build upon this success and deepen our retail strength.","Spending a minute on investment management. You have heard me talk in the past about having the flexibility to broaden our investment strategies, and we continue to enhance returns specifically in 2 areas: alternatives and yield-enhancing debt. We are driving strong results due to our proactive actions to grow and expand these programs as evidenced by 24% year-over-year growth in our alternatives carrying value and an incremental 22 basis points contributed to our new money yield during this quarter from yield-enhancing debt.","As we expand these programs, we maintain substantial room to increase our exposures while remaining disciplined in our execution. Our overall portfolio credit quality is A- with only a 5.5% exposure to below-investment-grade assets. In the first quarter, our new money yield of 4.6% was 40 basis points above our average new money yield in 2013 and within 60 basis points of our fixed income portfolio yield, further easing the rate of spread compression we have been experiencing.","Let me close my comments today briefly by saying, once again, that we had a very good quarter. The actions we are taking led to strong results that will help set the tone for the remainder of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to Randy. Randy?","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $365 million or $1.34 per share for the first quarter, up 31% from the prior year period. The quarter's results provided a strong and clean start to the year. While there were small pluses and minuses right across the segments, in total, there were no normalizing earnings adjustments that I would spec out for you.","Similar to the first quarters of prior years, we did experience elevated mortality in the individual life business that I will discuss in more detail during the segment discussion. In addition to strong earnings, the quarter featured strong performance across most financial measures, including robust top line performance, as noted by Dennis, with operating revenue growing 10%; expense discipline with G&A, net of capitalized expenses, up 4%. Coupled with the strong revenue result, we saw G&A as a percent of revenues decline 70 basis points year-over-year; and book value per share, excluding AOCI, continuing to grow nicely, up 9% to $45.63; while return on equity came in at 12.2%.","Share repurchase for the quarter totaled $150 million. As always, we'll look to meet or exceed our annual target of $500 million to $550 million depending on how the year develops. Remaining authority under existing share repurchase authorization is now down to $208 million. And so consistent with past practice, we do expect to go to the board in a few weeks to ask for an increase to the authorization.","We had very good results from the investment portfolio with realized losses related to investments coming in at $17 million for the quarter, with most of the losses coming from a few assets that get mark to market and that do move around from quarter-to-quarter. Despite a fair amount of volatility in the capital markets, the hedge program had another strong quarter with $14 million of breakage, which is well within our pricing expectations.","I will point out that we did include a new page in the stat supplement that breaks out our earnings on a pretax basis by their source. We're providing this information as a supplement to existing disclosures in order to provide more clarity on the underlying sources of earnings versus what's disclosed in the traditional segment reporting. The data is going to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter so annual results will provide a cleaner picture on the trends in our mix and progress towards our long-term goal of increasing the contribution for mortality and morbidity margins.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $216 million, a 36% increase over the prior year. Operating revenues increased 17% from the first quarter of 2013 as positive net flows and strong equity markets drove a 16% increase in average account values that, at the end of the quarter, reached a record $117 billion. The ROE in the annuity business remained in line with the outperformance of the segment, coming in at 26.8% for the quarter. Strong earnings, revenues and returns, another quarter of great financial performance for the annuity segment.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $39 million. Year-over-year revenue growth of 4% benefited from a 10% increase in fee income from assets under management. Account values increased 12% from the prior year period and ended the quarter at a record $52 billion. The pace of spread compression in the retirement segment has slowed as normalized spreads came in 8 basis points lower compared to a year ago and 1 basis point lower compared to the prior quarter. Return on assets for the quarter of 30 basis points and pretax net margin of 35%, a commonly used industry metric, both came in at the high end of our expectations. A really good all-around quarter for the retirement business. I'm especially encouraged to see strong earnings growth despite the headwind of spread compression.","The Life Insurance segment reported earnings in the quarter of $120 million. Earnings drivers were strong in the quarter, with average account balances up 7% and Life Insurance In-Force of $623 billion, up nearly 5%. As I mentioned earlier, we did experience elevated mortality, and that negatively impacted the quarter by $18 million, but between expected seasonal mortality that we often experience during the first quarter and additional mortality above our expectations. Strong performance from the alternative investment portfolio offset about 1\/3 of the mortality experienced.","I would also note that the reserve financings that we have been doing in the Life segment do serve as a headwind to segment earnings growth. As you may recall, we did complete reserve financing in 2013, and I'd estimated that it negatively impacted Life's earnings by $5 million or so compared to the first quarter of 2013. Of course, we have been able to deploy much of the capital freed up by these transactions, which has benefited earnings per share and return on equity.","The Group Protection segment reported earnings of $20 million in the quarter, a 43% improvement from last year's first quarter. The nonmedical loss ratio of 74.8% was flat with the prior year quarter and remains just outside the high end of our target range. Earnings benefited from improved margins in all product lines with the exception of long-term disability. LTD incidents did come in above the prior year period but for the quarter was offset by lower average reserves on new disability claims.","As Dennis noted, we have begun to take the pricing actions outlined on last quarter's call, and that process will continue over the next 7 or 8 quarters As I mentioned last quarter, we expect approximately $300 million of our 2014 earned premiums to be repriced, and we remain on pace to achieve this target. The quarter's results are more representative of the earnings power of the business, and with the pricing actions underway, we are encouraged by the fact that earnings for the quarter did come in at the top end of the guidance. However, I do remain somewhat cautious as we have yet to see an established trend in our experience, which will be an important step towards more consistent earnings performance.","Turning to capital activities. As noted earlier, we repurchased $150 million of our shares during the quarter. Additionally, we did have strong statutory performance, with statutory surplus ending the quarter at $8.2 billion while RBC came in north of 500%. During the quarter, we sent $150 million of dividends to the holding company. Those dividends, $500 million of debt maturities during the quarter, the share buybacks and other holding company cash flows left us with $562 million of cash at the holding company at the end of the quarter.","The quarter's results are a great way to start off 2014. Strong top line growth of 10%, disciplined expense management with solid improvement in expense ratios, continued capital deployment through share buybacks, consistent growth and strength in the balance sheet with book value per share up 9% and strong returns with return on equity in excess of 12%, these metrics all speak to the strength of the current quarter and when coupled with the strong new business returns, noted by Dennis, leave us with a great deal of confidence about quarters to come.","Before I turn the call over to the operator for Q&A, I do have an announcement to make, one of those happy and sad announcements. After more than 30 years of serving the company, 11 years in the role of Head of IR, Jim Sjoreen has decided to retire from Lincoln. So at the end of the year, Jim is going to be hanging up his spurs unfortunately.","Jim is going to continue to be your main contract -- contact as we go about the process of undergoing a search for Jim's replacement. On behalf of Dennis and the entire senior management team and myself, who has had the pleasure of working with Jim for some time, I would like to thank him for his many years of dedicated service. And we obviously wish him nothing but success in his next life.","With that, let's move to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Seth Weiss of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question is on the annuity segment and the run rate of earnings. And if we look at where the earnings are, on an adjusted basis, earnings are about 35% or so up from the first quarter of last year. That's about double the increase in the pace of the account values. I know there's an element of operating leverage there, but obviously, there's beneficial mix shift that's going on as well. Perhaps you could comment on just the sustainability of this earnings run rate and how we should think about earnings growth going forward, if it will more closely match growth in account value.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Sure, Seth. I'm going to throw out some numbers here, so I apologize for that. But the growth actually, if you use the sensitivities that we provide, and factor in things like net flows actually makes a lot of sense. Last year, in the first quarter, we made $159 million. Markets, on average, were up 21% from the first quarter of 2013. We have a sensitivity that we provide, which talks about $7 million or so for each percent movement in the S&P. That translates into $35 million to $40 million of quarterly earnings. So you add that to the $159 million and you're up to the $195 million to $200 million range. You factor in that we had roughly $5 billion of positive net flows over that period of time, $4 billion to $5 billion, you're talking about another $7 million or so of earnings. So now you're up to the $200 million to $207 million or $208 million range. Factor in some expense leverage, we're doing a good job managing expenses, you're up to somewhere between $210 million and $215 million. So I find the number during the quarter -- you can do that same sort of analysis compared to the fourth quarter also. So I find the number quite rational when compared to what we've earned in the past and feel very good about the dollars of earnings were making in the annuity business.","Seth Weiss - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's very comprehensive. So if we think about mix shift of business and what I'm thinking about there is new cohorts and hedging costs being less, given less rich products, I guess that's a de minimis amount then if we do the math that you just did for us.","Dennis R. Glass","I think you're seeing the profitability of that, that we've been talking about on our new business in a number of different places. You're seeing it in the earnings growth. You're also seeing it -- to use the new earnings by source analysis we provided, you see our profitability on VA writers up a little greater percentage than the fees on AUM, and that is reflective of the strong profitability that we're getting on new sales, which is reflected in a cost of hedging that is lower while, at the same time, we've raised fees on these products.","Operator","Our next question is from Jimmy Bhullar of JP Morgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question just on retirement flows. Overall, you mentioned the large cases in the first quarter. But you've reported a couple of negative quarters now in a row in terms of flows, and both quarters had high withdrawals. So I'm not sure if Chuck's on the call, but to what extent is this just normal [indiscernible]? Or are you seeing losses of cases in a certain market segment or in a certain part of the industry? And then, secondly, for Dennis, maybe if you could talk about how your preference for -- or your view on share buybacks versus other uses of capital, such as dividends or acquisitions has changed given the increase in the stock price over the past year?","Dennis R. Glass","Let me take the first one on RPS. We don't see any systemic issue with the fourth quarter negative flows and the first quarter negative flows in RPS. Predominantly, it's in the ebb and flow of large cases. As I mentioned, we're starting the second quarter of 2014 on a very positive note with plus $350 million from that one case. So I really say that, that's just the ebb and flow of large case activities and nothing systemic. If you see the continued positive growth in sales, expansion of the wholesaler market or the wholesalers, the addition of new consultants, I think the pipeline, it always -- it paints a very good story for the underpinnings for growth in that business.","With respect to share buybacks, Randy's more the expert but I'll start off on that. We continue to think, as I said, in my remarks, that buying the stock back at this price is a great investment. And obviously, to your point, the return on investment at today's price is a little bit less than it was a year ago when we were selling at a deeper discount to book. But nonetheless, in terms of the free cash flow that's being generated and has, by the way, consistently been generated over the last several years, we talked about the $600 million or so up at the holding company, coming out of the subsidiaries up to the holding company. And as Randy has said in the past, that's sort of our target amount for both the dividends and share buybacks. I'll also point out that we ended the quarter with RBC of 550%, which is a little higher than we probably managed to during -- north of 500% that we've managed to. So bottom line, we have the capacity, both from the generation of free cash flow, we have some capacity given our RBC position, and we think the stock -- purchase of the stock is a good value.","With -- let me go now to dividends. Dividends are -- have been increasing at pretty substantial percent increases over the last couple of years. Growth in the dividend is something that we believe in.","Obviously, it's the Board of Directors' decision, and we'd like to continue to see that growth over time. So those are those 2.","Now alternative use of capital, let's put it in the 3 buckets: one, share repurchases and dividends, which I've already talked about; two is new business; then, three is M&A. It's quite remarkable that the industry has moved from -- just generally speaking, has moved over the past 24 months from putting business out 10%-plus to now putting business out in the 12% to 15% range. And I can't tell you what every other competitor is getting in terms of internal rate of returns. But I can tell you that everybody has moved up, and we have very rational pricing. So putting new business out at these and across our businesses -- I mentioned we repriced all the business that had to be repriced. But we're in this 12% to 15% range across our businesses on a pricing expectation, a little bit north of that on the VA business, maybe fixed annuities dropped below the 12%. But the bulk of what we're selling has very good returns on the capital that we're deploying.","So that then leaves M&A. The M&A market is episodic. We never include M&A as part of our growth strategy. But if something comes along that would accelerate our growth strategy or our objectives, such as increasing mortality and morbidity, we'd take a look at that. And so that's our -- that's my broad view.","Operator","Our next question is from Joanne Smith of Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I have a couple of questions just on the VA market overall. Everybody's been talking about the fact that it's a hard market out there and that the returns on the business that they've been writing for the past couple of years are very attractive. In the past, that's always attractive. Additional capital to the market and competition has heated up over time. I'm wondering if you've seen any change in the environment and\/or if you expect that to change over the near term and if there are any particular competitors out there that are being aggressive.","Dennis R. Glass","Well, let's back up to last year because there's some repositioning in people reducing the volumes that they were interested in selling, and there were new entrants into the market. And that movement sort of affected the amount of business that we were getting. I think most of that individual company movement has settled down now. And when we look at the list of competitors in the marketplace today and the dispersion, if you will, of the business among those competitors, our view is it's as solid a group of competitors as we have seen for a long time. And although there are pricing movements at the margin, we don't see nor do we expect to see any overly aggressive pricing in order to capture market share. So just stepping back to the way I answered that comment before, the life business has been repriced and good competitors, good healthy environment. The VA business has been repriced, good competitors, good healthy environment. So we're pretty comfortable with both of those businesses.","In terms of competition, not getting crazy. Now from time to time, someone's going to come in possibly. And either one of them are going to try to establish a position, and for a short period of time, they may underprice a product intentionally to create market share. But the value propositions that we have across our businesses, selling business on our terms isn't going to be affected by an occasional outlier for good reasons or bad reasons. And the strength of our distribution adds a lot of comfort to our ability to pivot, as we've talked about. So I'm pretty optimistic, really, about the competitive environment where we stand.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Okay. So Dennis, then, all of the de-risking that's taken place in the products, a lot of product is being sold without a living benefit rider anymore. What exactly is the value proposition that you offer to the customer? And I'm wondering if we're going to start to see reprisal of those articles that were predominant in the press about the fact that variable annuities are a rip-off and blah, blah. It seemed to me that the addition of the living benefit guarantees was the differentiating factor between buying a variable annuity and buying a mutual fund and a life insurance policy.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Over the last 10 to 15 years, the value proposition changed, and I think it's moving back a little bit. So 15 years ago, the value proposition was a mutual fund and a tax-deferred wrapper. And that's how the industry and that's how Lincoln sold the product. For a lot of reasons, that value proposition evolved, as you pointed out, to more of an income guarantee. And I think the income guarantee, from a consumer perspective is going -- it will drive a lot of sales in the industry, and it will drive a lot of sales at Lincoln. And even though we're deemphasizing -- I've said this several times, but the long-term guaranteed business that we sell, we sell on our terms at risk levels that's acceptable to Lincoln and at returns that's -- that are acceptable to Lincoln. So the business that we are selling, we're quite comfortable with across our portfolio in long-dated guarantees.","So now let me go to present-state environment. There's a little bit of a shift, both from the consumer and the manufacturers to the old mutual fund and a tax-deferred wrapper. And in part, I think I said this last quarter, if you look at the marginal tax rates in your own tax returns this year, they've gone up dramatically as there's been a reduction in the benefit for tax reductions at the individual levels. So there really is a reason why people might come back into the old -- the objective of mutual fund inside a tax-deferred wrapper, and that's exactly what we're doing with this product that we're introducing in the next couple of weeks actually. Is that helpful?","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Yes, that's a good point.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallagher of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, good luck to Jim Sjoreen. Been great working with you. My question is just on -- if I have the numbers right, Randy, I think you said life earnings were down $5 million due to reserve financing. Is that -- was that the right adjustment on a year-over-year basis?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, that is correct, Tom.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Randy, how big of a financing was that related to? Was that $200 million, $300 million?","Randal J. Freitag","Last year, I think, we ended up with $450 million-or-so of reserve financing capital generation.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So -- okay. So if I annualize it, $20 million of costs related to $450 million of capital freed up. Is that the right math?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, that's roughly the right math.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So from your standpoint, now the stock's done well, so when you consider buyback versus the cost of reserve financing, I assume that tradeoff is still reasonably accretive. Is that something that you guys track pretty closely?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, it's very accretive. And you really can see it in the ROE on the -- when you get inside the overall company and inside the Life business, which if you didn't do this reserve financing, the Life business would get dragged down over time. So yes, we definitely look at the cost versus the reward of doing reserve financings, and it truly is a layup that it makes sense to do these reserve financings.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And would you expect, this year, there's still that opportunity? Would you expect a similar sized amount?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. I don't know that we'll do one this year. As I mentioned, $450 million last year's above our expectations. What I'd note though is that if you look at the last couple of years, back in 2012, we had stat operating earnings of about $800 million, and we did $200 million of reserve financings, for a total of $1 billion of the combination of 2. Last year, we had stat operating earnings of about $750 million. They were down a little bit because of some of the strain we had before we pulled out of New York, so on guaranteed universal life. But we have the extra reserve financing. So the sum of the 2 is about $1.2 billion. If you look here in the first quarter, you think that we've exited GUL in New York. GUL as a sales -- as a percentage of our total sales are down dramatically. You saw some of that benefit with stat operating earnings in the first quarter at $350 million. Now I don't expect that to be $350 million each and every quarter. I think we had a pretty good quarter. But my point is that I expect operating earnings and total deployable, whether it comes from financing or from operating earnings, to continue to be in that $1 billion range. So it gives us all the capacity we need to continue to support the deployment that we've done over the last 3 years. So if you want to expand your question beyond what you asked, just do I think we can continue to deploy capital at the same rate we have been deploying it for the last 3 years? Absolutely, absolutely based upon what the actual facts that have happened over the last few years.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Appreciate it. That was helpful. I guess the only other question I had related to RBC and your strategy is, Dennis, I know you had mentioned you continue to move along in terms of the yield enhancement strategy, including alternatives and I presume other higher-yielding securities. How big should we expect that program to be? And is that going to consume some RBC as well?","Dennis R. Glass","The alternatives program, near term, the account balances today are about $1 billion, try to get to about $1.2 billion, which is obviously 20%. But in the context of an $80 billion general account portfolio, not that big. And that does grab some RBC, but it's not been a meaningful amount in terms of our RBC planning. The second piece, which is some of these higher-yielding strategies within the fixed income portfolio don't necessarily have incremental RBC. So for example, BBB private gives much better, 20 or 30 basis points more yield, than a BBB public. And yet, from an RBC standpoint, the RBC calculation is the same. So yes, there will be some utilization of RBC but it's not significant enough to affect what Randy was just talking about in terms of overall statutory or free cash flow generation.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath of UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the mortality in the Life Insurance business. So first of all, can you give some perspectives in terms of what it was driven by? I mean we're hearing from some other companies that it's older aged, large cases. So any color in terms of frequency, severity in terms of what you saw on the quarter would be helpful.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes, Suneet. Normal first quarter experience, which is a seasonality that we and other companies talk about, is typically related to you see a lot of respiratory-, circulatory-related death, which is often linked to flu, pneumonia, that sort of stuff. So that's definitely in there. Over and above that, the experience, I think, relates to the -- partly to the fact that this was a colder, more severe than normal winter, and I think there's some of that in there. In terms of digging into the claims by age, by duration, by cohort, we didn't really see any trend other than the larger claims, the million-plus claims were a little above at a disproportionate piece of the $18 million impact. That's not surprising. I mean we sell big cases, we're a big case provider, so I'm not really surprised by that. So inside of the claims, we didn't see any trend other than the fact that it appears to be the normal sort of claims that you see in the winter months, which is flu, pneumonia, that sort of stuff related.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So all else equal, when you're giving us this $18 million number, is basically what you're saying that we would expect to kind of get that back in 2Q? I mean, again, there's always going be some fluctuation, but that's kind of how we should think about the $18 million. Is that right?","Dennis R. Glass","It's above our expectations. Whether it comes back or not I guess is, we'll know in second quarter. But it is above our expectations. That $18 million is above our expectations. Now in terms of mortality for the organization, I would point out that relative to the first quarter of 2013 in total, if you think about total Lincoln, it's about the same number as we had last year. We had $19 million actually last year in the first quarter, $12 million in individual and $7 million in group. We had good group experience this same time. So in total, mortality across Lincoln was about the same as last year. It just happened to be a little disproportionately represented in the individual business.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then you had also mentioned about 1\/3 of the $18 million was offset by higher alternative investment income. But you're also talking about maybe expanding that asset classes you've done in the past. So is the $6 billion, is that something that we should really think about as onetime? Or is that just -- it just so happens that alternatives were higher because you're been growing the book and that may not necessarily go away?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, there was some impact because the book has grown, as Dennis mentioned, about $1 billion at the end of the quarter. But the return on the portfolio was stronger in the quarter, $6 million inside the life book. I mean there were some small favorable impacts across the other businesses. I would estimate that total favorable impact, relative to sort of a 10% expected return over the alternative book, add about $9 million after deducting tax in total across the whole organization, so roughly $0.03, if you want to think about it that way.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one, just maybe a follow-up to Tom's question about the reserve financings. So what's the rationale in terms of not doing one this year? Is it just that you don't have enough sort of Life Insurance business warehoused or terms have changed? Or -- because it sounded like it's a pretty easy tradeoff for you, I guess, to do the deal versus buyback, a layup, I think, is your terms, in your words. So why not pursue one this year?","Randal J. Freitag","Just availability, it's the availability of financeable reserves at the company. So we did a lot last year, $450 million, as I mentioned. It takes us a couple of years of sales on the term book to build up the numbers to make a reserve financing that makes sense, i.e. would get up to about $200 million of excess reserves or so. So we did a big term deal last year, takes a couple of years to build up for the next one. On the GUL side, we're just not selling it much as we were before, so it's become a relatively small piece of the overall sales. So it takes a longer period of time to build up a GUL financing. So it just has to do with what we're selling today and the fact that we did a nice financing late in the year last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Congratulations to Jim as well. It's been an amazing ride. I appreciate all your hard work. The -- I want to touch back on the adverse mortality in the quarter and then a couple of those things. Randy, when you're talking about above expectations, you're looking at some A to E for the year. Would that be an accurate statement?","Randal J. Freitag","Basically, looking at what we price for, so what are the assumptions that go into a product that we price and comparing the actual results to that. That's our E for business that we've sold over the last 15 to 20 years. For older business where we may not have the pricing expectation, we use the standard industry table as the expectation. But for everything we sold over the last 15 years or so, we're just using the pricing expectation.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If you were to look at the $18 million, as you pointed out, there's always some adverse mortality relative to pricing expectation in the first quarter, whether it be a flu or a Christmas effect or whatever it is. How would this -- how would that $18 million -- what would you take out of that $18 million?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. I would say that about $6 million to $7 million, I would think of as seasonality, and the rest of it I would think as experienced above that normal seasonality.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then there are a couple of others. There was a statement you made that you saw higher incidence in disability but you put up lower reserves per claim. Why was that?","Randal J. Freitag","Well, the claim, the reserve per average -- the average reserve that you put out for each policy is necessarily driven by the incidents. Digging in those numbers a little bit. We had incidents in the quarter of just a little over 4, which is within our range. It was right in line with the experience we had last year. It was just a little above last year's experience. I'm not overly concerned about it, but I just wanted to point out that it was a tick above where we were in the first quarter of last year. In terms of the average reserve we put up for each claim, that's driven by all sorts of assumptions that go into the reserve, termination expectation, the type of claim, the average salary of the individual that went on claim. So just when you wrap all of those assumptions together, the average reserve was -- for each policy we put up was just a little over -- this year, it was at about $57,000 versus $60,000 last year.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the reserve financing, that $5 million, that was after tax?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, that was the after-tax impact.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right. So that's 2.9% after-tax cost of that. That's a no-brainer to go back and buy shares. Jim, all the very best.","Jim Sjoreen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Congrats to Jim as well. Dennis, I guess, first question for you. We've heard from some distributors that the high end of the market is seeing the premium finance market come back into play in a pretty big way given the low interest rate environment. So wondering if this is something you're seeing at Lincoln. As you know, Lincoln is a big case provider. Is it something you're seeing in the marketplace more broadly?","Dennis R. Glass","We're not seeing it.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then a federal oversight, I guess how are you thinking about this for Lincoln? I guess the reason I ask, I went to this ACLI conference a few months back and ACLI President and CEO, Dirk Kempthorne talked about how over half the premium volume of ACLI members are going to be subject to capital standards that differ from the states and believe that, if they're going to be regulated differently, that the remainder of industry, at some point, is likely to face new standards as well. Any thoughts in terms of how you're thinking about it at this point?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. Let me distinguish between the primary regulator of the states and the secondary regulator, whether it be the Fed, the Treasury or some international body. The states regulate at the subsidiary level. These others regulate at the holding company level. So that's a pretty important distinction. The industry effort is, first and foremost, to get the secondary regulators to use insurance-centric metrics for setting standards for solvency and what makes a strong company. And we're working together to accomplish that because it's the right thing for the industry. So that's what's being talked about. With respect to Lincoln, we have no expectation that we'll fall under any of the secondary regulators at all. And I've said this publicly a couple of times, the gatekeepers for what might be additional capital requirements are the rating agencies. And to my knowledge, the rating agencies are indifferent to what's going on at the secondary regulator basis. So I don't see secondary regulation, in any foreseeable future, affecting Lincoln.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then one last quick one, just for Randy, in terms of financial leverage. You had the $500 million of short-term debt roll off. Your supplement shows a leverage ratio of about 18.5%. Curious how that compares to the rating agencies' view of this ratio, how much debt capacity you may have and how we should be thinking about potentially relevering? Or are you still sort of focused on keeping it where you are or delevering?","Randal J. Freitag","It's the same message we've had for some time now, Chris. We're very comfortable with the leverage we're at today. Don't see a need to go out and add to that, but don't see the explicit need to continue to bring leverage down, which we had done over the past 3 to 4 years. So very comfortable with where we are today. In terms of the rating agencies, they all have their own particular measure or definition of leverage. So you get a fairly wide dispersion among all the agencies. We are in line with all of their expectations for a AA-rated company.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel of Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","To Jim, I'm entirely jealous. A couple of questions. I think you mentioned the new money yield of 4.6% for the quarter. I'm just curious. More than anything, obviously, rates continue to fall. So just wondering today in round numbers what the new money yield might look like relative to that 4.6%?","Dennis R. Glass","4.5%.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. On the Annuities side, on the variable annuity reinsurance agreement, just wondering where the capacity stands at the end of the quarter given the sales.","Dennis R. Glass","$3 billion out of the $4 billion remains.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Terrific. And then in the annuity -- I think you run the broker-dealer business results through the annuity segment. I'm just curious whether the broker-dealer is actually contributing any earnings or is that still a slight money loser, how that business is progressing. We've seen some great results from some others.","Dennis R. Glass","I'll let Randy answer it specifically. We don't run any business as a money loser. For very long.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that comment, Dennis.","Randal J. Freitag","It's a good story, John. The broker-dealer is contributing an amount of earnings that is consistent with the capital that we allocate to. Basically, what we're asking our broker-dealer to do is return a reasonable return on the capital that we have invested in it. It's a few million dollars a quarter.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the group side. So maybe, Randy, I just was having trouble keeping up. If you could just go through the -- I think individual life mortality was worse than pricing by $18 million after tax. Was Group Life priced -- Group Life mortality better than pricing by -- I think I got the calculation about $5 million after tax.","Randal J. Freitag","No, group was right in line with our expectations for the quarter. So what I said when I was combining the 2 a little earlier is that, if you go back to the first quarter of 2013, we talked about $19 million of mortality over and above our expectations. That was $12 million in individual, $7 million in group. That's last year. This year, we have $18 million of mortality above our expectations. It's just all in individual. So we have a similar dollar amount, the business unit that appears is a little different this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Krueger of KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Congrats, Jim, as well. Dennis, you've laid out an objective to increase the mortality and morbidity contribution from the mid-20s to 33% over time. Do you think you can achieve that organically? Or would that likely require some M&A at some point?","Dennis R. Glass","Likely require some M&A.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is there any sort of time frame you have in mind on the objective? Or is it just a longer-term one?","Dennis R. Glass","There really is no near-term objective. I think that what we're trying to do is to see our share price perform better over cycles. And so in the short term, the drivers of our earnings are all very positive and the mix that we have will continue to drive very acceptable returns. So there's no urgency with this objective. But I think, over time, that better diversification of earnings will provide more stability in the stock in periods of high volatility in the markets and so forth.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on the dividend, your payout ratio is around 12%. Some of your peers have been increasing the payout into the 20% to 25% range. Just wondering how you're thinking about your dividend payout ratio over time compared to peers.","Dennis R. Glass","We think about the dividend -- one of the earlier questions was how much capital do we have available to deploy, what's the generation of free cash flow at the holding company and expectation of growth. Those are the criteria that drive the recommendations to the board. Jumping to -- and I know the criteria of payout as a percentage of earnings is commonly understood and commonly used, but we're not focused on that as much as what's sustainable, what's the right increase, how much free cash flow we want to hold back for share buybacks or for dividends. And those are alternative decisions or that you should -- you can make decisions between those 2, grow the dividend on a logical and sustainable basis.","Operator","I'm showing no further questions at this time.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Lincoln had a very good year with the majority of our business segments performing well, operating earnings per share reached a record level, up 13% for the full year. Assets under management also reached a record level, ending the year at $207 billion. Operating return on equity for the full year was 12%. And book value per share was up 10%. All strong results, driven by numerous initiatives and strategies implemented throughout the year.","Touching on a few. We continued to take aggressive pricing actions across our businesses that positioned us for increased profitability. We effectively tapped distribution to drive our strategies, to pivot toward more profitable products and diversify risk. We maintained a best in class risk management capability. And lastly, we repurchased almost $450 million in shares, while ending the year with a very strong balance sheet, including a record statutory capital amount and RBC at 500%.","The one piece of the year which we were disappointed was our Group Protection earnings. We have already taken steps to get earnings back on track. Randy and I will share more details about this in a few moments.","So let's turn to the Life business. Individual Life had an impressive year with a 15% increase in sales. We made significant pricing improvements on many of our products and have a diverse profitable solution set. Full year sales of our Pivot portfolio, which includes Indexed Universal Life, Variable Universal Life, Term and flexible premium MoneyGuard, increased by 51% over the prior year.","This quarter, a new repriced MoneyGuard product will be introduced, which rounds out the pricing actions necessary to address the impact of low interest rates. Additionally, we will update our VUL product, a move that will boost already strong returns while maintaining competitiveness.","With these changes, the pricing on our entire Life product portfolio will be at the 12% to 15% return level, a higher level of return than in recent years and toward the top end of our expectations.","Looking forward, the depth and breadth of our distribution relationships, coupled with our proven ability to rapidly adapt to changing conditions, will enable us to keep offering smart solutions and capitalize on market opportunities.","Individual Annuities. Our Individual Annuity business also had a very good year, with strong sales, net flows and an effective hedge program adding to the drivers of strong equity markets and rising interest rates. We continue to grow the annuity business on our terms, including making the adjustments necessary to manage living benefit sales to our objectives.","In the fourth quarter, nonguaranteed living benefit sales were 18% of total VA sales, up from 13% in the third quarter, due entirely to shifting our wholesaler focus toward nonguaranteed products. Including the impact on sales covered by the reinsurance treaty with Union Hamilton Re, nonguaranteed products comprised 32% of total VA sales in the quarter. 32% is approximately our long-term target mix.","We expect product design and distribution to drive our sales mix goals over time. To help achieve this, later this year, we'll introduce an accumulation-based VA product, with an expanded fund lineup, specifically designed to grow our nonguaranteed sales.","So annuity deposits of $14.8 billion for the full year drove positive net flows of $5 billion, total account values of $115 billion, were up 19% from a year ago.","Let me turn to Group Protection. Weak earnings in the fourth quarter were primarily the result of poor long-term disability loss ratios. These results, coupled with poor mortality experienced earlier in the year, reinforced our need to continue to take aggressive pricing actions aimed primarily at our employer paid life and disability business. We began taking more aggressive actions in mid-2013.","Put this in perspective. We have about $1 billion of the earned premium associated with the employer paid business. More than 1\/2 of this will be repriced by this time next year and the majority in the following 12 months.","In addition to pricing changes I've just mentioned, we continue to have success driving our strategy to grow the employee paid segments, both voluntary and worksite. Through our investments in distribution and by offering a diverse product portfolio pivoting toward these product lines, which carry better margins, is another important ingredient in improving the earnings profile of this business.","Speaking to that change in mix, fourth quarter sales were up 30% from the same period last year, and full year sales were up 18% over 2012. The increase driven entirely in employee paid sales. These increases elevated employee paid sales to almost 1\/2 of the total 2013 sales, and we expect that number to grow to more than 1\/2 in 2014, a promising outlook given the profitability profile of the business.","Conversely, sales in the employer paid space were flat year-over-year and are expected to decline in 2014. We are confident that our powerful distribution system, better priced employer paid products and a diverse set of employee-paid solutions will lead to restored margins. Although earnings for the year were disappointing, the momentum from the actions we are already taking have us headed in the right direction.","Retirement Plan Services. The business performed well and we are pleased with our ongoing progress in the space. Total deposits of $6.8 billion in 2013 were up 6% from the prior year, driven by significant new sales in our mid\/large market and by the successful launch of several strategic small market initiatives, including our expanded partnership with Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and a broadened product portfolio that allowed us to reach clients at the larger end of the small market.","Account balances ended the year at a record high, over $51 billion, an increase of 17% due to a combination of new sales, increased employee contributions, continued strong client retention and favorable equity market performance. We did experience negative outflows in the fourth quarter due to the natural ebbs and flows of the mid\/large case market.","That being said, we have been more successful in keeping profitable business on our books as evidenced by planned sponsor termination rates in 2013 in our small and mid to large markets improving by more than 10%. As a result, we saw nearly $800 million of positive net flows for the year.","Looking ahead, we are optimistic about growth prospects in our Retirement business. Areas where we will focus our attention include expanding our distribution force in the small market, where we look to grow our wholesaler count by 40% in 2014, continuing to build out strategic partnerships among consultants; wire houses and independent planning firms, maintaining our push in the fast-growing mid\/large market and healthcare markets; and achieving operational efficiencies through platform transformation and technology enhancements.","Turning to Distribution. Our retail, wholesale and worksite teams continue to deliver outstanding results and help drive our overall success. The depth and breadth of our distribution franchise remains a core industry advantage for us, successfully driving the pivot to more profitable products and segments that I mentioned earlier. We have reached an all-time record number of third-party advisers and agents choosing to sell Lincoln products, now 66,000, up 11% from 2012. Not only did our active base expand, but productivity also climbed. In 2013, the number of repeat producers grew 21%, while the number of producers cross-selling more than 1 product grew 15%.","Looking ahead, with all of our products at attractive return levels and our focus on shifting and diversifying the mix, we'll continue to tap into the power of distribution by expanding wholesalers in RPS, Life MoneyGuard and Annuities, to advance our goals and deliver strong results.","Retail distribution through Lincoln Financial Network continues to be a leading driver of our strategy. We are making investments in LFN, aimed at strengthening our value proposition for independent advisers and their clients. An example is the recently announced relationship with National Financial, a fidelity investments company, as our clearing platform provider. Through this arrangement, we'll marry the technology strength of Fidelity with the proven distribution strength of Lincoln Financial Network.","And finally, in Investment Management. Our overall portfolio is well diversified and of high-quality, with an average credit rating of A minus. Year-over-year, our below investment-grade exposure decreased by approximately 1%, primarily due to a favorable credit migration and maturities. This gives us more flexibility to continue to broaden our investment strategies.","With respect to new money. Our average yield in 2013 was 4.2%. In the fourth quarter, we invested new money at 4.7%. And our yield-enhancing fixed income strategies contributed close to 20 basis points of this yield.","Our new money rate last month was approximately 15 basis points below the fourth quarter. At these levels, we are investing new money well above our average 2013 new money yield, allowing for continued easing of investment spread compression.","So let me close my comments today by saying once again that we had an exceptionally good year. Our overall performance and the action plans position us well for 2014 and beyond. Areas where we will focus our intention include: Increasing the diversification of our product sales to roughly 70% nonguaranteed and 30% guaranteed, this is across all product lines; increasing our margins over time coming from mortality and morbidity; returning margins on our Group Protection business to historical levels that will drive improved earnings; maintaining active capital management and best in-class risk management capabilities. And finally, further distribution, expansion and productivity improvements.","With that, I'll turn it over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $382 million or $1.40 per share for the fourth quarter, up 27% from 2012. The quarter's excellent results capped off a strong year, which saw full year EPS of $5.03, up 13% from the previous year. Of note, $5.03 represents the highest level of EPS that we have ever recorded for a year.","Looking at key performance metrics. We had strong top line performance, with operating revenue up 7.8% for the quarter and 5.8% for the full year, driven by drivers such as account values that ended the year at record levels, strong equity markets and interest rates that increased steadily over the year.","Across the company, a continued focus on managing expenses led to G&A net of capitalized expenses being essentially flat for the year. We saw a 10% increase in book value per share, excluding AOCI, to $45.23, while statutory capital reached an all-time high of $8 billion, with RBC coming at 500%. And last but not least, return on equity came in at 13% for the quarter and 12.1% for the full year, with both figures up over the comparable prior period.","As noted in the press release, we had normalizing items of $25 million or $0.09 per share in the quarter, primarily related to some reserve true ups and tax items. I will discuss the normalizing items in more detail during the business line comments.","A couple of other items of note during the quarter. Alternative and prepayment-related investment income came in somewhat above our expectations during the quarter, with the positive benefit offset by G&A that was above a normalized level. G&A was elevated due to incentive comp accruals, deferred comp-related expense that was driven by the increase in the share price during the quarter and the seasonality that we typically see in G&A during the fourth quarter.","Finally, good underwriting results in the Individual Business were offset by poor experience in the Group business. I will discuss the group results in more detail in a bit.","Net income results for the quarter and full year were fairly clean and straightforward. Realized losses were largely unchanged from the prior periods and head results were good, with little breakage free to the quarter or year.","Turning to segment results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $199 million, a 23% increase over last year. The only item of note impacting Annuity earnings for the quarter was an unfavorable $3 million dividend received deduction impact as we trued up the DRD as the final year-end data came in.","Operating revenues increased 16% from the fourth quarter of 2012, as positive net flows and strong equity markets drove an 18% increase in average account values that at the end of the quarter reached a record $115 billion. Returns in the Annuity business continue to be very strong, with ROE coming in at 26% for the quarter and 25% for the year and are indicative of the quality of the book. With our consistently sound product design and a relentless approach to risk management, 2013 was a truly great year for the Annuity business.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $34 million. Quarter-over-quarter, revenue growth of 5% benefited from an 11% increase in fee income as positive net flows for the full year and strong equity market returns led to a 16% increase in average account values, which at the end of the quarter climbed to a record level of $52 billion. The pressure on interest margins from low rates has served to mute the earnings growth in this business, with normalized spreads coming in 24 basis points lower for the year and 3 basis points from the third quarter. This is consistent with prior guidance and looking forward with rates at the current level, we expect spreads to climb by 10 to 15 basis points on an annual basis in the Retirement business.","Return on assets for the quarter came in at 27 basis points, within our long-term range of 25 to 30 basis points. Overall, 2013 was an excellent year for the Retirement business. Earnings grew 9% over 2012, return on equity was strong at 14.7% and return on assets of 30 basis points came in at the upper end of our targeted range.","The Life Insurance segment reported its strongest earnings quarter of the year, with $157 million or $146 million after normalizing for a reserve adjustment. Earnings drivers remained steady for the quarter and year, with average account balances up 7% and Life Insurance In-Force up 4%. As noted earlier, Life had good mortality experience for the quarter. The quarter's experience, which added approximately $9 million to the quarter, brought our full year mortality back in line with long-term expectations, a very nice way to end another strong year of operating performance for the Life Insurance business.","The Group Protection segment results fell short of expectations earning $11 million in the fourth quarter and $71 million for the year. The quarter's results included $8 million of favorable impact, primarily from a reserve true up associated with the accounting for LTD overpayment recoveries, offset by an accrual for unclaimed property. Earnings were negatively impacted by bad results in the LTD business. I'd estimate the negative impact on the quarter at $12 million after tax, with the negative impact coming from 3 main sources with roughly equal weight.","Incidents, which at 4.23 for the quarter, came in above the full year level of 4.06. We do typically experience seasonally high incidence in the fourth quarter, but 4.23 is somewhat above what we expected.","Claim size that ran above our recent experience and recoveries that came in below recent periods. In understanding the quarter's bad experience, it may be helpful to dissect our Group business into its component parts.","We had $1.95 billion of nonmedical earned premium in 2013. That premium is spread across the business in the following way: 55% or $1.1 billion is employer paid life and disability; 35%, or $700 million, is employee paid business; while 10% is employer paid dental. As we have analyzed the year's experience, the negative results can be attributed to our employer paid life and disability book of business. As Dennis mentioned, a significant portion of this book will be repriced by January of 2015. Let me explain when that repricing will appear in our revenues.","Approximately $300 million of 2014 earned premiums, with an additional $500 million of 2015 earned premiums, with the business nearly fully repriced by the end of 2016.","As we entered 2013, I had predicted that we would earn $80 million to $90 million for the year. We actually came in at $71 million for the year, so while I'd estimate that we are 6 months or so behind where we thought we would be as we entered the year, we do continue the process of rebuilding the profitability of the employer paid business to what it should be, and continuing the shift in business mix to a more employee paid book of business.","As we see things today, and assuming that loss ratio has returned to the 74% range that we experienced in the first 3 quarters of 2013, we expect to see earnings in the $60 million to $80 million range in 2014.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on some of the highlights of 2013, and what you should expect in 2014. 2013 was another great year from a capital generation and capital deployment standpoint. Strong statutory performance allowed us to upstream over $800 million to the holding company, which led us to deploy nearly $700 million in 2013, including $450 million in share buybacks, $128 million in shareholder dividends and $100 million in net debt reduction; and grow statutory surplus by $350 million to the previously mentioned record level of $8 billion.","Speaking to the consistency of our statutory performance, over the last 3 years, we have now upstreamed $2.7 billion to the holding company, deployed $2.2 billion, with $1.5 billion of that going into share buybacks, and growing statutory surplus by nearly $900 million. As we look to 2014, I would expect similar capital deployment to what we accomplished in 2013.","Additionally, we increased our shareholder dividend by 33% in the fourth quarter and ended the year with $1.2 billion of cash to the holding company, which includes $500 million as a pre-funding of first quarter debt maturities.","Taken altogether, 2013 was another year of excellent financial performance, record earnings, earnings drivers that end the year at record levels, and a record level of statutory capital all speak to the strength of both past results and future expectations.","With that, let me turn the call over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Giovanni with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dennis, first question for you. In the Annuity space, we've seen a number of kind of the traditional fixed writers see some nice growth here in the recent quarters, but really haven't seen any momentum in that product from you guys. So is it something with that product that you kind of don't like currently, or is it just you're seeing better opportunities still in the VA space?","Dennis R. Glass","Chris, we will -- the fixed annuity business has always been one of trying to get the right returns on it. And we can turn that business -- we can increase our sales on that pretty quickly given the distribution system that we have. So as interest rates rise and particularly the yield curve steepens, that gives you a better opportunity to get better returns. So I would say, in answer to your question, we can do a lot more volume if the interest rate environment is helpful to us getting returns in the 11%, 12%, 13% range. A lot of the strength in fixed and indexed annuities that you see is a little bit in the segment of the market that we don't play in, which is the high commission, high surrender and long surrender charge business. We've shied away from that over the years.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I'll ask one more then I'll get in the queue. I guess maybe more a question for Ellen -- but I'll ask Randy perspectives around kind of the investment portfolio, risk management related to the new derivative requirements that start to come on board in terms of what asset classes can and can't be posted, which I think points to probably more liquidity that the industry may need to hold over time. So just some perspective in terms of how you guys are thinking about this risk and kind of addressing it within the investment portfolio?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Chris, we've seen very little impact and expect very little impact on how we operate our business going forward. In fact, I'd say no impact on how we operate our business going forward. There were some new collateral posting requirements with Dodd-Frank and such, and those have added up to a big nothing so far, for us. So I don't anticipate a big change in the amount of collateral we're going to be posting, nor do I expect a change in the type of derivatives we use either in the hedge program, nor the small amount we may use in the day-to-day operations of the company.","Christopher Giovanni - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is that because the existing contracts are grandfathered in or even when new positions start to roll, you still would expect kind of no impact?","Randal J. Freitag","Anything new you put on, there are new collateral posting requirements. Just factually, just haven't added up too much, not anything that's changed the way we operate the liquidity of the organization. In fact actually the amount of additional post that we had at the end, I think was $2 million, to be specific. So the numbers are not going to change. The results of the organization are really the way we operate the liquidity profile of the organization.","Operator","Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a couple on the Group segment. Can you quantify the degree of these price increases in the employer paid book and, is this the first time in the last couple of years or that you've increased pricing here? Can you give us a sense of when the last time was that pricing was applied to this book?","Dennis R. Glass","Randy, let me take that. Let me put in perspective that we've repriced above -- renewals about 50% of what you do in renewals occurs in the first couple of months of the year. So if you go back to the early part of 2013, the first couple of quarters, we were kind of in the mid-lower single digits with our renewal increases, but with increases. As the year progressed, we moved above middle single digits to a little bit higher on our repricing, but again, a lesser amount of the current In-Force premium. And as we look into 2014 for the whole year, we are starting off in the mid to higher range and may even get up to the high single-digit range, mid to high single-digit range.","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And I guess the follow-up there is -- and then thanks for those comments. But the follow-up is, I guess we watched a bunch of companies in group benefit ratios, just broadly speaking, I know this is isolated to a particular type of DI, but I'd say group benefit ratios, broadly speaking, are maybe 200 basis points better over the last year. So I guess, frankly, it feels a little late in the cycle to have this issue, and so I guess I'd be interested in your response to that because it's kind of late in the cycle relative to unemployment drag. What do you think is causing this to crop up now?","Dennis R. Glass","You mean the higher incidence on LTD?","Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes.","Dennis R. Glass","There isn't anything in our underwriting or in our analysis of it, the incidence increase, that we can attribute to any particular case size or industry type. And it's popped up -- it could very well pop down, but we're not waiting for it to pop down. In the group business, this happens all the time. You have trend lines that have volatility around them, and you have to make a decision at some point. Is the volatility around the trend line raising the trend line permanently and do you need to reprice, or is it something that's going to come back? And we've just decided that we're going to increase prices because of where we saw ourselves with earnings in the last 2 quarters or the last couple of quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to start with the Life Insurance business. I think, as Randy mentioned earlier, fourth quarter is one of the strongest earnings quarters and represented, I think, a bounce back from previously unfavorable mortality. So I guess my question is, should we think about the run rate going forward as similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter? Or are you expecting maybe mortality might revert a little bit back to what we saw earlier in the year?","Randal J. Freitag","Suneet, so we made $157 million in the quarter, as I mentioned, we had an $11 million reserve true ups, so that puts you down to the $146 million. Additionally, I mentioned that mortality added roughly $9 million to the quarter. We don't normalize it out because mortality is something that is going to move around. I mean, just like morbidity in the group space, it's going to move around. I mean, morbidity went against us this quarter. So I think those 2 items is offsetting. But the quarter was definitely a pretty good quarter from a mortality standpoint. As I mentioned, when you look at the full year, mortality came back in line with our long-term expectations, which is what we'd expect. Basically, when we've seen variability in our mortality results in the Life Insurance business, over the past year, a couple of years, it's primarily been related to an increase or a decrease in larger-sized clients. And that's what we saw in the quarter. We saw large-size claims come down, which is what you would expect as we've grown the company and we've increased our retention of Life Insurance mortality experience. So nothing unexpected, a little bit more volatility in the year than one would want, but I wouldn't say it\u2019s unexpected. And for the full year, we ended up right in line with our long-term mortality expectations. And that's what I would expect going forward, sort of what we experienced for the full year as a trend line.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So maybe an average for 2013 as opposed to building off the fourth quarter result?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on Group Protection, it seems that it's a pretty big percentage of your book that you're increasing pricing on. I think you gave us the split of mix by line of business, but I think you combined life and disability. But even using those numbers, it seems like a pretty big part of your book. So I guess I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about lost business as you think about that $60 million to $80 million? Clearly, when you go back and reprice the business, you could lose some. So I just want to get a sense of what your expectations are on that front.","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. I think strengthening pricing is going to affect your sales levels. Specifically, we've guessed that the employee -- excuse me, the employer paid business will drop off from where it was last year. And we would expect the business, the voluntary business associated with the employee paid business separate from the worksite to drop off just a little bit. But we expect worksite to come up. So no big -- the mix will shift a little bit, will be down, estimating will be down a little bit next year, but it's not -- a little bit is single-digit-type declines.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last numbers one for Randy, if I could. The RBC ratio, I think you said you're estimating on the year, was it above 500 or at 500, just wondering if you had any kind of a benefit from this change in the mortgage experience adjustment factor.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, we did. We ended the year at right around 500. We're not done with the calculation, but it's going to be right around 500, maybe just a little above 500. We benefited from 2 things during the year in the RBC calculation: The change in the commercial mortgage loan, mortgage experience adjustment factor and also the normal process that goes on at the end of the year with the PIMCO\/BlackRock re-projection of the RMBS and CMBS securities. Both of those benefited us, I would estimate, roughly 10 points of RBC.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that 10 points combined or 10 points each?","Randal J. Freitag","Each.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Following up maybe on that last question, can we talk a little bit more about the capital position, which seemed rich. Clearly, it's a good problem to have. But what are your thoughts on capital deployment with this position, and even if you adjust for that $500 million of prefunding this quarter? So it seems like the Holdco liquidity is high and as is the RBC ratio. So any thoughts in terms of priorities and then kind of magnitude of capital deployment for this year?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. As I noted in my script, I am guiding a little higher than we have in the past. If you remember back to prior periods, we've typically talked about $400 million of annual deployment before shareholder dividends or roughly $500 million or so once you added in the shareholder dividends. If you go back to my script, as I mentioned, we did roughly $700 million in 2013, and I anticipate that total deployment next year will be in line with that same number. Now we have increased our shareholder dividends, so shareholder dividends are now up to roughly $170 million for the full year. But after that, you still have another $500 million to $550 million as opposed to the $400 million that we had talked about before. So we are in a very strong capital position. $700 million of cash at the holding company after the $500 million that we're holding for the first quarter maturities. That's $200 million above our target. As I mentioned, we are experiencing good, strong statutory results in the Life Insurance company, which is allowing us to stand up to the holding company. When you include the surplus note interest, roughly $900 million a year, so we're in a very good position to support the level of deployment I talked about.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And are there any new thoughts regarding the AG 38 subsidiaries?","Randal J. Freitag","No. We -- the results I talked about included an impact that we had in the state of New York, specifically related to guaranteed universal life. So the strong results included whatever we had to do for that particular item.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joanne Smith with Scotia Capital.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I just want to follow up on that question with respect to the RBC ratio of 500%. It seems to me that that's a bit high, and I'm just wondering what your thoughts around that are, given the fact that the statutory earnings have been so strong?","Randal J. Freitag","Joanne, as I mentioned a little earlier to I believe it was -- I forgot exactly. We did benefit at the end of the year from roughly 20 points from these 2 new items, items that we wouldn't have expected. So the 500 was higher than I expected as we came into the year, even as we moved throughout the year. So we do have to adjust a little bit for that. We continue to have a strong capital position. We continue to be generating strong statutory. And I think it's going to allow us to push strong flows to the holding company, which will allow us to be good and aggressive with our deployment this year.","Joanne A. Smith - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Did you give a target for deployment? I must have missed that.","Randal J. Freitag","Yes, I talked about $700 million, which includes some total of shareholder dividends, which will be roughly $170 million and share buybacks and other.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to get a better sense on what really caused the deterioration in the disability margins all of a sudden, because the margins had been fairly stable before but you're seeing incidents recovery, everything sort of a case size deteriorated at the same time in 1 quarter. So how much of this is a market issue versus maybe just mispricing that's showing up now? And then also, you're obviously raising prices on your UL block, but could you just discuss what type of returns you expect to get on the business that you sold over the past couple of years if we stay in this rate environment for a little bit?","Randal J. Freitag","On the group business, let me take that first. There are 3 main drivers of the group disability results, you're going to have your incidents, your average claim size and your recoveries. All 3 of those, as I mentioned, went against us this quarter, in a way that impacted the results by roughly $12 million. It's a bad quarter when all 3 of those go against you, and that's what we experienced this quarter. As Dennis talked about, we have analyzed the experience in 2013 and we are reflecting -- and pricing really started to reflect that in pricing in the middle of this year. When you price your product, it's not any different from pricing an individual Life product. And then one of the main components, one of the main inputs of the pricing process is your experience and how that's going to impact your expectations for the future. If you go back to the 2010, '11, '12 period, for incidents, for average claim size, you saw very steady and consistent results. Specifically for incidents, the number was right in the high 3-9s [ph]. It was very steady, very little variability around that number. For average claim size, you saw an average claim size that was $54,000 in 2010, growing $2,000 a year, right in line with salary growth, very consistent steady results. That's what drove our pricing over that period into the first part of 2013. When you come into 2013, you see a change in those metrics. Incidents goes up by about 0.1 and claim size doesn't go up by that 3% to 4% level, it jumps up by 6% to 8% by 4,000. The experience, we get that data as we moved through 2013, and we start to reflect it in pricing in the last half of the year. So we changed our expectations that we're putting into the pricing. That's what's happened, that's what's happened over the last half year and that's what will happen as we move throughout the following 2 years as the business reprices along the schedule that I talked about. The second question, again, was around life returns?","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, just on the business that you've sold the last couple of years. Obviously, you're raising prices on new sales, but what type of returns are you getting on that now in this rate environment?","Dennis R. Glass","The 2013, if we're talking about Life, 2013 expected return was about 12%. And when we look forward, we're looking more on the mix of business, depends on the mix of business, but more on the 13% to 15% range.","Jamminder S. Bhullar - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe another one on the VA business. Is there more capacity in the market for reinsurance or other types of solutions, assuming that you run out of the -- or you exhaust the coverage that you have on your current reinsurance contract. Do you think you'd be able to renew -- that you'd be able to get more coverage, if you could just talk about what you're seeing in the market?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. I mentioned I think the total was about 33% of effectively non-guaranteed product sales in the fourth quarter. About $500 million of that, 33% came from the reinsurance contract. When we look to next year, we're actually going to be well below the amount of -- or above our targets on non-guaranteed business because of that contract. That will give us -- that, in 2014, will give us time to work more organic ways to get to the 70, 30 in the VA business, which is what I talked about. More training around non-guaranteed sales and incentive for our wholesalers, new products that are oriented towards sort of the traditional mutual fund tax [indiscernible] kind of sale of the variable annuity. So we're pretty confident that with or without another reinsurance contract, we'll be able to get to our targets, specifically with respect to reinsurance contracts. It was a good transaction for everybody based on the circumstances at the time. If circumstances continue to provide good economics for both the reinsurer and the manufacturer, my guess is there'll be more opportunity to do these deals. But that's -- but that situation has to be in place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Berg with RBC Capital.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Randy, I wanted to review some of the numbers that you gave for the first time during this call. You said that approximately half of your group business is group life and group disability. Is that right?","Randal J. Freitag","Employer paid group life and disability.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Right. And what -- can you review the rate of -- at which the -- could you repeat the rate at which the incremental revenue from the price increases will hit your revenue lines and when?","Randal J. Freitag","So of the premiums we receive in 2014, $300 million of them will be at a repriced level. Of the premiums we receive in 2015, $800 million will be at a repriced level. And by the time you get into 2016, effectively, the vast majority of the business will be at a repriced level.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","All right. And so, just to -- my second question also just relates to the group insurance area. So just to clarify what has happened here, would it be right to say that as you have studied this, this wasn't a case of discounting that should not have happened? Let me start again. It seems to me that when any Life Insurance product is mispriced, it could happen for 1 of 2 reasons, either the price was too low to begin with and you're having claims experience consistent with your expectations, or there was no discounting of the price and you're getting claims experience different from what you expected. It seems like you're saying the latter here, that there was no discounting of pricing, it wasn't an issue of improper incentives or participation ratios that were too low. You charged the price that you thought was the right price and you're getting a claims level higher than you anticipated. Am I thinking about this correctly?","Dennis R. Glass","I think that's right, Eric. It's hard to parse out when you start talking about the net price that you have, which I think is what you're referring to as discounting. It's hard to parse out the specifics of that dynamic. And then you have the whole question of employee paid and employer paid is sold on a combined basis. So I think the conclusion, which you've come to, is the right one based on what we're seeing today. For whatever reason, the price that we were charging a couple of years ago was too low.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then, just if I could sneak one last one in really quick. Why should we think that profitability, why is profitability, given the competitiveness of the voluntary marketplace, the employee paid marketplace and the associated anti-selection that can take place and the turnover of employees with the associated anti-selection there or write-off of back and so forth, why is that business necessarily a higher-margin business than traditional group insurance?","Dennis R. Glass","I think you've answered your own question, because all of those things that you just said about the employer market -- excuse me, the employee paid market have to be taken into consideration and, therefore, you have to charge more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Schwartz of Raymond James & Associates.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I did want to follow up, I think it was Yaron who asked the question with regards to New York and the AG 38 issue, I don't remember who answered it. But whoever answered it seemed to suggest that, that had been dealt with. Is that -- and therefore, was already in the RBC. Is that an accurate statement? I was under the impression that this thing would stretch out over time.","Randal J. Freitag","We -- just like I believe most companies agreed to a rating period for the impact, 5 years in our case. We took this year's amount of that increase and those are reflected in the results that I talked about.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Randy, can you share that amount?","Randal J. Freitag","Sure. It was $90 million.","Steven D. Schwartz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","$90 million, okay. And then just still on the topic of regulation. Dennis, would you happen to know off the top of your head maybe how many states now have agreed, kind of if it's worked for it, but agreed to adopt PBR and how much premium that may represent?","Dennis R. Glass","Not off the top of my head, but I can, with respect to the premium number. But the number of adopting states is in the teens, and there's a tremendous amount of work jointly going on between the ACLI and the NAIC to get more adoption in 2014 and 2015. It's a, what's the expression? A long drill through a hard bore. I think a hard bore to long bore through a hard board, but we'll get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to follow up on the group business. So Randy, based on the earnings guidance of $60 million to $80 million for 2014, that implies or I guess I can infer the -- a little bit better than breakeven profitability from this quarter, you do view that a big chunk of that as just quarterly unfavorable volatility that you would expect to recover. So I assume that's the case just because of the much higher run rate that you expect not trending 4Q. But then at the same time, I know there's a multiyear repricing strategy ahead. So I guess I just want to get a handle for, you're clearly seeing something in your book that indicates there's a need to reprice, yet you are expecting substantially higher profitability than we got this quarter. I don't know, can you help me reconcile that in terms of what level of the deterioration this quarter you viewed as somewhat permanent versus the alternative?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. The way I get there, Tom, is we made -- let me apologize, as my voice has a bit of frog in it right now. We made $71 million this year. And over the course of the year, I normalized $11 million of favorable items, $8 million this quarter, $3 million last quarter. So core earnings of $60 million, normalized earnings of $60 million. When you factor in premium growth off of that, when you factor in the favorable impact of the repricing of the $300 million of premiums that I mentioned, you're going to end up with a number in that $60 million to $80 million range. Now if we do a little better than 2013 loss ratios inside of that, we'll wind up at the high end of that range. If we do a little worse than loss ratios over in 2013, we'll end up at the low end of that range, and that's just sort of the numbers. Just to remind everybody, we estimate that 1% of the loss ratio is roughly $15 million of earnings.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And so, you're clearly taking the full year annualized earnings view not necessarily taking some deterioration in 4Q as indicative of a trend, that's a better way to think about it?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. Yes, exactly.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then I guess just stepping back for a minute, you guys gave some numbers on sales growth, I believe, between employer versus employee paid in the group business. But if I look at a higher level, the revenue growth that you've been producing on group has certainly outpaced the industry by a fairly wide margin, at least the comps that we look at, who have had kind of flattish top line growth and you guys are in the high-single-digits range. Is it -- can we infer, is it as simple as you've been growing above market, taking some share and that's kind of what's driven the need to reprice here, or is that not the right math?","Dennis R. Glass","Could you rephrase that question again? I'm not...","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. Just -- Dennis, if I look just at the top line statistics that you guys had in terms of premium growth, you've been growing high-single digits, and the peers that we cover in the group business have been flattish. And so just looking at having taken market share, is that -- do you think it's just a symptom of what's going on with your group businesses. You've taken some share, and now as a result, you probably have some less profitable business that needs to be repriced. Or is it mainly just the employee paid business that has had much more dramatic growth and the employer paid business has been more consistent with industry trends?","Dennis R. Glass","Yes. The big driver of the increase in sales, say, since 2010 is almost 250% increase on employee paid. If you look at market share in the business, we have had a modest increase, but not a significant increase. I think we've gone from 4.2 to 5 over a 4-year period, again, most of that being driven by employee paid growth, although employer paid growth sales did grow as well. So we took a little bit of market share, and I think we keep coming back to -- there's no question that we should have gotten better prices a couple of years ago on the business, given what has unfolded with respect to the trends around disability, incidents and recoveries and size claims and so forth, a little bit on the life mortality side. So yes, we've got a little bit more share, maybe it was pricing. But when I just look internally, we knew what we were doing and it just turned out what we thought was fluctuation, and some of these key mortality and morbidity numbers appeared to us at the moment to be higher than what we were pricing for.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And -- sorry, Dennis, just to -- I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. You grew employee paid 250% over what period of time?","Dennis R. Glass","Well, let me just give you the numbers. The sales of employee paid went from $120 million in 2010 to $254 million. So I guess it's more like a doubling to $254 million in 2013. And you didn't see that kind of growth in the employer paid.","Operator","Our final question comes from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Two very, very quick questions, I think, for Randy. One, Randy, do you view debt reduction -- I don't know if you covered this or not, but do you view debt reduction as a part of the capital deployment in '14? I know you took kind of $100 million net debt out of that $700 million.","Randal J. Freitag","Actually, we pre-funded our early maturities for 2014, so there really isn't much we can do around the net debt reduction in 2014. So I think we're going to be definitely skewed towards share buybacks.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess just generally speaking, are you kind of where you want to be in terms of ratios?","Randal J. Freitag","We feel very good about where we are, significantly in that we've brought our amount of interest expense down significantly over the last few years. So we feel very good about where we are from a leverage standpoint. It's always something we've looked at, as we look at our capitals to go, but we feel very good about where we are from a leverage or coverage standpoint.","A. Mark Finkelstein - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, I think you gave some spread outlook on retirement. I'm curious, if you said it, I missed it, what is the outlook on Life Insurance in terms of spread compression for '14?","Randal J. Freitag","Yes. At these levels of investment, we'd expect mid-single digits to low-double digits, so 5 to 10, 6 to 11, somewhere in there.","Operator","And that concludes the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jim Sjoreen for final comments.","Jim Sjoreen","We want to thank you, all, for joining us this morning. As always, we can take your calls or e-mails in the Investor Relations Department. So please give me a call, and we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.

Good morning and welcome to Lincoln Financial's third quarter earnings call.","Before we begin, I have an important reminder. Any comments made during the call regarding future expectations, trends and market conditions, including comments about sales and deposits, expenses, income from operations, share repurchases and liquidity and capital resources are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn things over to Dennis.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone.","Third quarter earnings were particularly strong as we reported record operating earnings and earnings per share. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% compared to the prior year. These were high-quality results as all four of our businesses produced solid earnings and our sources of earnings were well-balanced.","Our balance sheet and capital position continue to be very strong evidenced by nearly $9 billion of statutory capital and a 10% increase in our book value per share, excluding AOCI, to almost $57. During the quarter, we also completed our comprehensive annual assumption review which had a modest impact on our financials. Given the strength of our balance sheet and our consistent capital generation, we returned more than $250 million to shareholders in the third quarter. In addition, we also announced last night that the board of directors approved a 16% increase in our quarterly dividend.","As we are all aware, macro headwinds are dampening growth for the life insurance industry and we are certainly not immune to that. However, I am pleased that across the enterprise, we are successfully responding to these challenges with short-term actions, including disciplined expense management and incremental capital management to sustain our EPS growth.","We also have additional actions underway to position us for the longer term, including pricing changes on both in-force and where-needed new business and enterprise-wide digitization initiative that will significantly enhance our customer experience and provide efficiencies over time and an intense focus on product innovation, particularly in our Annuity business, to meet evolving consumer preferences and marketplace shifts. This strategy will once again rely on our core strengths, distribution and product development.","We will update you on these initiatives as they evolve. But I am excited that each will provide us an opportunity to sustain our strong track record of financial success.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with Annuities. It was another solid earnings quarter for the Annuity business, which highlights the ongoing underlying earnings power of our in-force business, including another year of modest unlocking impacts. Our hedge program also had strong performance. Consistent with past several quarters, new business continues to be affected by various market factors. As a result, industry sales are down roughly 30% and our sales are down as well.","We continue to believe uncertainty in the capital markets is a primary driver. But we see some additional factors including shifting consumer preferences towards passive investments and choice between fee-based and commission-based compensation. Notably, sales of passive investments and fee-based advice are not currently prevalent in the VA space.","Short-term performance of risk-managed funds in V-shaped markets and some impact from the DOL, which is difficult to quantify given similar declines in both the qualified and non-qualified markets. We have an active plan to boost sales grounded in our successful long-term strategy of both expanding and developing distribution coupled with product evolution. Let me highlight some aspects of this.","First, beginning in the fourth quarter, we are improving our account value growth first value proposition by providing more choice and investment flexibility, which should offer better upside potential. Also, we are leveraging our unique i4LIFE solution which is positioned very well in the non-qualified market to provide better income outcomes. We expect these refinements to draw new advisors and improve distribution effectiveness.","Next, we see the movement towards fee-based products as a significant long-term growth opportunity as it expands our distribution reach into fee-based and registered investment advisors. There is a growing interest in fee-based annuity products. And we will be refreshing our full suite of products to meet this demand and they will be ready in early 2017.","We recently filed a VA product that creates a new product category, which is a no-load and lower-fee passive investment based VA with a simplified guaranteed income story. We are partnering with one of the leading passive investment managers to capitalize on the movement towards passive investments. We expect a gradual rollout starting in the first quarter and see a long runway for growth.","Finally, as it relates to the DOL, we have seen a major distributor narrow its shelf space leaving us in place. We expect to benefit from this trend if it continues. As a result of these actions, we expect to see momentum in the fourth quarter and further sales gains throughout next year recognizing there could be some disruption in the qualified market around DOL implementation. Ultimately, we expect to return to full-year positive net flows in 2018.","Of note, as we are building sales, we intend to buy back more stock to blunt the EPS impact of lower sales. So as we talked about at Investor Day, our Annuity book has a solid earnings foundation and strong returns because we started this business prudently and smartly from the get-go. The actions I just described will allow us to navigate the changing dynamics in the marketplace and build on our successful track record.","Turning to Life Insurance. Our earnings were robust and included mortality results that were in line with our third quarter expectations. Total Life Insurance sales in the quarter were $193 million, a 12% increase from the prior year quarter as nearly all of our product lines generated solid growth.","Included in our sales results are several noteworthy stories. Term sales at $31 million were a post-merger record and increased 55% as we continued to benefit from several product and process enhancements over the past year. The UL sales increased 11% as our strong pipeline began to convert to sales following a slow start to the year.","Index Universal Life sales increased 10% as regulations that began last September required many competitors to make significant reductions in maximum illustration rates, resulting in an improvement in our competitive position. Lastly, MoneyGuard sales increased 8% as we are benefiting from continued market demand for linked-benefit products.","Our focus on sales is not just to grow but to grow profitably with a diversified mix of products and a tilt away from long-term guarantees. This quarter, we once again achieved these objectives with expected new business returns within our target range of 12% to 15% and all individual life products representing between 10% and 30% of total Life Insurance sales. Also, 65% of our sales did not have long-term guarantees. Overall, our Life Insurance franchise continues to be strong as growth in key business drivers combined with pricing actions leave us optimistic about our ability to grow our Life business.","Turning to Group Protection. This quarter reflects our continuing progress in improving profitability and the long-term growth potential of our Group business. Consistent with recent quarters, we continue to benefit from a favorable non-medical loss ratio primarily attributable to our repricing efforts and enhancements to our claims management function. Although loss ratio results can fluctuate from one quarter to the next, we believe that our underlying experience trends are solid.","As we have noted recently, top-line growth will be critically important to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And we are clearly seeing signs of success as our premiums grew sequentially for the first time since 2014. We'll build on this growth moving forward and expect year-over-year premium growth to reemerge in 2017.","Driving our encouraging top-line momentum are improvements in sales and persistency. For the full year, our sales growth is solid, up 16% off a low sales result in 2015, while our pricing remains sound. Just as important, renewal persistency has been improving as needed price increases have moderated throughout 2016. Bottom line, I am pleased to see signs of growth reemerge while we continue to sustain our pricing and risk management discipline.","In Retirement Plan Services, earnings were consistent with recent quarters. Third quarter deposits of $1.8 billion were down 5% from a year ago due to timing of first-year sales in the mid-large market. That said, we have pointed to a strong sales pipeline which we are seeing convert to new sales. As a result, first-year sales increased 41% sequentially.","With several recent wins scheduled for fourth quarter implementation, we expect 2016's net flows to exceed 2015 levels. This quarter generated nearly $100 million of positive flows and have had positive flows in six of the past seven quarters.","Our strong results and optimistic growth outlook are being driven by several positive factors, including distribution expansion and increased wholesaler productivity in the small market, the launch of our enhanced small-market Director product which is level fee and DOL-ready, and lastly, investments in our digital and mobile customer experience that is resonating in the marketplace.","To this point, since launching our new Click-to-Contribute functionality in June, we have seen 12,000 participants take action to increase their contribution rates. These tangible outcomes, combined with our alignment to the fastest growing markets and an ability to distinguish ourselves in these markets through our high-touch service model, give us a lot of positive momentum.","Shifting to investment results, our alternative investments had a solid quarter with a 12% annualized return, above our long-term average and targeted return of 10%. Better results from both our private equity investments and hedge funds helped drive the increase over the prior quarter. We expect to further increase our alternatives' earnings over time as we continue to grow the portfolio to our long-term target of 1.5% of invested assets and further shift the mix towards private equity.","In the third quarter, we put new money to work at an average yield of 3.6%, down 20 basis points from the second quarter. The decrease in new money rates was consistent with the drop in Treasury rates as we invested approximately 200 basis points over the average 10-year Treasury. Lastly, the investment portfolio remains high quality, with below investment grade assets representing just 5.4% of our fixed income portfolio.","Before wrapping up, let me provide a few comments on the DOL as there have been a fair number of developments over the past few months. First, as we have noted, most of our distribution partners are continuing to work towards using the best interest contract exemption to serve retirement savers and will offer the choice of commissions or fees, whichever is in the client's best interest. This is the decision we made with LFN and shared with our advisors early on.","While some distributors have publicly announced their intentions, many have been slower to formally communicate their decisions. That said, if you listen to recent earnings calls, you would have heard a number of the large wirehouses imply that choice has always been fundamental to their firm's practice and they do not expect that to change.","Let me provide some specifics on what we expect. Of our 10 largest VA partners, we believe nine will use the best interest contract exemption for commissions. Also of note, 85% to 90% of the sales from our top 25 VA partners will also allow commissions.","As I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing significant interest in fee-based annuity product offerings. With fee-based annuity currently representing a small portion of industry sales, we see this as a big distribution growth opportunity. As I already mentioned, we're seeing some distribution partners narrow manufacturers and product offerings.","We expect to benefit from this given our leading wholesaler force, the breadth of our customer solutions and our consistent market presence. In fact, we are already seeing early signs of this as a leading distributor announced that effective January 1, they will be paring down the number of products and manufacturers they offer. Proudly, we have more products retained on their shelf than any other manufacturer. Once again, proof that we will be well-positioned in a post-DOL world.","So in closing, I'm pleased with our record results which include underlying EPS growth of 10%, consistent with the EPS growth targets we have provided. While clearly there are economic and regulatory issues, we are taking both short and long-term actions to manage them. Also, when I look around the industry, I continue to believe we have a clear and straightforward story. We are not in the crosshairs of dual regulation. We are not undertaking uncertain transformational changes. We are not distracted by precarious run-off businesses while our 100% domestic footprint better protects us from global macro uncertainty.","Our business model is simple. Manufacture only retail products, lead with distribution and product prep, target the fastest growing segments of the broader U.S. market, maintain industry-leading risk management and actively direct capital to the highest and best usage. Most importantly, our business model has a track record of financial success and stability. And we see opportunities to respond to market headwinds to drive further shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis. Last night, we reported income from operations of $441 million or $1.89 per share for the third quarter. Excluding notable items, EPS increased 10% year-over-year.","First, let me touch on this year's annual review of DAC and reserve assumptions. Following last year's lowering of our long-term earned rate assumption by 50 basis points, this year's annual review had a series of pluses and minuses that netted to a modest positive impact to operating earnings of $5 million or $0.02 per share.","A few comments on this year's review process. Favorable items this year included variable annuity policyholder behavior and expenses. These items more than offset the impact of lower interest rates and a 30 basis point decrease in our separate account return assumption which now stands at 7.3%.","It is also worth noting that we did not unlock a reversion to the mean corridor, which still provides a cushion against weak equity markets. So the bottom line related to our annual review is that when viewed in total, the assumptions underlined in our balance sheet continue to be sound. Outside of the annual assumption review, other notable items included a $0.02 benefit in Group Protection from a balance sheet review that I will discuss later and another $0.02 in Other Operations largely from tax adjustments.","One other item of note before shifting to key performance metrics and that is variable investment income was strong this quarter. Results ran $18 million after tax and DAC or $0.08 per share ahead of our 5-year average for prepayment-related income and our 10% return assumption on alternatives.","Moving to the performance of key financial metrics. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, now stands at $56.65, up 10% as we continue to consistently compound book value. Operating ROE was outstanding at 13.7% while our ROE through the first nine months stands just shy of 12%.","Expense discipline contributed to G&A expenses, net of amounts capitalized, declining by more than 2% in line with our full-year results. We continue to be pleased with our ability to effectively manage G&A in a period of slower growth for the life insurance industry.","Consolidated net flows were positive. And with end-of-period account values exceeding the quarterly average, we enter the fourth quarter with a slight tailwind. Our balance sheet and capital generation remain important sources of strength and it enabled us to repurchase $200 million of stock this quarter.","Lastly, net income for the quarter was $2 per share, exceeding operating EPS, driven by very strong performance from our variable annuity hedge program which reported $82 million of realized gains. Net income results also included $28 million of realized losses related to investment.","Now to business results and starting with Annuities. Reported earnings for the quarter were $240 million, down 2% from last year when excluding notable items in both periods. Net unfavorable items this quarter totaled $10 million, primarily related to lowering our separate account return assumption as policyholder behavior assumptions, which have resulted in significant charges for many of our competitors, were once again favorable.","Equity markets' strength over the past year has more than offset the negative net flows that Dennis mentioned. As a result, end-of-period account balances increased 6%, which further improved our risk profile as our guaranteed living benefit, net amount at risk, as a percentage of account value is less than 1%. Return metrics remained strong. Our ROA of 77 basis points is consistent with recent periods while ROE came in at 21%, again, an outstanding result.","So the financial impact of changes to assumptions was minimal, another testament to our established and strong foundation in the Annuity business. Earnings continue to be high quality. The business is well-managed. And we expect to build on our success in the future.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Earnings of $167 million included net favorable items of $17 million related to our annual review. Excluding notable items, earnings were consistent with the prior year period. Also included in the current quarter's results was $9 million of the favorable variable investment income I noted upfront and strong mortality experience, which largely reflected typical third quarter seasonality.","Spreads, excluding variable investment income, came in at 131 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 7 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 5 to 10 basis point expectation.","Lastly, total in-force space amount increased 5% with average account values up 4%. But both these measures are in line with recent performance and support our mid single-digit organic growth expectation.","Group Protection earnings of $28 million marked the highest quarterly earnings since 2009. Included in this quarter's result were net favorable items of $5 million from a review of disability reserves and DAC assumptions. Excluding this adjustment, our earnings increased 35% and our operating margin was 4.7%.","Our non-medical loss ratio, excluding the disability reserve refinements, improved to 70.2% from 74.5% in the prior year quarter. This 400 basis point improvement was driven by better loss experience in all product lines, Life, Disability and Dental.","As Dennis noted, top-line growth is expected to drive the next leg of our margin improvement story. And we are encouraged that non-medical premiums grew compared to the second quarter. This marked the first sequential increase in premiums in two years. Given these successes, we expect our positive momentum to continue.","In Retirement Plan Services, we reported earnings of $32 million, compared to $42 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's earnings were negatively impacted by $2 million from our annual assumption review while the prior year period benefited by $2 million.","Spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 148 basis points. Year-to-date, spreads have compressed 12 basis points compared to last year, the midpoint of our 10 to 15 basis point expectation. For the quarter, our ROA was 23 basis points, consistent with our year-to-date result.","Account values have benefited from several quarters of positive net flows. When combined with positive changes in the equity markets over the past year, end-of-period account values increased 8% to $57 billion. As our outlook for net flows remains positive, we are positioned well to further increase account values and earnings in the Retirement business.","Before moving to Q&A, let me comment on a few other items of note. As I noted upfront, our capital position remains very strong and our business model continues to generate capital, allowing us to remain one of the best capital return stories in the life insurance space. This quarter, we repurchased $200 million of Lincoln shares. And year-to-date, we have deployed 76% of our operating earnings towards buybacks and dividends, above our annual target of 50% to 55%.","We expect to remain active allocators of capital. An example of this can be seen by our announced 16% increase in our shareholder dividend. As we have noted in the past, we anticipate growing and maintaining a competitive dividend.","Our statutory surplus stands at $8.8 billion, up over $500 million from the prior year period even after sending a little over $1 billion to the holding company. We also estimate our RBC ratio will end the quarter at approximately 500%. Lastly, our holding company cash ended the quarter at $546 million.","So to conclude, we reported record operating earnings and EPS. Net income was also a record and exceeded operating income as the hedge program had an excellent quarter. We grew book value per share by 10% and our ROE approached 14%. This year's annual review had a modest positive impact on our operating earnings and enterprise expense discipline continues.","At the business level, Annuities continues to report strong returns. Earnings in our Life business reflected strong mortality experience. RPS results were consistent with recent quarters. And Group Protection posted its best earnings quarter in 7 years.","These solid results have drove consistently strong capital generation. And when you combine that with the strength of our balance sheet, it allows me to conclude my comments by stating that we expect to continue actively returning capital to shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher A. Giovanni - Lincoln National Corp.","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the Q&A session. We have about 30 minutes. And as a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and only one follow-up, then re-queue if you have additional questions. With that, let me turn it over to Charlotte to begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everybody. The first question I have is around risk-based capital and just capital supporting the variable annuity business. We've, I guess, heard on the first two calls this morning, both MET and PRU, that they may be taking or at least articulating a slightly different approach to the way they think about risk-based capital and capital supporting the VA blocks and really thinking about the targeted risk-based capital ratio of 400% for everything ex variable annuities and then thinking about variable annuity capital relative to a CTE-97 or 98 kind of level. If we thought the same way or in a similar fashion for Lincoln, what kind of impact does that have? I think given the captive, your risk-based capital at about 500% is still something we can think about relative to that 400% longer term. Is that reasonable?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, John. Thanks for the question. That's a very broad question, so let me come at it this way. When I think about how we develop capital that's appropriate for all of our businesses, I don't think about it as any different business to business. Ultimately, we're looking at the stresses that can impact each and every business. And that should ultimately drive the amount of capital that we've put behind each of those businesses. In the case of the variable annuity business, we express that with a CTE measure. And we talk about capitalizing that business to a CTE-98 measure.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Now the stresses are going to be different in a Life business, for instance, where you're primarily talking about credit stress, or an annuity business where once again you're talking about credit stress. So while these stresses or the potential impacts may be different, the fundamental underlying approach for how we develop our capital is consistent across all of the businesses. We then convey those approaches, typically, through an expression of an RBC percentage. As I mentioned, we were at 500% at the end of the quarter.","As I've said in the past, we have a very strong balance sheet. But I wouldn't anticipate taking some piece of that balance sheet and doing an outsized share buyback, for instance, in a particular quarter. I think we do have excess capital on our balance sheet if we wanted to do something like some M&A probably in the range of $500 million to $750 million. But I don't think that when you take everything like ratings into account, that we would take a similar amount of capital and suddenly put that into buybacks. That being said, we continue to do a strong amount of buybacks each and every year. And I'd point out that our shares went down nearly 8% year-over-year, indicating the strong capital return story that we have been. So, John, that's how I would think about capital that we use to support the business and how we ultimately express that as an RBC percentage.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. No, I appreciate that, Randy. That's very helpful. And my second question unrelated to the first is, if we think about mortality results in the Life Insurance segment, seasonally, 3Q tends to be more favorable than the other three quarters of the year. And just reflecting upon that relative to a typical seasonal strong 3Q, how would you characterize this quarter's results? And could you remind us how to think about the contribution in 3Q relative to the rest of the year?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Sure. I think the third Q was the better twin of the first quarter, certainly with a little different numbers in terms of the mix. If you remember in the first quarter, I talked about $30 million of negative mortality experience with roughly two-thirds of that being expected seasonality and then the other one-third being over and above that. This quarter we had roughly, in total, what I would say is about $15 million of favorable mortality over a full year's average quarter, with about two-thirds being normal seasonality and the other third being experience better than that. But if you try to break that down into percentages, the actual expected for the quarter, John, came in about 95%, 96%, I believe it was. So a good quarter all around, a quarter that wasn't unexpected as we do talk about favorable seasonality in the quarter. But, nonetheless, a very good quarter.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you, Randy.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Just had a question first on alternative investment income. It was pretty strong this quarter. So I don't think you highlighted the number that you see as sort of maybe above your expected long-term run rate. But if you could do that and then also just talk a little bit about which asset classes did well and contributed the most to that. And then I have a couple other questions.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, Jimmy. In terms of the impact, I mentioned $0.08 between prepayment income and alternatives. About one quarter or $0.02 of that was from the alternative portfolio. You know we have a long-term expectation of a 10% return in the portfolio. I think we actually came in at 12.4% for the quarter. So it was a good strong quarter. But I think it was consistent with movements in the equity markets that we've seen in prior quarters.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","If I could just follow up. About 90% of that overall number came from private equities, balanced hedge funds, but both categories performed nicely.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then you reported pretty strong margins both in Group insurance where you've been repricing and individual life. Individual life especially has been weak the last few quarters. So does this represent more of a run rate that you can improve off of or do you consider the margins in both of those businesses abnormally good this quarter?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Well, you asked about two businesses. And I just addressed the Life question. We had a good mortality quarter which benefited us by roughly $15 million. And I also mentioned that additionally we had about half of that $18 million of variable investment income, or $9 million, was located in the Life line. So overall, it was a strong quarter that featured good mortality. I would also note that when we think about seasonality, we think about it being negative in the first quarter and then getting it back in the third and fourth quarter. So our base expectation as we go into the fourth quarter is that mortality in terms of, once again, an average quarter would be a little better than that full year's average quarter.","In terms of the Group business, $28 million of earnings; I noted that $5 million of earnings came from the review of reserves and DAC. So if you took that out, you'd be at $23 million or a 4.7% margin. At the end of the day, Jimmy, it was a good quarter. If you go business by business and look at the loss ratios that we reported and if you adjusted those loss ratios for the reserve review, you would see that every line, Life, Disability and Dental, improved from the prior year and improved from the preceding quarter. So it was undoubtedly a quarter consistent with what we've talked about, which is the repricing of this business has been done and is largely behind us. And you're starting to see that feed through into the results.","When you look business by business, I would say that our strongest quarter would have been in the Life business. And when you look forward, I would \u2013 I think if you look in the stat supp, Jimmy, the loss ratio in the Life business was 66%. I'd expect that to trend up a little over time. And the adjusted loss ratio for the Disability business would have been 74%. I'd expect that to trend down a little bit over time. When you wrap it altogether, we had an adjusted loss ratio of 70.2%. I'd put that on the good side of an expected quarter for this business. And I think \u2013 if you went back to the first quarter, I talked about a 1% to 2% sort of margin around an expected mean. And I think that this quarter was on the good side of that expected mean.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then you mentioned you being \u2013 you're done with your repricing initiatives. As you're looking at year-end renewal season, how is the pricing in the market? Because we've heard from some other companies that it's starting to get a little bit more competitive now. But how is the pricing in the group benefits market?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Jimmy, it's Dennis. We're not seeing across any of our businesses any outliers. And all of our businesses, they have good, strong, tough competition. Interestingly, in some of the business lines, take for example, RPS, it's a little bit less on price and a little bit more on technology and how that technology can help both the provider and the participant. But in general, we don't see any extreme pricing, either people coming in and underpricing or anything in that arena.","Jamminder Singh Bhullar - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Gallagher, from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Dennis, I wanted to follow up on some of your DOL comments as it relates to the variable annuity business. And you talked about by 2018, you expect net flows to become positive. Can you provide a little color on how you see this playing out for yourself, for the industry a little more broadly in this context? So is your expectation that you're going to see a pretty meaningful product pivot and commission structure pivot here as it relates to a move into passives on the product side and a move to level fee sales versus the frontload commission structure that has existed historically? Or do you not see something that dramatic happening here?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","That's a good question. And I think a lot of that answer remains to be seen. What we know now and what I said during our remarks, which I know you've heard, but I'll repeat them, is that there's a big group of advisors that haven't been doing the VA business because the VA business \u2013 they've had more commission-based financial advisors than fee-based advisors. We think that's an opportunity for growth. We think there's a very significant population of financial advisors if the industry and Lincoln provides better fee-based product structures that they'll participate. So that's one direction.","Is there going to be a significant shift from commissions in the traditional marketplace where it has been commissions? Is there going to be a significant shift from commission compensation to fee-based compensation? Again, I think we have to wait and see if that's going to take place. We're focused on and I think all of our distribution partners are focused on what is in the best interest of their clients in terms of the type of fees or the type of compensation that they charge. And as we have talked about on numerous occasions; for insurance contracts where the advice cycle is mostly upfront, it seems like commissions make most sense both for the advisor who's providing the advice upfront. And it's less expensive oftentimes for the client because there's not this ongoing management fee that's really, in long-dated insurance contracts, not as necessary it is, say, for example, with an advisor who's helping with asset mix on a daily or quarterly basis.","So in the industry in general, the movement to passive investments has been pretty significant. Whether or not that continues, we'll have to see. But we want to be in a position to meet that need as well. So we'll have to see. But we think we're well-positioned no matter what direction the overall marketplace takes.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Thanks for that, Dennis. And then if I could shift to a question on the NAIC proposal to change variable annuity capital and reserving framework. Randy, any initial thoughts on this as it relates to your views on ultimately how much capital is going to be needed for this business? Do you feel well-positioned based on the way this is trending? Would you expect that maybe this could consume more capital? And any initial thoughts?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Tom, there hasn't been a lot of change since the last time we talked about this. Yes, we do feel well-positioned. In general, I think we're typically going to be supportive of changes that we see as improvement to how we account for our product. Then undoubtedly, what the NAIC in conjunction with Oliver Wyman is working on is an improvement in how variable annuities are accounted for both from a reserve and a capital standpoint. It's an improvement because it's moving from what I would describe as more of a book value approach to what I would describe as more of an economic value approach. And that is a good change because that's how we hedge the products and when we think about that risk.","So we are supportive of what Oliver Wyman is doing. We believe we are well-positioned. If you go piece by piece through the proposal, you're going to find some that are positives and some of that are negatives relative to the current approach to reserving that the NAIC has. For instance, I think linking the returns to the risk-free rates would probably be a negative. But on the other hand, hedge accounting for derivative assets is a definitive positive. When you add them all together, we continue to believe we're well-positioned.","I think one other thing that leaves me feeling very good about how we're positioned for any changes that might come about is what you see with our policyholder behavior. As I mentioned in my script, you've seen very large charges across the industry from companies who've had to bring their policyholder behavior assumptions more in line with experience. You haven't seen that at Lincoln. In fact, if you look over the last 5 years, the sum total of impacts from unlocking our policyholder behavior assumptions is a positive. It's been a positive pretty much each and every year. So I think the fact that our assumptions are well-linked to our actual experience and always have been puts us in a very good position when you think about what the NAIC is working on.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","That's helpful, Randy. And just one final one. This 7.3% separate account return assumption, that moved from 7.6% a year ago. So did you take that down 30 basis points?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yes, we did. If you remember last year, we went from 8.2% to 7.6%. And this year we went from 7.6% to 7.3% and that was primarily by doing some work on the underlying returns that go into the separate accounts. This year, it happened to be primarily on the fixed income side.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","And I presume then that you had one maybe semi-sizable adjustment negatively. Was that then offset by favorable policyholder behavior?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. In fact, the Annuity business, as we mentioned, the total was $10 million of negative results from the unlocking. That was comprised of $25 million from changing capital markets assumptions and that was primarily the reduction in the separate account return. That was offset by $15 million of positive primarily from policyholder behavior. So then that netted to the $10 million that we talked about.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay, so pretty small. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Dargan from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks. I'd like to follow up on Tom's question around DOL and Annuity sales in another way. Dennis and Randy, for the last couple of years, you've been saying that if Annuity sales fell because of changes in how the products sold due to DOL, you would use the capital that was backing those annuities and buy back more stock. We're kind of essentially there now at least in order of magnitude. Versus what I was thinking, it came a little earlier. I was thinking the fall would come in 2017. So I'm just wondering, Randy, if the stats surplus in RBC that you referenced earlier, if that's benefited at all from the lower capital strain from lower Annuity sales.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Sean, I think we've pretty much done what we said we would do. So if you look at what we've done year-to-date, we have returned 76% of operating earnings to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. That compares to a guidance of 50% to 55%. If you use the central point of that guidance and you develop how much additional buybacks over our guidance that would be, what you will see is that there's probably about $75 million in there related to lower variable annuity sales. And I would expect that to continue, should Annuity sales remain below our longer-term expectations. As Dennis mentioned, we will be working aggressively to get back to a positive flow situation. But we have been and we will continue to do what we've said which is put that capital to work through share buybacks.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And can you help us think if you do get to positive flows and the vehicle that gets you there is a fee-based annuity chassis, is the capital strain lower on selling new products with that type of product versus the commission-based chassis that you've used in the past?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, absolutely. You have less investment upfront. So what you will typically see is that, from a return standpoint, your ROEs are a little higher and your ROAs are a little lower because of the fact that you don't have as much investment and you have less capital strain.","Sean Dargan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Krueger from KBW. Your line is now open.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on the no-load passive VA that you're going to roll out. I guess, one, is that an investment-only product or does it have an income guarantee? And then secondly, are there many other passive-only VAs in the market or is yours the first or one of the first to roll out?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah. I refer to this, Ryan, as a new product category, not that elements of it aren't in the market. And we're not going to go into too much detail because it is a competitive opportunity, I think. But it's the combination of passive investment income, a simplified guaranteed living benefit and a no-load product. And again, I'm not aware of any competitive products that include all of those features.","And importantly, sort of back to the question that I was asked about, what's the direction of commissions versus fees. I think the most important answer is what's in the best interest of the customer; what's the customer's investment ideas, coming back to \u2013 or preferences, I should say \u2013 coming back to passive. At the moment, a lot of active investment moving to passive. We're just trying all the time to be responsive to major trends in the industry. I think this particular product is exciting. It has a lot of technology associated with it that makes it easier for the customer to understand the product and where it might fit into the customer's overall portfolio of investments. So we're very excited about it and we've got a great partner. And again, because it's so technology-heavy, it will take a few months to get it into the market and then connect with our different distribution partners' systems.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. And then for Randy, it seems that a lot of your peers have disclosed their long-term interest rate assumptions on a risk-free basis. I think your 5.25% is an earned rate assumption. I was just hoping you could tell us what that kind of translates into for a risk-free rate for comparison purposes.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, I think most people generally have talked about the 10-year risk-free rate and how that translates into a longer-term earned rate. For us, the underlying 10-year Treasury assumption is 3.75%. When I look around, and I do have access to some surveys and other information on the industry, I would say that that number is, in general, at the lower end of industry assumptions. I would say that the industry average is probably about 50 basis points higher than that. On the other hand, our grading period of 5 years is probably a little shorter than the average industry grading period.","I think those two items, from an economic standpoint, probably offset each other. I would prefer, or we would prefer right now, to be in a situation with the lower ultimate rate assumption because I think most evidence indicates that over the longer term, we should expect rates to be a little lower than they have historically. And we also happen to think that whatever the ultimate resolution on rates is going to be, it's going to be known inside of 5 years. We will understand that rates are going to move higher or in the next 5 years we will understand that we should lower the assumption again.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kovac from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thanks. For Randy here, I was wondering if you could share any initial thoughts, as we are in the fourth quarter, about statutory testing and lower rate utilization; anything you learned this quarter that you could share with us?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Hey, Michael. Thanks for the question. I think, as we have done in the past, our overall cash flow testing has yielded a growing efficiency over time as we add some more new business and more profitable new business than runs off our books. In terms of the things that can be variable from year to year, you're generally talking about the subtests, what are called 8C and 8D, the highly descriptive tests \u2013 8C and 8D. The rates for those \u2013 for the 8D test was locked in back at June 30. It's well-known and we don't anticipate any stress from either of those tests this year. So we feel very good about how we're positioned for cash flow testing and would not expect any additional reserves this year end.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","And Mike, I'll just then, for everybody's benefit, just add a comment that if you go to our investor presentations there is a lot of sensitivity around this question and the consequences of interest rates at different levels. If you go into the policyholder assumptions sensitivities, you can see very little \u2013 you can see what the impacts are on us. And in all cases, I think we feel like we're in a good shape.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, that's helpful. And then one for Dennis here. Appreciate all the additional color on the Department of Labor and the uncertainty that maybe still exists to some degree. I was wondering if you could give us an update in terms of any either upfront expenses or ongoing expenses that you believe you will incur as we head into April and then sort of on the go-forward.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Michael, let me bucket that for you. The most significant investment is on the distributor's part, not on the manufacturer's part. And so, yes, in our RPS business and in our Annuity business, there's some incremental investment, but it's not significant. In our own broker-dealer, which is not a large contributor to earnings, there's probably a little bit more in terms of its expenses, a little bit higher for the implementation. But I'm not aware of any significant expense item with Lincoln primarily because we're the manufacturer of related DOL.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Nothing outside of what I would describe as manageable expenses, sort of expenses that come up all the time.","Michael Kovac - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for my questions. I have a question regarding the new products that you're launching, not the passive one, but the other one that you're enhancing the investment's flexibility. For those enhanced flexibility, would you still have the volatility control features in those fund options? Or if not, would that still have any kind of living benefits associated with that product?","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Humphrey, that's a good question. And let me talk about the design of products generally. And let me put it into three categories. One, if you will, you have the investment engine and that means that you have asset allocation funds or do you have risk-managed funds or individual securities or individual mutual funds. So we make adjustments on all of the engines, if you will, that drives outcomes. The next block that you have is how does the roll-up feature work for guaranteed living benefits. And as you know, almost everyone on the phone knows, oftentimes in the market it's about 5% roll-up for income purposes. And then on the backend, you have the third important piece which is what's the identified payout, how can that identified payout be adjusted. So when looking at your questions, I can tell you that in terms of the risk-managed funds, we did build a product that doesn't rely on them. But we've also had to look carefully at those other two buckets so that when you step back and ask, is it a good consumer value and does it fit into our risk tolerances, the answer is yes on both.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So basically, it will be \u2013 you kind of broadened the investment choices without the kind of the built-in volatility control in those options. But then you kind of manage it from the roll-up perspective and the payout perspective.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I think if I heard you correctly, that's correct.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe shifting gears a little bit. In terms of the Life Insurance sales kind of like running being pretty decent, how should we think about when would you get into the capacity that you can do some reserve financing again? And on top of it, with the upcoming principal-based reserving, how will that change your need for reserve financing going forward?","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","I think with the level of Term sales we've have had this year \u2013 as Dennis noted, Term sales were up quite nicely year-over-year. I would expect that we would likely have the amount of Term business where we would look to do one next year. Don't know the exact timing on when it would be next year. But it's likely that we would have the capacity to do one next year.","Dennis R. Glass - Lincoln National Corp.","I would just add in that principal-based reserving has had a very positive effect on the reduction of the required reserves on that product. And so it, longer term, will have less need for reserve financing on Term business.","Randal J. Freitag - Lincoln National Corp.","Yeah, Dennis is absolutely right. As we look at PBR rolling out, principals-based reserve, excuse me \u2013 rolling out next year, you would see much less strain on Term insurance sales, so much less need to do reserve financings.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm not showing any other further questions and would like to turn the call back over to Chris Giovanni for closing remarks.","Christopher A.

After their prepared remarks, we will move to the question-and-answer portion of the call.","I would now like to turn the call over to Dennis.","Dennis Glass","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong start to the year and momentum is building into the second quarter as we effectively execute on key management initiatives. In the first quarter, all four business segments grew operating revenues. We had very strong sales growth and 9% increase in both adjusted operating earnings per share and book value per share, excluding AOCI.","Our strength in sales was broad-based and highlights actions taken to maximize our diverse product portfolio in attractive fast-growing segments of the market and leverage our powerful distribution franchise, a competitive advantage for Lincoln, to drive profitable top line growth. Notably, the near-term sales outlooks remains encouraging. Most of our businesses also saw expense ratios improve as we continue to focus on expense efficiency through process redesign and expanding digital capabilities. We also deployed over $300 million of capital through buybacks and dividends during the quarter and are well positioned to continue to fund new business growth at attractive returns while remaining committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders.","Now turning to our business segments, starting with annuities. Operating income of $250 million decreased from the prior year quarter predominantly from the impact of the Athene transaction. Our strategic decision to broaden the product portfolio and participate in more segments of the marketplace enabled another quarter of robust and diversified sales as we continue to reach additional advisers and customers. This resulted in sales increasing 39% to $3.5 billion with net inflows of nearly $0.5 billion while continuing to achieve our profitability targets. Fixed annuity sales momentum continued as we benefited from shelf space expansion and increase in bank wholesalers and some customized FIA products. Sales of $1.6 billion more than tripled over the prior year quarter as every distribution channel generated sales gains, including significant growth in the bank and broker-dealer channels.","Variable annuity sales totaled $1.9 billion as sales of VAs without living benefits, which include our indexed variable annuity, increased 47% compared to the prior year. Although sales of VAs with living benefit guarantees decreased, sales momentum increased during the quarter and we expect sales to improve sequentially in the second quarter. So a strong start for the annuity business as sales increased significantly and we delivered another quarter of positive net flows. Looking ahead, we expect growth in our more balanced mix of sales to continue. And when combined with equity market strength, we are well positioned for operating income to improve.","In Retirement Plan Services, operating income decreased $4 million over the prior year quarter on lower and variable investment income and spread income. Total deposits in the quarter of $2.5 billion were up 6% from a year ago with growth coming from both first year sales and recurring deposits. Our high-touch, high-tech service model continues to resonate in our target markets and drive increases in participation and higher contribution rates. In addition, product innovation and customer experience capabilities provide new avenues for growth going forward. Net flows for the quarter were negative $381 million and included a large case termination of approximately $800 million. This mark the first quarter of net outflows in over 3 years. Although results can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, sales momentum coupled with low termination rates leads to a positive outlook on net flows moving forward. Continued investment in distribution, product innovation and digital capabilities give our retirement business a solid foundation for future top and bottom line growth.","Turning to Life Insurance. Growth in operating income was solid, up 9% from the prior year. Sales in the quarter were up 10%, highlighting the benefits of our broad product portfolio. We saw strong growth in Executive Benefits, Term, IUL and UL sales allowing us to overcome declines in MoneyGuard and VUL. Strategically, we continue to focus on penetrating faster-growing segments of the marketplace where we are underrepresented, including Term and IUL. The Life business got off to a great start this year and the outlook remains solid as we expect sales momentum to continue with strong bottom line results.","Turning to Group Protection. Operating income increased 90% over the prior year quarter, driven by the Liberty acquisition. First quarter sales more than doubled, also attributable to the acquisition, which resulted in growth in all product lines and both employer and employee paid sales.","We remain optimistic about our ability to increase premiums by sustaining persistency and driving sales growth, given our increased scale, broader distribution access and expanded capabilities. We are pleased with another solid quarter for Group Protection. The integration remains on track with expense synergies developing ahead of our original expectations and profit margins emerging positively and well within our target range.","Shifting to investment results. During the quarter, we invested $5 billion in an average pretax yield of 4.4%. Our fixed income portfolio yield decreased just 1 basis point. The alternatives investment portfolio had a modest 1% return in the quarter. As you know, private equity results are recorded on a 1 quarter lag, so the decline in equity markets and energy prices at the end of 2018 negatively impacted performance.","Hedge fund returns, which are reported on a 1 month lag, were strong, providing a partial offset. Given the equity market strength year-to-date, we expect significant improvement from our alternatives in the second quarter and continue to target our long-term pretax return of 10%. Overall, the investment portfolio remains in great shape. We continue to focus on managing credit risk more defensively with below-investment-grade assets representing just 4.1% of our fixed income portfolio and minimal credit losses.","In closing, I am pleased with our solid start to the year and the positive sales and operating income momentum we are carrying forward. Notably, organic growth drivers are strong as annuity sales gains should sustain positive net flows. RPS has consistently demonstrated its ability to grow deposits and net flows. Life Insurance sales are benefiting from product actions and distribution capabilities to grow and diversify our sales mix. And group sales, combined with good persistency, are resulting in steady premium growth. In terms of operating income tailwinds, equity market growth and an increase in the number of fee days in subsequent quarters should boost sources of earnings from fees on assets under management. As I noted, we also expect significant improvement in returns on alternative investments. Mortality experience is typically better over the remainder of the year and our expense saving initiatives will continue to contribute more meaningfully to results.","2019 is shaping up to be another successful year, and we will use our upcoming Investor Day to provide more insight on why we are confident we can sustain our strong results.","I will now turn it over to Randy.","Randal Freitag","Thank you, Dennis. First quarter reflects many of the themes that we have exhibited for nearly a decade. Strong top line performance with all 4 business showing revenue growth and total operating revenues up nearly 20% over the prior year quarter, boosted by last year's acquisition. Expense discipline as expense ratios improved in 3 of our 4 businesses and a strong balance sheet with book value per share, excluding AOCI growing 9%, allowing us to reduce our average diluted share count by 7%. Bringing together these items drove adjusted operating income of $441 million or $2.14 per share for the quarter, a 9% increase from the prior year and a 12.6% adjusted operating return on equity.","There were no notable items within the current or prior year quarter. However, there were a few items that resulted in some variability within the businesses. The net impact of these items was 0, and I will speak to some of these within the business segments. Net income totaled $252 million in the quarter as we experienced more below the line volatility than we have historically reported. Importantly, the vast majority of the difference between our adjusted operating income and net income was the result of $143 million in items we would consider to be noneconomic with the impact primarily coming from the Athene transaction, where changes in fair value for most of the asset portfolio run through the balance sheet while the offsetting change runs through the income statement. Over time, this noneconomic impact will reverse and subside.","Excluding the noneconomic impacts, net income represented 90% of adjusted operating income as the VA hedge program performed well, credit losses were minimal and acquisition and integration expenses were consistent with our expectations. ","Now turning to segment results, starting with annuities. Reported operating income for the quarter was $250 million compared to $267 million in the prior year quarter. The most significant item impacting first quarter results was the reinsurance transaction completed with Athene, which reduced operating income by $14 million. Return metrics remained strong with ROA at 79 basis points and a ROE of 21%. Risk metrics were also solid and benefited from the growth in equity markets as net amount at risk sits at 1% of account value for living benefits and less than 7\/10 of 1% for death benefits.","G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized were essentially flat year-over-year, which contributed to an 80 basis point improvement in the expense ratio. End-of-period account values were $130 billion, 3% higher than average account values in the first quarter. When combined with our strong sales momentum and additional fee days in subsequent quarters, the annuities business is well positioned to continue to provide outstanding results. In Retirement Plan Services, we reported operating income of $39 million compared to $43 million in the prior year quarter. The primary driver of the decline was lower alternative returns and spread income. Positive net flows of $1.7 billion over the trailing 12 months drove average account values to $70 billion, up 3%. G&A expenses net of amounts capitalized decreased 1% for the quarter. When combined with an increase in operating revenues, the expense ratio improved 40 basis points compared to the prior year.","Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, compressed 12 basis points versus the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations. Similar to the annuities business, end-of-period account values are 3% higher than average account values. This, coupled with the recovery in alternatives, should serve as positive drivers for the Retirement business.","Turning to our Life Insurance segment. Operating income of $157 million increased 9% from the prior year quarter. The most significant items impacting operating income in the quarter included $25 million of favorable mortality. As you know, within our annual mortality expectation, we typically see elevated experience in the first quarter. However, results were less adverse than expected. Largely offsetting this favorable mortality experience were weak results out of our alternative investment portfolio. Underlying drivers were solid with average Life Insurance in-force up 4% over the prior year quarter and average account values increasing 2%.","Expense ratio remains stable, and we had $15 million of favorable amortization expenses in the quarter. Base spreads, excluding variable investment income, were down 6 basis points year-over-year at the low end of our expectations. So a great start to the year for the Life business. We are particularly encouraged given mortality is typically better over the remainder of the year, and we expect significant improvement in returns on alternative investments. Group Protection reported operating income of $55 million compared to $29 million in the prior year quarter with the increase primarily coming from the Liberty acquisition. Consistent with prior first quarters, we did experience elevated DAC amortization of approximately $11 million. This due to the fact that the first quarter represents our largest renewal period.","Overall, business trends remained positive, which resulted in an after-tax margin of 5.4%. The loss ratio in the first quarter was 73.7% as risk results continue to be favorable. Better loss experience in disability from lower incidents was partially offset by higher average claim size in group life. As a reminder, the year-over-year increases in loss ratios reflect the impact of the acquisition as we combined 2 blocks of business with different loss characteristics. It was another excellent quarter for Group Protection. While there can always be volatility quarter-to-quarter, our pricing and claim management fundamentals are sound and trending well and the Liberty integration continues to be on a positive trajectory. These favorable factors should enable us to sustain margins within our 5% to 7% target range.","Turning to capital and capital management. Statutory surplus stands at $9.6 billion and our RBC ratio ended the quarter at approximately 445%. Holding company cash ended the quarter at $481 million, slightly above our $450 million target. During the quarter, we returned $316 million of capital to shareholders. Share buybacks totaled $240 million, which included the remaining $90 million from our accelerated share repurchase program that we commenced in December as part of the Athene deal. In total, the Athene transaction allowed us to deploy $450 million into share buybacks at an average price of $58 per share, bringing average share count down 4%.","To conclude, an excellent first quarter from Lincoln. Adjusted operating EPS increased 9%, consistent with our long-term target. Book value per share excluding AOCI was up 9% to $68.79, an all-time high. Adjusted operating ROE was 12.6%. Revenue growth was strong while expense discipline remains a continued focus. And we are investing in new business growth at attractive returns while also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders.","Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue delivering this type of financial results, which will help drive long-term shareholder value.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Chris.","Christopher Giovanni","Thank you, Dennis and Randy. We will now begin the question-and-answer portion of the call. [Operator Instructions].","With that, let me turn the call back to the operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just wanted to start with RPS in the large case termination that you had talked about. Any color on what drove that? Was it M&A or pricing? And then just thoughts on overall competition in the RPS market.","Dennis Glass","Yes. Suneet, you mentioned it. That was an outcome of an acquisition or a merger. And oftentimes, not always, the acquiring company who had a different provider than the acquired company will win in that situation. So that's what it was, M&A and our customer, the smaller client and we lost the business. Now we did bid on it, but we couldn't match the other pricing.","Overall, competitive environment. I guess I'd come back to where we participate first. We're active in the small case 401(k) market. We focus on education, government markets and healthcare. We have good market positions in those cases. Competition and pricing is tough, but we think with what we bring to the table with our strategy, we can continue to do very well.","Suneet Kamath","Got it. And then just pivoting over to Group Protection. We've been hearing a lot about voluntary benefits. Some companies talking about price competition there, particularly in certain lines. So can you give us some color in terms of what you're seeing in terms of new business, particularly on the voluntary side?","Dennis Glass","Yes. I think I would answer the question a little more broadly. We think the pricing in both employee paid and voluntary is rational. We don't see any irrational pricing, to say it the other way. So we'll continue to do well in both those markets. The Liberty acquisition gives us an opportunity to increase employee sales because they had less of that in their mix. So it's a big opportunity for us going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Could you give a sense of how meaningfully VA sales improved during the quarter as market normalize?","Dennis Glass","Yes. Let me talk in terms of the percentage of sales. So back in January, we were selling fixed annuities and variable annuities at about 50-50. The mix was 50-50. By the end of April, that has switched from 50-50 to 2\/3 variable annuity sales and 1\/3 fixed annuity sales. And so that's the trend that we expect to continue and they're up overall so far total sales.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then on -- in Group Protection, expenses look to improve a fair amount. Randy, could you just give a sense of, I guess, where you are at this point relative to your expense save guidance?","Randal Freitag","Sure, Ryan. If you remember, we talked about exiting 2018 at a run rate of 75 and expecting to exit 2019 at a run rate of roughly 100 and then adding to that in 2020 and beyond. I'd say we're at a run rate now of roughly 80, right on track to get to our goal of a run rate of 100 by the end of the year. I think the group business did have a really good quarter from an expense management standpoint and executing on the synergies which we talked about. I think there may have been a little bit of timing in their expenses, but nothing that I would consider to be really out of line with outside of just good overall expense management and execution.","Operator","And our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.","Elyse Greenspan","My first question is on the annuities business. You did obviously had stronger sales in fixed and VA in the quarter, but you did mention strong sales momentum and you'll get some additional fee days in subsequent quarters. So what I'm trying to -- the outlook seems better overall for sales in that business than when you announced the Athene transaction. So I'm wondering if you will be able to earn back the earnings that you lost from that reinsurance block deals sooner than you might have expected? Can you just update us on some thoughts there?","Dennis Glass","When we did the deal, we always anticipated that we'd replace the sold liabilities in a 24-month period or so, maybe 36 months. And because of the increasing results that we've seen, better than what we had anticipated, that might come back a little bit quicker.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. Can you quantify that or just want to wait and see?","Dennis Glass","It's difficult to quantify because as you saw last year -- or excuse me, last quarter, the split between fixed annuities and variable annuities was different than it is today. Some of that is consumer preference. Some of that is capital market impacts decision for consumer and the financial advisers are recommending. But let me just say we don't think that -- obviously differently, we will replace that income in a reasonable amount of time.","Elyse Greenspan","Okay. And then my second question on the group business. Did the late flu season benefit your results in the quarter? Just some color there will be great.","Randal Freitag","Elyse, thanks for the question. I think as I noted, our very strong loss ratio in the quarter featured lower incidents in the disability side and then a little higher claim severity on the Life side. I don't think that was specifically related to the nature of the flu season. I think it's just overall consistent with what we typically or oftentimes we'll see in the first quarter. I don't think there was anything outstanding about the flu season and its impact on our group business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.","Thomas Gallagher","First question, just on the net income volatility you saw this quarter, and I think you referenced that was related to the reinsurance transaction. Can you comment whether you would expect that to remain higher level of volatility going forward? Or should we expect that to come down over time?","Randal Freitag","Tom, thanks for the question. I think as I said at the end of my paragraph on that particular topic, I said we expect it to reverse and subside. So the amount we had in the first quarter, which was $94 million associated with that transaction, that will reverse and it should subside. Why will it subside? It will subside as Athene repositions the asset portfolio. The size of it just had to do with the change in interest rates in the first quarter and the amount of the assets that still remain in an available for sale classification, which give -- gave you a fairly large change, a positive change in the unrealized gain. That positive change in the unrealized gain which runs through our balance sheet, we don't own the economics of that business, so obviously that has to get reversed out. Where it gets reversed out is through net income. It's -- I've asked a number of accountants about this. It's both noneconomic and bad accounting, but that's just the reality. And as I said, it will reverse and subside.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And Randy, that's GAAP only, not statutory, correct?","Randal Freitag","Correct.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. Just on the mortality experience. I think in 4Q, Individual Life had some adverse experience and it looks like you pretty much recovered all of that and then some with the favorable in 1Q. And I think -- if I'm correct, I think what you're essentially normalizing to now seems to be somewhat higher level than I recall for 1Q. Is that a fair observation? And also, can you talk a bit about how you see Individual Life playing out throughout the balance of the year? And the reason I'm asking is I -- at least my -- the way I was perceiving your Individual Life results last year was pretty favorable. But if I'm taking your 1Q run rate, maybe you're assuming some continued favorability or continued similar level of margins that you had last year. But anyway, sorry for the long-winded question, but any thoughts there.","Randal Freitag","No problem, Tom. We are very happy with the first quarter. As I mentioned, it was $25 million last year in the first quarter. That was roughly $5 million. Now that's relative to our expectations. And as I've talked about before, we do have seasonality in our mortality -- in our Individual Life mortality expectations. That seasonality at a high level is typically 110% in the first quarter, 100% in the second quarter and roughly 95% and 95% in the third and fourth quarter. So that's how the seasonality typically plays out in our business. Now of course, we've got a big business and can move around inside those longer-term expectations.","So with that 110% expectation in the first quarter, we did better than that. We did better than that to the tune of $25 million, as I mentioned. I don't think it changes our longer-term expectations on mortality. As I've said before, if you look back over the 8 years, you can -- every year, we're within 1% of 100, either above or below or exactly at 100 with the exception of 1 year, which I was at the caveat, which was 2015 when we had a bad second quarter, my recollection is. So nothing has changed about our longer-term expectations. The one thing we know is that we will have volatility quarter-to-quarter. But when you look over longer periods of time like a year, you tend to find a strong reversion to that mean of 100%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar from JP Morgan.","Jamminder Bhullar","So first for Randy, just on spreads. In both the annuity and retirement businesses, your spreads have been down even if we exclude alternate investment income. So just any comments on what your expectations are? And to the extent that you can quantify where your new money yield stand with the drop in interest rates recently or so far this year versus where the sort of yields are on the bonds that are going off the books? And when do you expect the spread compression to abate?","Randal Freitag","Jimmy, I think if you look at those two businesses and the annuity business, there is no spread pressure. We have plenty of flexibility to manage spreads. You will see quarter-to-quarter volatility. But over time, you will see a strong consistency to our annuity spreads. In fact, if you look year-over-year, we're at 1.56% this year. This is excluding variable investment income versus 1.55% last year, so very consistent with our longer-term expectations. In the Retirement business, we were down 12 basis points year-over-year as I noted in my script. We have a guidance out there of 10 to 15, so we're at the lower end of that. I think looking forward, we would expect that number to continue to decline over the next couple of years before it eventually disappears. I think in terms of the new money yields, as Dennis mentioned, I think we're at 4.40% in the quarter. And Dennis, if you have anything there to add?","Dennis Glass","So we're at 4.40% in the quarter. Rates dropped off a little bit, Jimmy, so that might be lower as we speak today. Fixed income book yield is 4.65%. We will go into greater detail at the investor conference around the issue of what's rolling off, what the new investment rate is and when we expect to see spread compression completely abate.","Jamminder Bhullar","And if I remember correctly, I think you have a lot of higher yielding securities that are maturing this year, right? So beyond this year, the impact of spread compression, assuming stable interest rates, abates a little bit purely for that reason.","Dennis Glass","You're exactly right, Jimmy.","Jamminder Bhullar","And then just one more on the variable annuity business. You mentioned you expect an improvement in sales in 2Q. Seasonally, Q2 tends to be stronger for the industry overall. But are there other reasons for you sounding optimistic on sales-related decline a decent amount on a sequential basis.","Dennis Glass","Are you talking about individual annuity sales or just variables?","Jamminder Bhullar","Yes, variable annuity sales.","Dennis Glass","Yes. Variable annuity sales, again, for some reason, the mix between fixed and variable in the last quarter was different than it is in April and we've seen that mix change going forward. So same comments that we've been making. Our index variable annuity is continuing to gain traction with both new distribution partners and then bringing financial advisers in. So that would create a spike, and we're adding in our other product lines additional distribution. I mentioned in the fixed annuity line, we've added some IMOs and provided some customized products. So it's really very much us taking advantage of the strength of our distribution, participating in segments of the annuity market, both fixed annuity that we hadn't been in before. And that's why we think over the next couple of years, we can drive better total annuity growth than what the industry averages would be.","Operator","And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Just to follow-up on annuity sales. You've talked about, in April, the mix is 2\/3 VA, 1\/3 fixed annuities. That's the, I think, the mix that you're expecting going forward. But I guess from a longer-term perspective, is that the desirable mix that you would like to pursue for your annuity business?","Dennis Glass","Yes. Humphrey, that's a very good question. And when you ask that question, there's a lot of considerations. So -- and let me just say, as between fixed annuities and variable annuities, you have to manage ROA because they're different for both. You have to manage ROE because they're different for both. And then as we've discussed over the long term, we have managed the balance of long- and short-term liabilities. So all of those considerations go into where we're putting our efforts. To some extent, the market is going to determine what the gross sales of the 2 products are. But within our system with -- the strength of our distribution permits us to migrate, to some extent, the sales to the categories that we want them in to maximize ROA -- ROE and achieve our balance of short term -- short- and long-term liabilities.","Humphrey Lee","I appreciate the deeper color. And then a question for Randy. In Group Protection, I was just wondering can you talk about the progress of the repricing efforts that you have on the Liberty block? And how should we think about that going forward as we progress?","Dennis Glass","Yes. I think I'll take that one, and let me just start to say -- the comment by saying we're well ahead of expectations on this. Let me give you some specifics on that. We had to reprice about $1.8 billion in premiums. We have already repriced $1.4 billion in premiums. On the repricing of that $1.4 billion, we had about 7% increase in rate on the business that stayed, and we've got an improvement including both the improvement from the lower margins on what left plus the higher margins on what stayed of about 7%. So that when you do the math on all of that, we picked up about $70 million of earnings from the repricing already. Some of that is showed up in 2018. The balance will show up in 2019 and 2020. We have the $400 million left to reprice. We expect we'll still get sort of similar results on that.","The other comment I would make is that at the time of the presentation of the Liberty merger, we indicated that it would take 2-, 3-year cycles to get all of the pricing that we needed. Actually, we're pleased because what repricing started before, Lincoln was involved, was very helpful. And now we think at the end of this first cycle, we're essentially done on repricing.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","Randy, I guess, first question. I'll start with a comment. I think we all really appreciate the simplicity of the earnings and the lack of notable items, I guess, on a consolidated basis that's the case. I guess I just -- I'd ask for your help maybe a little bit more in terms of quantifying the larger offsetting items. I mean I think, obviously, variable investment income or alternative investment income was low. Mortality was favorable. There were some DAC items and maybe a little bit of tax rate. I guess I'll just ask for your help in quantifying some of these larger items that netted zero.","Randal Freitag","No problem, John. As I mentioned in my script, as we see them, they add up to 0. So what are those items that add up to zero? Items in the Life business included, as I mentioned, $25 million of favorable mortality in Life and then $15 million of favorable amortization expenses, which just has to do with experience coming in better than our assumptions in the model. So that's $40 million on the positive side of the ledger.","On the negative side, you have the lower alt returns, which across the entire organization was $29 million. $21 million of that occurs in the Life business and the another $8 million is primarily in retirement and annuity with a little bit in group. Additionally, you have the $11 million of elevated group DAC amortization, $40 million positives, $40 million of negatives, you get back to 0. I think there have been some questions. I was reading some of the notes on the tax rate.","I don't really see much there, so let me go over that. When tax reform was enacted, we guided to a 15% to 17% range. I think as you look at last year, so the full year 2018, we came in right at 15%, so the very low end of that range. And inside of that full year, what you will see is that, all else being equal, the first quarter, we'll have our lowest effective tax rate. Why will it ever lowest effective tax rate? It's because the tax preference items are largely at level over the year, whereas the pretax income is typically lowest in the first quarter because of a lot of the seasonal items I've talked about. Higher Individual Life mortality, fewer fee days, and the annuity in the retirement business, et cetera, et cetera. So we feel like last year, we had 13.9% effective tax rate in the first quarter. This year, we're at 13%. That small difference, I would attribute it we had a small amount of DRD true-up 3 million spread across three businesses. And I would note that there were other small items, I think, that went against that and then you had a little bit of other benefit, but very small numbers. Did that help, John?","John Nadel","I understand your point. Absolutely. Yes, it is helpful, Randy. And then I understand the accounting that has this sort of geography differential between your AOCI and the realized gain\/loss impact on the Athene coinsured portfolio or reinsured portfolio. But I guess what I'm having trouble understanding is why -- what's going to -- what is actually going to cause that to reverse. Mechanically, what -- when is that going to happen? And what does that?","Randal Freitag","Sure. So as I mentioned, it comes about because a significant amount of the portfolio, which we transferred to Athene, is still classified as available for sale, which -- and which unrealized gains and losses run through the balance sheet and there was an unrealized gain in the first quarter. Now we can't have the economics of that because we don't own the business anymore, so there's this offsetting entry. ","So what can cause it to reverse? There are a number of things. If the unrealized gain went back down in the next quarter, that would be one way you would get the opposite impact. If the assets were held until maturity, of course, the unrealized gain would drift away. And over time, you would see the offsetting entries or if and when Athene repositions the asset portfolio. Because when they do reposition, that available for sale asset becomes a trading asset. And of course, with the trading asset, the changes in value run through the income statement just like the offsetting entry. So did that help, John?","John Nadel","Yes. That's hopeful. And I've got one last quick one. It's just looking at the $1.6 billion of fixed and indexed annuity deposits in the quarter, is there really any true fixed deferred annuities in there? Is that almost entirely or entirely fixed indexed annuities? And is all of that under the coinsurance arrangement with Athene?","Dennis Glass","Yes. So if you talk about SPIAs and in that one category -- it's about $180 million. The rest is in fixed rate, fixed index about $1.4 billion. And of that $1.4 billion, I think that there's about $600 million -- $500 million associated in the quarter with the Athene transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","Apologies if I missed it, but on prior calls you talked about evaluating block transaction for the life and annuity book to free up capital. Is that something you're continuing to do?","Dennis Glass","Yes. We look at every opportunity to advance shareholder value. And so those kinds of ideas remain under analysis. Whether or not they would mature into a transaction, we won't comment one way or the other.","John Barnidge","Okay. And then my follow-up. Sales across the border are strong. Is it your opinion that rumors of the economy's slowdown have been greatly exaggerated? Or is there anything you're seeing that gives you pause either in the distribution channel, customer demand or anything else?","Dennis Glass","I'll leave predicting the growth of the economy to the experts. I will say though that it's [indiscernible] from the insurance business, what's more important is the flow of wealth and the change in who's getting the wealth. And we'll show some statistics on this at our investor meeting. There's a lot of people going into the cohorts that we sell to, a lot of wealth coming out of retirement plans and going into the hands of the cohorts of age that we sell to. So I think that drives our long-term opportunities more so than the ebb and flow of GDP.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","How much further scope do you see to expand distributions for annuities or life products? And do you see any other potential opportunities similar to what you're able to do with Allstate? Or are there other large distributors where you're not on the shelf currently?","Dennis Glass","Well, in the annuity business, the only PNC company that we are now selling with is Allstate, so there'd be opportunities there. I think we have the opportunity to penetrate further in the annuity business on just about every channel that we participate in. We're talking some -- to some additional banks at the moment. So I think there's more opportunity in places where we are not to get more sales.","And when you go over to the individual business, and Randy can speak to this, but we ought to have -- we're the major player in Life Insurance in the United States other than the mutual companies. And so we should have a significant segment of every -- we have a significant share of every segment, and we typically do, except in the individual -- excuse me, in IUL marketplace or 17th out of 20, I think. So there is an example where -- and that happens to be the biggest market for Life Insurance sales in the United States. And Randy is going to correct me if I misspeak here, but there's an opportunity to really increase our position. We've introduced a new product and an example of the kind of things that we're trying to do. And Randy, I'm sorry I'm speaking on your behalf.","Randal Freitag","No. I don't disagree. Erik, thanks for the question. I think on the Life side, it's more a function of products and markets that we may not be fully participating. And so I'll give you a couple of examples, because there's a connection somewhat to distribution in there, term insurance. We're a little underrepresented in the aggregator space. And Will and his team are doing a great job of getting us onto some of those platforms. We're a little underrepresented in the smaller faced term market, and we're doing things like with the TermAccel product to be better represented. That all came together and really strong Term sales growth in the first quarter.","As Dennis mentioned, we are also underrepresented in the indexed UL space, and we did come out with a couple of products in February to improve that position. And I think that will -- with those products, which represent an improvement. From a competitive standpoint, that should give us access to some markets and distribution channels where those products are sold. But broadly speaking, Dennis is absolutely correct. With the size of our life business, the broadness of our product portfolio, we have a pretty strong representation among the people who sell Life Insurance.","Erik Bass","And then questions on group persistency. If you can comment on trends there. And I know you called out in group that amortization was a bit higher. And is that due to lapses? Or is it more just kind of reissue activity where you're -- there's no sort of impact on the forward earnings of the business?","Dennis Glass","Yes. Our combined block persistency is holding pretty steady. It's may be down a little bit first quarter, but not anything to worry about. And Randy, I'll turn over the question on this -- the...","Randal Freitag","I couldn't agree more. I think, absolutely, our overall persistency is right in line with our expectations. Inside of there, there are some subsegments where you may have had a little worst persistency, for example. We have an old voluntary book arising from the old Lincoln portfolio where persistency was a little worse than expected. And that drove actually some of the higher-than-expected DAC amortization. But overall, I think persistency continues to run right in line with our expectations. And we, in fact, have not seen the shock lapses that we priced into the Liberty deal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","Just kind of following up on the group. You had a pretax -- an after-tax margin of 4.8% versus the guided 5% to 7%. And if I took the midpoint of that 5% to 7%, that would imply close to $50 million of additional earnings pickup probably due to the repricing and the expense savings on the Liberty acquisition. So I think, Randy, you mentioned another $20-or-so million coming on the expense side. I think Dennis was talking a little bit about continued benefits from repricing. So should I assume that repricing and the expenses just get another $50 million in pickup over the course of the next year? Or is there more than that? Do we get closer to the 7%?","Randal Freitag","Andrew, I believe that what you are using in your denominator is total revenues. And when we talk about margins, what we use in our denominator is premiums. So the margin in the first quarter -- which is an industry standard, by the way. The margin in the first quarter was 5.4%. I think as both Dennis and I have said, we expect over the long term to be between 5% and 7%. But given our improved scale, given the synergies that we've come in, we expect we can move to the upper half of that range. So another 1% would be another $10 million of earnings a quarter or so, so...","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. So maybe another 40-ish to go. That's helpful. And then I know there was a lot of talk on the call about yields and so forth, but maybe you can help me just a little bit with the trajectory in the annuity business, which is the biggest spread area. You went from a yield of 3.99% to 4.02%. You went from a crediting rate, and I suspect this is due to the Athene transaction of 2.31% to 2.41%. So the spread shrank by 7 basis points. And I'm just kind of wondering where -- I think, Randy, you said that there's no spread pressure. You expect it to be consistent. Where should I be expecting the spread to go? And maybe you could give a little trajectory on the yield and the credited interest.","Randal Freitag","Andrew, I have a phrase where I say the latest is the greatest. And so I think I wouldn't move too far from what we reported in the quarter, which was 1.56% and -- which as I mentioned earlier, was very level with the year ago quarter. So I'm going to stick with my, the latest is the greatest.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs.","Taylor Scott","So I wanted to ask you about the FASB changes that are coming in, and I know it's probably still far too early to talk about specific book value transition impact and specific volatility. But I guess, just knowing investors have sort of appreciated Lincoln's simpler sort of reporting structure, consistency of earnings, et cetera. When you think about that volatility that we sort of know is on the horizon, what are the levers that you're looking at that are sort of on the table to maybe put you in a better position as you get closer to that, whether it's uses of reinsurance, different hedging strategies, different product structures? Any color you can provide.","Randal Freitag","Alex, I think we're too far off to give you any specifics within aside. I appreciate your comment that investors appreciate our consistency of results. That's absolutely been what we've shown over the years. I wish it was reflected a little better in the valuation of the company at as an aside, I think, Alex, you are going to see us use all the levers, everything we have at our disposal to manage our way through the implementation of the accounting guidance. And I think when we get through it, well, yes, there may be a little noise. We're still working on getting there. I think you will see a similar Lincoln to what you have seen in the past, which is a company, which has high quality results, returns and consistency above our peers. And that's our expectations, and we will use all the tools we have at our disposal to get there.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today's conference. If there is any one left with any questions, the company will be able to follow-up with you later in the afternoon.
