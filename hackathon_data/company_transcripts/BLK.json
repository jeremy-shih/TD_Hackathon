My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results while our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.","In addition as we have previously discussed, our first quarter 2018 financials reflect a recent adoption of FASB\u2019s new revenue recognition accounting standard which became effective on January 1. The only significant change relates to the presentation of certain distribution costs, which were previously netted against revenues and are now presented as an expense on a gross basis. For 2017, the new standard resulted in a net gross up of approximately $1.1 billion to BlackRock revenue, a corresponding process to expand and no material impact to as adjusted operating income or as adjusted operating margin. In order to simplify historical comparisons of current and future results, we adopted the new standard on a full retrospective basis and filed an 8-K in late March with recapped quarterly results for 2016 and 2017. All year-over-year and sequential financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to these recast financials.","After a strong start to the year driven by optimism related to U.S. tax reform and global economic growth, markets reversed in February and March at escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattened yield curve cause investors to pull back. Despite this increased market volatility, BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results once again demonstrate the value of the investments we have made to assemble the industry\u2019s leading global investment and technology platform. The diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of market environments helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. Paced by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter representing 4% annualized organic asset growth and 5% annualized long-term organic base fee growth as quarterly organic asset growth reflected strong higher fee global retail flows.","First quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 16% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 20%. Earnings per share of $6.70, was up 28% compared to a year ago driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $10 million of net investment gains. Recall that net interest expense in the first quarter of 2017 included $14 million of call premium expense associated with a debt refinancing. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 20% and included a $56 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We now estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring of discrete items and the issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of recently enacted tax reform legislation. First quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 17% year-over-year driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth of 7% over the last 12 months. Sequentially base fees were up 2% reflecting a lower day count compared to the fourth quarter.","Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies including Aladdin Risk for Wealth and Cachematrix resulted in 19% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology and risk management revenue. Demand remained strong for our full range of technology and risk management solutions which contributed again to both technology revenue and base fees. Today\u2019s growth is a result of the investments we have made over time and we continued to invest in our business to create more opportunity for the future. Total expense increased 13% year-over-year driven by higher compensation, G&A and volume related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $101 million or 10% year-over-year driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income, partially offset by approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform during the prior year period. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 2% due to lower incentive compensation primarily resulting from seasonally lower performance fees, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock based compensation expense related to new 2018 grants.","G&A expense was up $87 million year-over-year reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories including costs associated with MiFID II, but was also impacted by higher acquisition related fair value adjustments, product launch costs and FX re-measurement expense versus a year ago. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $67 million in the fourth quarter reflecting in part seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense and reduced professional fees. Beginning this quarter, we are providing additional detail on both G&A and distribution and servicing costs which can be found on Page 8 of our earnings release. Direct fund expenses was up $55 million or 27% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise.","Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 44.1% was up 150 basis points versus the year ago quarter which included expense associated with our active equity platform repositioning. We continued to be margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We previously announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.88 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $335 million worth of common shares in the first quarter. As we finalize the impact of tax reform on BlackRock, we intend to review our capital management plans for the balance of 2018 with our Board of Directors in the coming months.","Quarterly long-term net inflows of $55 billion were positive in both index and active strategies including approximately $1 billion of active equity net inflows during the quarter. We achieved 5% or greater long-term organic base fee growth for the fifth consecutive quarter despite the challenging market environment. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $35 billion driven by strong flows into core ETFs. During recent periods of elevated market volatility, iShares ETF once again offered price transparency and secondary market liquidity to investors, demonstrated by the highest weekly exchange volume ever in the U.S., trading approximately $285 billion on exchange during a single week in February. Retail net inflows of $17 billion representing 11% annualized organic growth continued to trend positively and have now increased for five consecutive quarters. Inflows were positive in the U.S. and internationally and were paid by $10 billion of flows into our top performing active fixed income platform or 93% of our U.S. active fixed income mutual fund assets of top quartile performance over the trailing 5-year period.","Equity inflows of $4 billion were driven by flows into active Asian and European equities while multi-asset flows were driven by $3 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund. Institutional net inflows of $3 billion resulted from significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients de-risked, rebalanced or saw liquidity in the current environment. Index flows of $10 billion driven by continued demand for LDI solutions more than offset active net outflows of $7 billion, which were impacted by a single multi-asset redemption related to client M&A activity and fixed income outflows linked to profit taking and cash repatriation planning. Despite overall flat organic asset growth, institutional clients drove 5% annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter driven in part by momentum in higher fee alternative products. Core alternatives, net inflows of nearly $2 billion reflected inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Illiquid alternative fundraising momentum continued into 2018 with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the first quarter.","Finally, despite typical seasonal outflows in the cash industry during the first quarter, the strength of BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform drove $3 billion of net inflows as we continue to invest in our cash business and leverage scale for clients. Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits and the investments we have made to build a differentiated global business model, which can perform in various market environments. Our goal remains to exceed clients\u2019 needs by optimizing investments in talent and technology and delivering consistent and differentiated organic growth over time.","With that, I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call. Driven by a strong January, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter representing a 4% annualized organic growth rate and a 5% annualized organic base fee growth in a volatile market environment. These results reflect our ability to deepen partnerships and manage holistic relationships with a more diverse and global set of clients than at any time in our history. Meeting with clients recently in Europe, in Asia and here in the United States, I believe we are positioned with clients has never been stronger. The quality of our discussions our people are having is more robust than ever. BlackRock\u2019s technology and risk analytics and the diversity of our investment platform positions us to have a broader a deeper more robust conversations with our clients about their long-term needs.","Following a period of historically low volatility in 2017, the record high equity markets in the first month of 2018, investors experienced the spike in equity market volatility in February and March rising concerns over a trade war and headlines in the technology sector have tempered investment sentiment causing many clients to pause or pullback as it become more uncertain about the future. In addition, the yield curve has hit its flattest level since October 2007 as it spread between 10 and 2-year treasuries has shrunk to just 50 basis points.","While the prospects of rising rate tends to push investors away from long-dated fixed income, the flat curve is creating strong relative risk return opportunities in short duration funds and cash management strategies, which we saw clients take advantage of in the first quarter. While global economic growth prospects and expectations for corporate earnings remains strong in the quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform and increased M&A activity influenced client behaviors and we saw a number of large inflows and a large amount of outflows as clients rebalanced and saw its liquidity to either fund future capital allocation or be more aggressive in share repurchases. Even with these various cross-currents retail and institutional clients turn to BlackRock over the quarter for both active and index strategies. Clients expressed demand across a diverse range of active and index fixed income strategies, including unconstrained short duration total return and emerging market debt funds. We also saw strong utilization of equity ETFs as simple and efficient tools for both taking on and deemphasizing market exposures.","Finally, increasing demand for risk on assets and performance drove flows into active equities and alternative strategies. For long-term strategy at BlackRock has been to create a diverse and integrated global investment in technology platform, one that serves clients in all market environments. We harness this platform to construct and manage risk aware holistic portfolios that help clients to achieve long-term outcomes. We also provide institutions and intermediary partners with risk management and portfolio construction technology to better operate on their own businesses. As I discussed in my letter to shareholders in our annual report, this focus on client needs forms the foundation of our long-term strategy, it will continue to drive future growth at BlackRock for our clients and our shareholders. Our strategy is simple, we will continue investing in our business to establish a clear market leadership in areas of the greatest growth in client demand and we will leverage those full capabilities of our platform to enhance the value for our clients.","In iShares, we have steadily invested over time and are the market leader today. We have generated over $900 billion of net inflows or a 22% annualized organic asset growth since we acquired the business in 2009. And in the first quarter, we once again captured the number one share year-to-date globally in the U.S. and European net inflows as well as a number one share of flows in the equity and smart beta categories. Demand is growing from clients who would utilize ETFs for efficient liquid market exposure through the secondary market. February\u2019s volatile global equity markets drove heightened ETF trading volume and iShares performed as our clients have come to expect. During the week from February 5 through February 9 when the U.S. stock market had suffered its steepest declines in more than 2 years, U.S. listed ETFs traded more than $1 trillion on exchanges. With iShares creating a record $285 billion yet creates and redeem activity of iShares funds over that same period of time was very low at less than $3 billion, demonstrating the benefits of a robust secondary market to create additional liquidity in distressed markets.","Our iShares core products generated $32 billion in net inflows in the quarter as we continued to see increased adoption by ETFs by individuals. They increasingly are using ETFs at the core of their portfolios alongside cost efficient and high performing active. Institutions are engaging with BlackRock to create solutions that use ETFs in innovative ways to drive absolute return and positive outcomes. For example, this quarter we worked with a client seeking in term and liquid exposures to hedge fund beta. While they completed due diligence for their long-term hedge fund allocation, we designed an optimized basket of low cost iShares that closely replicated a hedge funds index, while maximizing liquidity and minimizing tracking year. This is a great example of how we harness our scale, our technology and our portfolio construction expertise to create unique solutions that will meet our client\u2019s needs.","BlackRock\u2019s top performing fixed income platform generated $27 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Capturing client demand in a rising rate environment, inflows were driven by a diverse range of strategies including unconstrained, total return, short duration strategies and our emerging market debt funds. We are also seeing early signs of progress since our active equity platform was revitalized a year ago when we segmented our product offerings across the risk return and value spectrum in the even more effectively harnessing the power of data science and technology to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance. At the end of the quarter, 66% of our fundamental active funds and 84% of both systematic active equity products or above benchmark or peer mediums for the 1-year period. Illiquid alternatives also remained a strategic growth priority for BlackRock as clients search for diverse solutions, diverse sources of return. We raised $2 billion of new commitments in the quarter for a total of $18 billion of dry powder to invest on behalf of our clients as we continue to build out our platform. We currently are managing $49 billion across our illiquid alternative platform and including our illiquid strategies, our core alternative platform now has $102 billion in assets.","Finally, our cash management platform is strongly positioned for future growth. We have invested organically and inorganically to build scale and enhance our distribution reach of our cash management platform. Today, we managed nearly $460 billion in cash. We generated $3 billion in net inflows in the first quarter despite seasonal outflows for the cash industry and we are very well-positioned for additional organic growth opportunities laid into the prospects of a rising rate environment as corporations are repatriating their cash related to the U.S. tax reform.","Last month, we have crossed 10 years since the start of the financial crisis. Over this time, we have seen many developments in the regulatory environments that have impacted our clients\u2019 operations and increased their need for technology solutions to help manage risk. Since our founding 30 years ago, we have always focused on using technology to better understand risk in client\u2019s portfolios. Aladdin risk analytics capabilities are what enabled us to be a trusted advisor of our clients during the financial crisis. And as we look ahead, we will remain steadfast in maintaining a high standard for risk management and continuing to use technology to enhance our own and our clients business. The movement to our fee-based advice in wealth management globally has continued to be strong even with some greater uncertainty around the fiduciary rule in the U.S.","We continue to view this as an important trend and will require wealth managers to put greater focus on the overall portfolio not just products. We will be more focused on risk management and most importantly there will be more focus on a repeatable scalable investment process. This fee-based trend in recent market volatility has increased demand for our capabilities such as Aladdin Risk for Wealth, our newly launched advisory center in the U.S., FutureAdvisor and iRetire, which helped advisors construct better portfolios and scaling there of their own businesses. Demand remains strong for institutional Aladdin business, especially in Europe where many of these of our clients are upgrading their technology infrastructure to support growth in a changing regulatory environment. We saw 19% year-over-year growth in our technology and risk management revenues in the first quarter and continue to expect double-digit growth going forward. In early 2018, we also established the BlackRock lab for artificial intelligence in Palo Alto. To advance how BlackRock uses artificial intelligence and associated disciplines, machine learning, data science, natural language processing to improve outcomes and to drive progress for our investors, for our clients and for the overall firm.","Another area where technology and analytics are becoming increasingly important is in sustainable investing or ESG related strategies. More and more clients, not only in Europe, but increasingly in the United States are seeking to understand their exposures to various environmental, social and governance related risk in their investments. From BlackRock\u2019s perspective, business relevant sustainable issues can contribute to a company\u2019s long-term financial performance. For this reason, we are increasingly integrating these considerations into our technology and risk platform for our investment research, for portfolio construction and the stewardship process that we do. In addition, BlackRock now manages over $430 billion in sustainable investment strategies and we see demand growing from institutions and retail clients alike in line with our strategic focus on technology and being a market leader in areas of greatest client demand. Last month we appointed three new Directors with combined expertise in technology, financial services and fast growing markets to join our Board of Directors Peggy Johnson, Bill Ford and Mark Wilson will bring a deep institutional industry knowledge with fresh perspectives on key areas of future growth for BlackRock.","The value BlackRock is delivering to clients and the growth we are generating for shareholders is driven by our talented employees living our principles and believing in our purpose every day. It\u2019s our culture anchored in our principles that ensure we never forget who we are, who we serve even as the markets, our industry and even our firm experiences constant and sub times dramatic changes. Rob and I are focused on instilling this culture for a next generation with all of our 14,000 employees around the globe because that is what will position BlackRock to thrive and generate continued growth going forward in our next 30 years. We begin 2018 by maintaining our steadfast focus on the client\u2019s needs. We continue to invest in and execute on our strategy for long-term growth leveraging the benefits of our technology and scale, reinvigorating our focus on institutionalizing our culture for our future.","With that let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence Fink","Hi Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hi , good morning Larry. Gary, thanks for taking my question here. So over the last 2 years equity ETF flows have benefited from the implementation of the DOL [ph] role which is now vacated and also very strong equity market backdrop which triggered re-risking, I am just wondering how do you look for equity ETF flows to trend here, is there some deceleration as we have this evolving backdrop and also what\u2019s the risk now to equity ETF outflows if we have a large pullback in the equity markets just given that the business is now more mature?","Robert Kapito","So we are going to be subject to the same cycles Craig that everyone else\u2019s in our active equity flows. But today, we are in a much better position because we have performance and our products are priced properly should be the best value in their class. So as we see cycles move towards active equities when active equity managers can outperform the benchmark including their fees, you will expect to see some flows out of the index product into the active equity product and we should be the beneficiary of that. With the changes in the DOL rules a lot of the financial advisors have been using index like an ETF products to create model portfolios and build those model portfolios with the least expensive products. But as the cycle started to change they will start to incorporate more active products in that both active fixed income and active equities and we should be the beneficiary of that now more than we have been in the past.","Laurence Fink","Craig I would also add, we have witnessed a big shift from the big financial advisory firms more towards advice. I think that shift is moving more rapidly whether we are guided by a fiduciary rule or not next week, the SEC will be reviewing this. So we will hear from the SEC. But I do believe that changes that we have witnessed by the large platforms has changed how they sell products, I think it\u2019s much more portfolio based. I believe it\u2019s \u2013 we will continue to be more portfolio baseless product base, more solutions based, but I would also say they are in confusion as you suggested in U.S., but in Europe it\u2019s moved. Europe has definitely moved especially with MiFID II much more towards advice and through a portfolio of solution. So I think this trend towards advice is global, it is not slowing down. And I do believe and I will reconfirm it the secular growth in ETFs will continue to be very strong we have said and we have not changed our opinions over the next 3 years to 5 years ETFs will double in size.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Laurence Fink","Hi Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hi. Thanks very much. It can\u2019t help, but try to ask you guys if the move up in LIBOR and LIBOR OIS, curious if you think it\u2019s indicative of any future credit prompts just to move up in rates and rate expectations and some technical issues and then importantly how does that impact your fixed income platform flows activity levels things like that?","Gary Shedlin","So volatility in fixed income market was actually really good for us as you know Glenn. We are one of the largest players in the fixed income space and creating some more interest in higher rates is going to pull a significant amount of money out of the cash into products that have been fairly stable for quite a long period of time. So you know that there is a very big imbalance right now because of volatility where we estimate there is over $50 trillion of cash that\u2019s sitting in bank accounts earning less than 1%, some places negative. So as rates go up especially in the short end that is going to attract a lot of this cash into the fixed income markets of which we can manage that money rather directly into the normal fixed income products or into ETF fixed income products which seem to be getting a lot of the new flows from rises in rates.","Laurence Fink","I am going to also add Glenn, we did witness outflows in high yield as an industry, as a firm and so your statement related to LIBOR, there I think it\u2019s a reflection on some fears of the credit markets are \u2013 have over I think the credit spreads have tightened way too much and are going to witness some possible widening of yes more of a directional of the equity markets more than anything else. I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a systemic change, but I do believe the rise in LIBOR is an indicator of some poor positioning by some professionals, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything of any significance at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.","Laurence Fink","Hey Bill.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very much. Good morning everyone and thank you for taking the question. Just coming back to expenses, so thank you very much for the added disclosure, that is helpful. As we look at the 383, particularly in the G&A line, $32 million how should we think about that going forward, Gary you mentioned a few things in there that sort of affected the year-to-year change, but I know you are spending a bit, I heard that the income through the commentary as well, is this a good base to run-off of or are there more seasonal pressures here that maybe changed up to basically get to the second half of the year?","Gary Shedlin","Good morning, Bill. Thanks for your questions. I think we tried to answer that question last quarter, we will continue to try and answer it again. I think that we need to continually focus on looking at the entirety of our discretionary expense base. There is definitely an interplay between our G&A line and compensation and as we continue to invest more across the platform some of those items will hit the G&A line like data, like technology, like occupancy, obviously MiFID II costs hit there as well. But we are also as we do that we are able to change the composition of our employee base. So, I think as we said before as we would expect G&A expense to increase in stable markets, we are also looking for compensation as a percent of revenue to decline primarily as a functional historical investment and scale in our business. So, the result when you look at the two of them again assuming that we have got fairly stable markets is continued upward bios in our margin and we intend to continue playing offense in this environment. We went into 2018 planning to basically invest as much in the business as we have in years. And I think for the moment really nothing is changing our view there. That being said, I think we have tried to call out and you will see obviously on some of the disclosures there, I mean, most of that was basically in our cue, we are moving it up a little bit. We have added a few lines. We have been calling out what we have called some more episodic, let\u2019s call it non-core G&A lines that make that line item bump around a lot and we think hopefully with the incremental disclosure you will have better insight as to what the recurring investment through that category is.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about the BlackRock lab for artificial intelligence, just curious how you are thinking about the key objectives for this lab how you are betting it within the overall organization and what sort of metrics you are focused on in measuring the success of this lab and maybe you can share with us any sort of stats on the headcount and how you see that growing over the next couple of years?","Laurence Fink","So, this is really quite important to us and it dovetails with the first area that we have built to assist portfolio managers, which is the BlackRock Investment Institute and this was getting all of our portfolio teams together with some of the best econometrics and people to talk about how we can structure portfolios better. Once we have that together and that\u2019s a pretty significant group of people that meet 4 times a year and produce weekly commentaries and this is really for internal use. With the success of that, we wanted to take this further, because we believe that utilizing artificial intelligence and people, so man and machine is going to create a better result of man or machine. And so what we are doing is we are staffing up and we hired a number of technology-oriented people, we have hired someone from NASA, we have hired someone from the technology area out-west. And what we are doing is we are putting together a group to start to use the technology that we have already built to see how we can find some significance in that forward performance. So, this is the beginning of what everyone has been writing about. It\u2019s more than just fin-tech. This is using data to try to pull it in first which is not easy to do. Yes, there is the technology to pull in the data of which most data has only been around for the last 5 years getting access to the data, pulling it in, analyzing it, seeing if there is any significance to it and then testing that in the portfolios of our performance. So, this is a real important effort that\u2019s going on and we are investing quite a lot into this and it will dovetail into our investment institute, the internal research that we do, the portfolio manager\u2019s capability and eventually all be able to be the throughput through Aladdin and our other technology.","Robert Kapito","Let me add one more thing Michael. As I have said in many quarterly updates and I just discussed that in my Chairman\u2019s letter that is going to be released, I guess, Friday, Monday, I have it already. Technology continues to be one of our most important focuses as a firm. And this is a focus not just for the investment areas of focus across the entire firm. Clearly, using technology to give us better insights for investment performance is key, but we have historically have used technology to improve our operational scale, I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have improved over the last 5 years. We are using technology to enhance our connectivity with our clients in creating better distribution technology. And obviously we have historically viewed technology to enhance our risk analytics. So our scale and our global reach is allowing us to continue to invest and invest significantly for the future on behalf of our shareholders and our client. But there is I think our labs is just another step in this investment. The key for us to continue to drive our scale, our connectivity to our clients and better investment performance is pretty better operational efficiencies. So if you find this question about how many people we are going to be hiring and overall that\u2019s significant whether the number is as we \u2013 that is our expectation that these investments as they have in the past is going to create more operational efficiencies over the longer. And I believe that\u2019s how we continue to drive our business, are driving by creating better operating efficiencies, by creating more scale, especially as we expand globally and the needs for better risk analytics as we are investing more and more globally worldwide. So this is just a component, it\u2019s pretty special as Rob suggested. And we believe we are going to get better, deeper insight on AI specifically with this one investment, but it is part of the whole strategy of investing related to technology.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Laurence Fink","Hi Brian.","Brian Bedell","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to shift back to the financial advisor sales effort that you guys have been obviously really printing up to the last few years and especially with Aladdin for Wealth, could you just mention the potential for a renewed sort of advisors revisiting active strategies, maybe if you can talk about that a little bit more and how you are positioning your ETF franchise versus your active franchise with advisors. And also on smart beta, obviously we have been more in a beta rally with the ETF flows over the last year or so, do you see a greater demand for smart beta products versus the beta with the certain new volatility regime in the markets?","Laurence Fink","So working backwards, we are seeing a huge demand for our smart beta product. And you know that in 2017 we saw about 15% organic growth in smart beta and we are really differentiating ourselves in that particular area. At the end of the first quarter, we managed about $190 billion in factor based products including 108 of smart beta ETFs which were the number one player. iShares now has a global lineup of 147 smart beta ETFs, so we have created that as we are seeing the demand. We did see factor based inflows of about $3 billion this quarter, representing so far 6% annualized organic growth rates. So we believe the fact that strategies are going to continue to grow and we are investing in people and technology in the states. We have a pretty good set of unique advantages in factors, a rich history of innovation and thought leadership. As we created the first smart beta equity yield fund in 1979, we have the full spectrum of strategies from smart beta whether it be multifactor, single factor min valve to enhance to long only factors which enable us to actually create solutions. The construction capabilities I believe that we have help our clients to construct what we call a factor aware model, that technology and analytics that we have powered by Aladdin really help our team isolate and monitor factors in our investment process and to perform the necessary risk and analysis for clients and lastly, our people which we have included Andrew Ang, who heads our factor-based strategies group and they bring significant portfolio construction experience and model-based investment skills for the clients. Now, when it comes to ETFs and financial advisors, financial advisors are being asked to do more, it\u2019s not a stock picking or bond picking environment. What they need to do is they need to have the tools to be able to understand the risk behind the individual portfolios that they have, they need help in modeling portfolios. And a lot of this is going to be coming through technology. So, we have spent many, many years now building technology for large institutional clients and have had most recently the ability to use that technology to bring it to the financial advisor, where they could look at individual portfolios and understand the risk that they have in the returns and match it to the liabilities or the outcome that a client needs and not only individual, but they could do it in aggregate for all of the portfolios that they are overseeing. That gives them not only the ability to have better information, but it also gives them the ability to be much more efficient and they can handle many, many more clients.","So, by working to understand what they need for their clients, they need to grow their business. We are seeing a huge demand for that capability. And of course when you are modeling and the changes in compensation have taken place for financial advisors, they need to create portfolios based upon the lowest priced products that they could have, and that describes some of the movement between the alpha seeking strategies and the passive and ETF business. And part of the ETF business is driven by this need to have products to express precision ways to get returns in a portfolio that they have. So, it all dovetails in if you have now the analytics, the technology, the modeling capability, the portfolio construction experience and then the products to put in. And if you think about what Larry described in his opening session, it was developing these tools specifically for that and that\u2019s been our mission and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s driving more financial advisors who want to work with BlackRock, because we can provide the full service that they need for their business going forward and achieve the desired result for their client.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Hi, Larry. Thanks a lot. So just a question on the institutional channel and just two parts you mentioned lot of the inflows and outflows kind of the lumpy things in the quarter, has that mostly died down or do you expect more and the more important question is you highlighted the alternative platform. And specifically on the illiquids, I think you guys are around $50 billion, it\u2019s definitely scale relative to some of the players in the industry, but some are at 150, 200 plus have relationships with most of the LPs out there. So, if you all fund-raising backdrops create, just wanted to get an update on your guys\u2019 strategy, maybe ambitions for the illiquid alts and where you think that can be over the next couple of years?","Laurence Fink","I think you are correct in saying we had a good quarter. We expect illiquid alts could be one of the more significant delta or net drivers for us in the next few years. We have spent since 2012 a long foundation in building our infrastructure business is up to $18 billion now we are out fund-raising now for another global alternative energy fund. We are in the process of raising long-term private capital fund. And so I think we are going to have a lot to talk about over the next few quarters related to the opportunities and the position that BlackRock has across our illiquid platform. I would also though suggest I think we are in very good position in our illiquid alts area too. So, we look at this as a important growth area for the firm. We believe this will be a continuing waiver in our net organic base fee column. And we purposely have been investing in these areas now for the last 5 years and I do believe we are just beginning to see the net positive flows into these strategies.","Gary Shedlin","Michael, I would just remind people that a couple of things on the illiquid alts business. First of all, when we talk about the so-called committed, but un-invested capital that there is about an $18 billion incremental pipeline for that $50 billion number that you mentioned, which frankly is across the board both in terms of private equity solutions and private credit, which is a big focus for us. Larry mentioned both real estate infrastructure and obviously by virtue of the fact that we are a solutions oriented firm we actually have a fairly significant effort and time together solutions of alternatives, which has got another couple billion of commitments that are outstanding. Secondly and that not creates as you know for us, because we call it committed capital and not net new business, it\u2019s because we don\u2019t earn fees on the committed capital, so if that committed capital basically gets put into the ground that becomes a future bank of net new business for us going forward. And then secondarily just because the performance fee line gets a lot of attention now and then remember, we also don\u2019t account for our performance fees in illiquids the same way as some of those pure-plays do. We are basically waiting until the end of the cycle of those funds once the capital is returned and no longer subject to claw-back and we are not marking to market that across the board. We do try to provide some incremental disclosure for you in some of our annual filings on that, so you have an idea of what the built-in bank there is. But I think as we think about it, we are very bullish on the future growth prospects of that sector.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Thanks. Hey, guys. Wondering if you can give us an update on the actives business outside the U.S. really just helping you guys could maybe give us a little bit incremental color on where you see the biggest opportunities and what you are most optimistic about outside the U.S.?","Laurence Fink","So, the area that we are seeing the most interest right now is in Asian equity franchise. A lot of people are looking for exposure there and lucky for us we have some very large products that have excellent performance. Those where we saw some of the inflows this quarter and expect that to continue as we are hearing more and more people are trying to figure out how to get exposure into those areas. The second area is the European equity and European equity hedge fund that we have, both have significant demand primarily because of their long-term track record and performance and you find the cycle here of what we are saying. When you have good products at the right price with good performance, people find out and want to invest but the two I think growth areas for us outside of the U.S. have been European equities, primarily in the large cap side and Asian equities really across the stack.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Pat.","Patrick Davitt","Hey, good morning. So, we are starting to see UK pension mandate consolidation enough if you press or accelerate and we would expect the upcoming consult and anti-competition review to push that along. As one of the largest pension managers there, I imagine you could be a consolidator through this theme. So, could you speak to how that\u2019s playing out from a flow and fee perspective and how you see BlackRock positioned as a net winner or a loser as it plays out?","Laurence Fink","Well, right now, I would say considering the things that we are working on we will be a beneficiary of money that\u2019s going to be in motion, because of the changes in regulation and the movement of money out of some of the pension plans. So that\u2019s on the good side. On the negative side of that, there is nobody that wants to pay increased fees, I can assure you that. So this is where the scale and size and efficiency that a manager have is going to put them added advantage. And that\u2019s really what the key advantage is for us to be able to go in and take a large size at fee levels that are within the context of what they are willing to pay. So I think we will be a beneficiary, but it\u2019s going to be a lot of work and the revenue opportunities are not going to be as large as one might think.","Laurence Fink","I will just add one more point to that before going to my closing remarks. The consultant community because you suggested has been a heavy winner in some of the OCIO businesses. I think that\u2019s where the opportunities will be for us and as Rob suggested those are the lower fee businesses. But I do believe there we can be a consolidator and we don\u2019t have any apparent conflicts that are being investigated in the UK pension community.","With that, let me just thank you all for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment platform, investments we made, our risk management capabilities, our technology what we provide to our clients as they are trying to invest to achieve their long-term goals. We have continuously evolved our platform to deliver the outcomes for our clients through a changing market backdrop and today we are better positioned. We are having deeper dialogues. We are having more consistent meetings with our clients than ever before. In these higher volatility moments this is when BlackRock over 30 years have differentiated ourselves. The anomaly of low volatility in 2017 is now over, we are back to more volatile world, different inputs, different issues and this is where BlackRock is \u2013 has historically done quite well and I believe we are well-positioned for that. We are focused on delivering growth and scale advantages to both our clients and our shareholders in 2018. And I think the first quarter was a good start to that and I expect a continuation of that throughout 2018. So have a good quarter. And we will talk to everybody sometimes in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3455":["BlackRock, Inc.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher J. Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, let's begin.","Gary S. Shedlin","Good morning. Thanks, Chris. Happy New Year to everybody. Its my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we generated industry leading organic growth, maintain stable operating margins, while continuing to invest in our business and return to approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 77%.","The differentiation and strength of BlackRock\u2019s diverse global investment platform, once again enabled us to generate consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty.","We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders.","In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full-year operating income of $4.7 billion, increased 3% versus a year-ago and earnings per share of $19.60, were up 1% which included the impact of a higher tax rate in 2015.","Non-operating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30% compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year-ago that reflected $39 million of non-recurring discrete tax benefits.","We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, though the actual effect of tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year.","BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest low quarter in BlackRock\u2019s history and reflects resilience of our differentiated business model.","For the full-year of 2016, BlackRock generated long-term net new business of $152 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee retail and iShares businesses contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Long-term net inflows were diversified by asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full-year.","BlackRock continue to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market. As fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion and full-year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year-ago. Organic growth and improved investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached record levels in 2015.","Fourth quarter and full-year base fee each grows 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth, despite over a $150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM over the last 12 months.","FX was a significant drag in 2015 and we estimate that full-year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant currency basis. Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat, despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent data on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once again underperform developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies.","Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year-ago, driven by our broad suite of active offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge fund that delivered exceptional full-year performance and locked in the third quarter. Full-year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our diverse investment platform.","Fourth quarter of BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Full-year 2015 Aladdin revenue were $528 million, which represented 82% of BRS revenue, grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business momentum in Aladdin, driven by trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi asset risk solutions.","Our financial markets advisory business ended 2015 with a $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment.","Total expense for the fourth quarter rose $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation, and G&A expense. For the full-year of 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher headcount associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation partly offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant, because we determine compensation on a full-year basis.","Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of deal related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter.","Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $91 million primarily reflected a planned uptick in year-end marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense, and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal related expense. Full-year G&A expense of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment, not withstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter.","If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level -- higher annual level of G&A spend during 2016. Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year-ago compared to a similar increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full-year, flat to our 2014 level.","We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business, and have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis point since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we stated in the past, we also do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through a market cycle to grow share.","We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.","At times, our strategic investments will also begin organic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform, I Cuadrada, a Latin American infrastructure investor and Future Advisor, a digital wealth manager.","In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM, currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016.","During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend on a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%.","We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015, and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price.","Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full-year net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion respectively were positive in both our active and index franchises and benefited from significant flows into iShares.","Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion for the year; representing full-year organic growth of 13%. iShares captured the number one share of global, U.S., and European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full-year.","Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S equities, and a broad array of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core, high yield and investment grade corporate bond funds.","BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw a fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital gains distributions. Full-year of 2015 net flows of $38 billion representing 7% organic asset growth were driven by diversified flows across our top performing fixed income platform.","International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015, and were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date number one ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows. U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S mutual fund industry.","BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise had long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the year as we continue to see sizeable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of low fee institutional index products.","However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher fee active offerings as clients recognize the value added alpha generating platform we\u2019ve built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive fee impact of this mixed shift is in line with our growth strategy and enabled BlackRock\u2019s institutional business to deliver organic based fee growth of 4% in 2015.","We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad based across a diverse alternatives platform including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds, and alternative solutions offerings.","We ended 2015 with another strong fund raising quarter for liquid alternatives raising $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last three years we\u2019ve raised more than $17 billion in commitments and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translate into flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will be a source of future revenue growth.","In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent data, and significant currency movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing for future growth. We remain confident that BlackRock\u2019s differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of our client and shareholders in the years to come.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full-year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock\u2019s diverse business model can consistently generate strong results.","Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly with the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more than a decade. Growth in China remains sluggish, so will emerging markets including Brazil, face significant political and economic challenges, and divergence of developed market monetary policies driving heightened volatility and rates, currency, and equity markets.","The Federal Reserve\u2019s action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked a end of a historical period of monetary policy, a combination in the U.S and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All of these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016, while higher levels of volatility ahead, as already witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients need change as well.","The differentiation of BlackRock\u2019s core business model drives consistency and resilience in our results. This positions BlackRock to invest in a platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and volatile times and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change, so that we\u2019re positioned to provide our clients with investment solutions to meet their evolving needs.","In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continual low rate, modest beta driven returns, investors will search for income, they will search for capital appreciation, through a combination of both active and alternative investments, factors, smart beta strategies, and hybrid solutions.","No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform, supported by superior risk management, technology, and investment performance. And this is what\u2019s driving a deeper connectivity with our clients than ever before and once again drove BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter and our full-year results.","BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and a $152 billion for the year, representing annualized organic growth of 5% and 4% respectively. Flows were driven by client demand for both active and index solutions across asset categories, asset classes across regions.","We saw $61 billion in growth in a year when most people talked about there is not demand for active strategies, we saw $61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows.","We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi asset, and $5 billion in alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms, and in our institutional platform we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low fee institutional index of flows.","What I\u2019m particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is and its evident in 2015 there were 13 countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different retail and iShares products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows.","The industry leading organic growth story at BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is in addition that we raised a 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product. Alpha driven performance fees and expense awareness translated into positive results in both the top and bottom line, even in the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX.","BlackRock is committed in having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide, completely positions BlackRock to understand our clients needs and a specific investment requirements to better help them navigate these markets. And we\u2019re in a better position I believe than any other firm in the world to do that.","The BlackRock investment institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles for our investors to exchange the knowledge they built in local market, debate investment topics, share expertise with the goal of generating better alpha and managing risk for our clients.","This connectivity, this worldwide connectivity also has enabled us to have a deeper dialogue and level of trust with clients around the world. This year the BlackRock investment institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in person meetings, hosted conference calls and critical market events, and in in-depth publications. This knowledge and the connected tissue combined with the talent of our investment teams has contributed to a strong performance across our active platform.","As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets are above benchmarks or peer medium for the last three years. Throughout 2015, we continue to make progress on the revigorization and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong result for our clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer medium for the one-year period highlighted by the strong turnaround we seen in the performance in our flagship equity dividend fund.","The strength of our active performance has translated into flows, as I said early in -- we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015 in our active strategies, despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry.","We continue to diversify our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution based strategies to solve our clients most complex investment needs. Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi asset solutions as institution look to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges.","On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015. And BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed income products, our high yield products, and our Multi Asset income products. in the United States, the breadth of BlackRock\u2019s product suite across active index and iShares resonated with our retail clients.","We remain focused on growing global iShare market share and driving market -- global market expansion, which translated into strong flows in 2015.","The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn the BlackRock iShares franchise which generated $60 billion in net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the number one share of flows in the U.S., Europe globally with 37% global market share for the full-year.","2015 iShares flows was a $130 billion, primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income. The global core series saw flows of $46 billion representing a 23% organic growth and record fixed income flows of $50 billion was concentrated in our high yield products, including investment grade, corporate bonds, and our high yield funds.","Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares which led the industry and fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015.","Fixed income market volatility rose in December and during this time the market stressed BlackRock\u2019s flagship high yield ETF, HYG, enabled clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute pricing with ample liquidity.","More than $20 billion of HYG traded in the two weeks ending December 18 were less than $1 billion of net redemptions providing our markets and our clients\u2019 substantial liquidity with limited impact on the underlying markets.","As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETF and specifically iShares are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost effective investment solutions. We continue to find opportunity to learn from market events to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of our clients and iShares and across BlackRock\u2019s platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a fiduciary to our clients. ","Throughout the year BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a combination of investment for organic growth, for acquisitions, and the evolution of our talent.","Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We are investing in big data and tax analysis to make better portfolio management decision across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment style.","Factor based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements to our smart beta and factor based investing platform, including the hiring of Andrew Young and BlackRock generated nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015, driven by iShares minimum vol funds.","We are investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partner for a high quality technological enabled advice capabilities to improve our clients\u2019 investment experiences. We close on the acquisition of Future Advisor in the fourth quarter and we recently signed our first two clients, representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S digital wealth management space.","We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional strategies to investments and real estate infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform.","Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past five years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM and we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top performing internal talent to develop products organically as well as bringing in new managers.","We remain focused on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we\u2019ve grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion. This includes the industry leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability, and meaningful investments in Latin America, like our acquisition and our partnership with PEMEX.","These activities offer long-term benefits to both investors and the economies, where they contribute to economic growth, contributes to the country\u2019s job creation and most importantly it contributes to a positive environmental impact.","In 2015, we continue to invest in the BlackRock impact platform which manages now more than $200 billion to provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact society.","At BlackRock embracing change has always been a core part of who we\u2019re. Nearly every year we take a fresh look at the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolve the organization in anticipation of changes of our clients needs in anticipation of the global markets.","Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders in roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits.","This week again we announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our people and evolving our organizations to meet these challenging needs.","Looking at the quality of the leaders, taking on new or expanded roles, I\u2019m incredibly proud of the depth of the talent that we\u2019ve and I believe today we have the strongest leadership team we\u2019ve ever had in the history of BlackRock. And it is the quality and talent of this team that allows BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015, despite the vol of the markets and positions us very well for 2016. It is this team; they\u2019re the reason that we\u2019ve forged such a trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest financial challenges.","As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We will continue to develop our talent and seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate, and to deliver the returns for our shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning, Larry. So first question on active bond flows. I\u2019m just wondering, given the improvement in yields over the last six months what are you seeing across your institutional client base and how is this compared to retail where there has been a historic reaction already to high yield bond prices, bank loan prices and global bond prices where there has been a decline?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, the widening in spreads is a blessing for our insurance clients. That\u2019s first and foremost. Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I\u2019ve commented in the past, the whole insurance industry or a good part of it is short-term liability duration and are hoping for higher rates. We haven\u2019t seen higher rates; obviously, we are sitting here with a very low 10-year Treasury rate, but we most certainly have seen a widening in credit spreads. And I think as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand. And so, as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally. And as you suggested, some of the widening of spreads are the fears if higher rates are going to produce some selling possibly from retail, but we haven\u2019t seen anything dramatic yet. We haven\u2019t seen really any dramatic outflows on iShares yet. So, I don\u2019t think there is any real massive change yet. And I think one thing you should be aware Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institution sitting down on their net, this year\u2019s asset allocation. You\u2019re going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start doing their reallocations maybe. And so most recently one would think, in some cases some pension funds because of the decline in equities they\u2019ll rebalance out of fixed income back in the equities as they, if they want to have consistent asset allocations. But our performance in fixed income, I think you know we had 91% of our products above peer medium over the last three years and so -- and that\u2019s across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low duration products, mortgage products, high yield. And so, we\u2019re in a pretty good position to have broad based conversations with our clients.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Larry. Just as my follow-up, I had an expense question here for Gary. Gary, G&A expenses have trended down two years in a row now. I heard your color that, I think they\u2019re likely going to be up in \u201916. But can you help us in terms of magnitude, and also given the revenue headwinds in the first quarter just from beta. Do you have any wiggle room that if things get worse you can actually maybe cut a little bit into G&A too?","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Craig. So I think -- yes, I think first of all we wanted to make sure that people understand kind of some of what went on in the fourth quarter. And as you recall, during the year we told you we\u2019ve been under spending versus our original expectation going into the -- into 2015. And I would say that was a function initially of timing. And as the markets became more volatile during the year frankly overall expense awareness. The fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher, and in fact we booked roughly a third of our annual M&P spend in the quarter alone. And as you saw we incurred about $23 million of onetime deal expenses. Given that elevated level of G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year. Not withstanding that -- not withstanding as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year and I think that reflects our ability to manage the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment. And we continue to remain conscious of the tradeoff between growth and margin especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our spending in the current markets. That being said, I think that if markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the year, but there is obviously some discretion tied to that and we\u2019ll be watching it very carefully.","Laurence D. Fink","And Craig, every year during the financial crisis and after, we do pay attention to our margins, and we navigate our expenses accordingly. And I would say that would be consistent going into 2016.","Craig Siegenthaler","Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Hi. How are you doing? Maybe just a question on, it seems like there was some more regulatory items on the agenda with the most recent one, maybe the SEC liquidity proposal. And I know you guys just submitted a comment letter. I just wanted to get your sense on for the industry particularly given like the market dynamics, like maybe what are the pros, what are the cons? You guys mentioned the nuances between EPS and funds. And I guess, the hard part like, I think for a lot of you who are in the industry is how to calculate some of these things based on different environments. So just given your guidance positioning, I wanted to get your thoughts on how you think this plays out, and what are some of the challenges for it?","Laurence D. Fink","This is a real difficult issue that I don\u2019t -- I think the SEC is going to have, be broad in how they think about this issue. I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify the risk associated to liquidity of every product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that it\u2019s consistent. And there should be probably different variants by product as how you think about liquidity. And I think it\u2019s important for our investors worldwide to have some form of measurement tool so they could access the liquidity risk associated with any one product. And then you could see if there is a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we learned that with the Third Avenue episode earlier, this late last year with their divergence and related to liquidity and their product. So to me that is a great example where you can -- if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in products like that or funds like that could have accessed, is it, am I getting the returns necessary to offset the illiquidity that is a component of that investment strategy. So we\u2019re pretty sympathetic to all these things. And the dilemma really arises for the SEC because, if there is some assessment of some sort of a large liquidity for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the markets. It\u2019s going to put -- it will degrade returns for retail investors. The last thing you would want is, having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to be assessing some type of liquidity threshold. And then all the institutional managers will go to a separate account that may have only a 30 day redemption features. So, the last thing I want to do is hurt retail. So, I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct, beyond some type of a measurement tool of having some type of cash holding, I am kind of -- I don\u2019t have a hard fast opinion on that, but I do believe it represents some risk. And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of an open end fund. I think our application that is asked that they access and look at the characteristics differences between ETF and open end mutual funds. And we\u2019ve recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing those different investment product types and their associated risks. So, this is going to be addressed probably sometime in 2016. I think there\u2019s going to be quite a bit of time for a common period into discussion and we\u2019ll see where this goes. But I think this is -- we are in favor of this. I mean, the one thing is important especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant like what we\u2019re experiencing now. One of the big issues is, whatever America is doing now with their big energy savings, are they investing for retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we could have more and more investors feel comfortable that they could invest safely and soundly and they have a better understanding of the risk and characteristics of investing and understanding the liquidity of all the products. If that can then translate into more clients feeling good about investing for the outcome of the retirement, this is all good. So this is why we\u2019re in favor of this type of narrative and dialogue. Obviously we\u2019ll have opinions on how that will play out.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Gary, just a quick follow-up on the expenses. The transaction cost, I know you said $23 million that\u2019s very clear. Just in terms of the normal seasonality, in terms of what you see in fourth quarter versus the first -- fourth versus the first; what's that normal like maybe drop off unlike the marketing spend just so we, you kind of understand and you guys do that every year meaning from the first to the fourth, but I just want to make sure we get that. And then, if the markets do remain volatile and pretty challenging, is there any way of guiding in terms of the expense base whether it\u2019s G&A or overall, what's more variable meaning you have more discretion there?","Gary S. Shedlin","Yes, I mean, I wish I could give you a better answer than you\u2019re probably looking for here, Michael. But I think we obviously are, from an M&P standpoint we plan a spend level during the year. But frankly we react during the year and maintain appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our dollar, and make sure that we\u2019re not simply spending money in a time period where we don\u2019t think people are going to be receptive to a lot of the messages. I think Larry, has talked about in volatility, a lot of investors basically may sit on the sidelines almost nothing you\u2019re going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So there is an element of kind of managing it real time, and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there. But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends. I know you\u2019re tired of hearing me say this, but we really aren\u2019t managing the business to a margin target either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We are absolutely committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we\u2019ve shown you that we\u2019ve done that, right? I\u2019ll go back; I\u2019ve said this in my opening remarks. But we\u2019ve expanded the margin by 450 plus basis points since BGI. We\u2019ve reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we\u2019re going to continue to commit to striking the right balance between strategic investments and managing our spent. It\u2019s a lot easier for everyone sitting around this table candidly to cut cost than it is to invest for growth, that\u2019s the hard part. And I think that the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a market cycle when may others are maybe forced to pull back. But we\u2019re not going to be blind to that. I think the key is obviously kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it really becomes more of a near-term item and more of a mid to long-term, and then obviously we\u2019ll react appropriately.","Laurence D. Fink","But let me add one more thing. Our success in 2015 was directly related to the investments we made in the last few years. I think our differentiated business model has much to do with these investments, and we\u2019re going to -- I\u2019m not suggesting we have five or six investments in mind for 2016 or \u201917 or \u201918. But I do believe we have to have the mindset of growing revenues through investments. And however as we -- as you witnessed when shareholders in 2008 and \u201909 we managed expenses quite extraordinarily at times when you had to do that. So it\u2019s going to be a mix. But we do have a mindset of growing the business and that\u2019s the differentiating factor. As Gary said, it\u2019s a lot easier to just in cutting expenses or cutting headcount, it\u2019s a lot more bold to make the investments at the time when everybody is running away from investments and we\u2019ll continue to look at both.","Michael Carrier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein Research.","Luke Montgomery","Good morning.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Luke.","Gary S. Shedlin","Good morning.","Luke Montgomery","Thanks. So, organic base fee growth has been tracking steadily, and I think quite robustly at 6%. One of the key dynamics though is the fairly rapid growth of your core ETF theories and you\u2019ve been reducing fees there. I know you\u2019re targeting a different kind of investor with those products, but wondered whether you expect those products to eventually get enough liquidity that maybe they\u2019ll attract more institutional interest and whether you see that as a longer term challenge to maintaining the current level of organic base fee growth?","Laurence D. Fink","Rob?","Robert S. Kapito","So, we\u2019re going to respond to what we think investors\u2019 needs are and certainly for the retail or buy and hold customer. They\u2019re looking for the core series to get more specific allocations to the generic product, and we\u2019re going to respond and we\u2019ll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives the client much better access to that precision instrument that they\u2019re looking for. Institutions on the other hand, I think we\u2019ll see. We\u2019re seeing they\u2019re expressing first in the high yield, because they\u2019re yield hogs and they\u2019re looking for yield. But as we expand out the product set, I think they will be looking to invest in a core series as well. But I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s going to put pressure on our fees quite frankly because the institutional set looks differently at the ETF market than the buy and hold set. They\u2019re looking for liquidity. So it\u2019s important that we grow these particular products so they have the liquidity and they\u2019re willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those sectors. So it started out the global core series, which has been very successful for us this year, and we\u2019ve raised a significant amount of assets about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally. And we\u2019re going to also buffer that with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment.","Laurence D. Fink","And Luke, I might just add, just to put into perspective not withstanding the growth in core. Today iShares is a trillion one franchise and the aggregate of the core on a global basis is just -- is a little over $200 billion. So today it represents probably a little less than 20% of the overall business. And keep in mind that the average fee rate for our overall iShares business today is still in the low 30s with that 20% obviously reflecting in much lower fee rate. So it just gives you a sense of the fee rate is still in the overall book of business.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, just touching on the leadership changes you made recently, I was hoping perhaps you could expand on the decision to combine leadership for active equity and scientific active equity, and if you anticipate whether that could have a meaningful effect on how you\u2019re seeking to managing active equity products?","Laurence D. Fink","Yes, so there is less distinction between the active equity business than we were getting credit for. And the scientific active equity business, it\u2019s a business that we use signals, data and lot of quantitative screens for. And in the fundamental business we relied more upon our long-term views of the market, management, the product et cetera. And we find that, there is a tremendous amount of crossover between the two and overlap. And so rather than let, our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap to add additional alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these two teams really merged together you\u2019ll see better results and better alpha from the active equity business. And it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in. How we are driving alpha, and I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio. And my goal is to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities. So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the fundamental offerings. So yes, I\u2019m very excited about it, and I think having this group work together has already shown us some very good results, and this year our equity performance is better than it\u2019s ever been. So we\u2019re going to continue working on coming up with new ways in the market to hit alpha. So very, very positive on this change that we made.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. Thanks a lot for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, Alex.","Alexander Blostein","Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with a question around capital management. It looks the dividend increase this quarter was maybe a little bit lower than what we\u2019ve seen in prior several years. Is that a reflection of just the markets being a little bit choppier? Is it the way you guys are kind of looking to cash flow stream over the next 12 months or just alternative uses of capital? And I guess within the same question, Gary your comments on a kind of flattish buyback but relative to value issuance of stock, I wonder if you could flush it out for us a little bit more.","Gary S. Shedlin","Sure, Alex. So, on the dividend as you know our stated policies to target a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio. That has migrated somewhere between 40% back in 2013 and about 44% last year. And based on what we know today, we think a 5% increase in the dividend is prudent and aligned with that philosophy. As it relates to the buyback, I think in the current market as I mentioned we continue to repurchase -- we are going to continue repurchasing stock in an amount no less than last year. However there\u2019s been a lot of market dislocation and we\u2019re certainly not trying to target or signal any type of beta call on this. But we will be watching the relative valuation of our stock to see if it\u2019s prudent for our shareholders to potential increase as markets evolve over the coming months.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. And then, Larry \u2026","Laurence D. Fink","Alex, let me just add one more thing related to our dividend. I think in the volatile years especially if you look at some of the high paying dividend stocks today, I think you\u2019re going to see quite a few companies are going to have to lower their dividends. One of the histories of our platform, we never lowered our dividends ever even in the financial crisis. And so, to me it\u2019s about a discipline, it\u2019s a commitment. As Gary said, we are always committed of having a proposed dividend rate of somewhere between the 40% and 50% level. And we\u2019ve stuck to that level and we never had -- at some years we had it a little more elevated when we especially after the \u201908 crisis above that range. But we know obviously with the market turnaround and our business growth it became more normalized again. But importantly when we look at capital management, as Gary said, we do look at the combination of dividend and stock repurchases and I think we have quite a bit of flexibility in 2016.","Alexander Blostein","Right. Understood. And then Larry, just a question for you on the Future\u2019s Advisor platform, and the two relationships that you managed, if you guys were able to lock in? Can you spend a minute I guess; on the type of services you\u2019ll be providing the economics of that business to BlackRock as a whole? And then, I guess, just more importantly the opportunity that you see for yourself in that market place?","Laurence D. Fink","We\u2019re very pleasant, at least surprised how well our, the reception from our distribution partners were leaded to the desire of using Future Advisor. The business proposition is, the user technology, it is their name on the platform powered by BlackRock Solutions Future Advisor, not unlike how we use Aladdin. The business proposition is that uses technology on behalf -- to empower their advisors, ultimately to empower their clients with better digital information. Many of our products -- all the products are from our iShares platform. And we believe this will enhance our connectivity and the utilization of iShares to many of these platforms and that is the key business proposition. Probably the most encouraging thing I would not be surprised over the next coming months we announced a number of other licensing and an agreement. So it is very clear more than ever before, our distribution partners are in need of digital advice and they\u2019re looking for different ways of connecting with their clients. And we believe the combination of the Aladdin services that we can provide plus the digital advice through Future Advisor. No organization has that combination -- no organization has that combination. So it is actually allowing us to possibly expand our Aladdin business on top of the digital advice. But let me be clear, we are paid through the utilization of our products and possibly the licensing of Aladdin products. So it\u2019s -- but it sets us up to have deeper connectivity with our distribution partners and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.","Alexander Blostein","Yes. That makes sense. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your final question comes from Bill Katz at Citi.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, Bill.","William Katz","Good morning, everyone. Maybe points of clarification, because a lot of my questions are already asked. Just on the relative valuation dynamic Gary, you had mentioned. Is that relative to your historical multiple or relative to the group, relative to the S&P? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense or sensitivity about what we should be watching for there?","Gary S. Shedlin","Yes, yes and yes.","William Katz","All right.","Laurence D. Fink","That was a good question, Bill.","Gary S. Shedlin","Yes, I mean we\u2019re -- again, as I said we\u2019re not trying to make -- it's not to me a call on whether beta is going to go up or down. It\u2019s a call as to whether or not we think the market is valuing our stock consistent with our growth. And I think that\u2019s -- I think consistency is incredibly important. We\u2019ve been buying the stock all the way up from the low 200s to where we are and we haven\u2019t been looking for moments of beta weakness and we\u2019re going to basically continue with that along and just, and be mindful if we see there is a disconnect.","Laurence D. Fink","We have a lot of flexibility, Bill.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence D. Fink","First of all I want to thank everybody. I felt the questions were quite good this morning and sorry that we didn\u2019t have time to reach everybody. But I\u2019m sure Gary and Tom will spend the time with all of you related to further questions. Our fourth quarter 2015 results reflect the strength in a differentiated business model. And I think hopefully this is what resonates with all of you. It is those investments we made. It is our ability to execute and manage expenses accordingly, grow accordingly, especially in these challenging business environments. We\u2019re going to continue to invest to meet the demands of our clients, to meet the demands of society and hopefully to deliver the long-term returns to our clients so they have a better future also. It is incredibly important in these vulnerable times that everybody, all of us focus on the long-term needs of our clients, not to short-term noise that we\u2019re experiencing everyday but focusing on outcomes for our investors. I do believe BlackRock is the firm that clients are looking for that outcome conversation. And I do believe we will have later dialogue with our clients in 2016 than we did in 2015. With that everyone, hopefully lets enjoy 2016 a little more, and lets hopefully we have -- we can enjoy our day to day job in a better environment. Have a good quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3569":["BlackRock, Inc.

BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results.","While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.","Global trade tensions once again escalated in the second quarter and market volatility followed. US equities climbed to record highs, though domestic equity markets moved down 7% in May only to increase 7% in June, emerging markets remain challenged and the 10-year treasury bond traded below 2%.","Clients accelerated rebalancing and derisking activity, shifting out of equities and into fixed income and cash. BlackRock's globally diverse investment platform, combined with industry-leading risk management and portfolio construction technology, was purposely designed to not only withstand today's market volatility, but thrive in it. Our strategic positioning fosters deeper partnerships with clients, enables us to meet their goals in a variety of market environments, and drives more consistent and differentiated organic growth.","BlackRock generated a record $151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter or 9% annualized organic asset growth as clients once again turned to BlackRock for solutions-oriented advice to meet their long-term investment needs.","Lower total organic base fee growth of 3% reflected mix change favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets and the impact of volatility-driven outflows from higher-fee iShares financial instruments and precision exposures during the month of May.","Second quarter revenue of $3.5 billion was 2% lower than a year ago, driven in part by lower securities lending revenue and lower performance fees in the current quarter. ","Including $61 million of costs associated with the successful launch of a closed-end fund, operating income of $1.3 billion was down 11% compared to a year ago. Earnings per share of $6.41 was down 4% as lower operating income and higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non-operating income and a lower diluted share count in the current quarter.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $79 million of net investment income, primarily driven by the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments and higher marks on unhedged fixed income seed capital investments, but also reflected additional interest expense associated with the mid-April issuance of debt to partially finance the acquisition of eFront.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation.","Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were down 1% year-over-year despite the positive impacts of organic growth and acquisitions, primarily driven by lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of diversion equity beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strategic pricing investments.","Quarterly securities lending revenue declined $33 million or 18% compared to record levels a year ago due to reduced gross exposures partially linked to hedge fund deleveraging in the second half of 2018, lower demand for hard-to-borrow US equities in the softer M&A environment, and lower spreads. In addition, the trend of reduced European seasonal demand continued from previous years.","Diversion equity beta and FX continue to impact year-over-year base fee growth. While the S&P 500 was up 7% on average year-over-year, many markets linked to our higher-fee equity products, including Asia, emerging markets and global natural resources, were down 8% over the same time period, resulting in an overall decline of 2% on our revenue-weighted equity composite index. Dollar appreciation over the last year had a negative 1% impact on our year-over-year base fee growth.","Sequentially, base fees were up 3% as a result of higher average AUM and the effect of one additional day in the quarter. On an equivalent day count basis, our overall fee rate declined 0.4 basis points in the second quarter, reflecting this diversion equity beta and the impact of mix shift towards lower-fee fixed income and cash assets.","Performance fees of $64 million decreased 30% from a year ago, reflecting lower revenue from long-only equity products. However, we have seen improved performance in many of our single strategy hedge funds since year-end, better positioning us to generate performance fees in the second half of the year.","Quarterly technology services revenue increased 20% year-over-year, reflecting continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and the impact of the eFront acquisition which closed in May.","The combination of eFront with Aladdin sets a new standard in investment and risk management technology and reinforces Aladdin's value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world.","As Larry will discuss in more detail, overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and we're already seeing revenue synergies related to the combination of eFront and Aladdin.","Advisory and other revenue at $53 million was down $25 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments.","Total expense was up 4% year-over-year, driven by higher G&A expense which reflected fund launch costs and acquisition-related expense in the current quarter. G&A expense was up $77 million year-over-year and $82 million sequentially, primarily due to $59 million of product launch costs associated with closed-end fund launches during the quarter. We exclude the impact of these product launch costs when reporting our as-adjusted operating margin.","Quarterly G&A expense also included approximately $20 million in professional fees and contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to historical acquisition activities. ","Intangible amortization expense was up $10 million sequentially, reflecting amortization of intangible assets acquired in the eFront acquisition.","Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.1% was down 210 basis points from a year ago, but up 120 basis points sequentially as US equity markets return to historic highs from a year ago.","Despite a more challenging overall revenue capture environment driven by current market volatility, we continue to see strong performance in future drivers of differentiated growth, including ETFs, alternatives, technology and portfolio construction, and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long-term. ","Our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","In connection with the previously mentioned eFront acquisition, which closed on May 10, we raise $1 billion in 10-year debt at a 75 basis point spread to treasuries. This represented the tightest credit spread ever for a 10-year senior debt issuance by a public asset manager.","As a reminder, in the first quarter, we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, repurchasing $1.6 billion worth of common shares. While we will be opportunistic in repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of the year, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock in the second quarter.","Quarterly net inflows of $151 billion were positive across asset classes, investment styles, regions and client types. Flows benefited from particularly strong demand across our fixed income platform, reflecting changing client preferences and validate our unique ability to partner with clients globally to meet their long-term needs in a variety of market environments.","BlackRock's institutional franchise generated a record $87 billion of net inflows, representing 6% annualized organic base fee growth. Flows were led by fixed income and reflected demand for our top-performing active strategies and liability-driven investment solutions.","Institutional active net inflows of $73 billion were driven by $59 billion of active fixed income flows, which included two sizable client wins. BlackRock's global insights and unique ability to offer holistic solutions are resulting in more significant strategic fundings than ever before.","Multi-asset net inflows reflected continued growth in our LifePath Target Date franchise and active equity net inflows of $3 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies where long-term performance remains strong.","iShares net inflows of $36 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, reflected continued growth in core fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs.","As previously seen in periods of significant market volatility, similar to the dynamic we saw in 2018, we saw outflows from higher fee financial instrument and precision exposure ETFs, which clients use to express real-time capital market sentiment and tactically allocate risk exposure.","Quarterly outflows from these products resulted in an iShares annualized organic base fee growth of 1% for the second quarter and had a dilutive impact on BlackRock's overall annualized organic base fee growth.","iShares crossed $2 trillion in AUM during the quarter and achieved the number one share of industry flows globally in the US and in Europe and in key product areas including fixed income, factors and sustainable ETFs. We continue to project a doubling of the global ETF market by the end of 2023, including significant growth in fixed income, factors and ESG, as well as in Europe.","Retail net inflows of $2 million reflected strength in BlackRock's municipal fixed income franchise and the event-driven liquid alternative funds as well as the successful close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II, BlackRock's largest closed-end fund launch in the last seven years and the industry's largest in the last five years. ","Momentum in our alternatives franchise continued with approximately $3 billion of retail and institutional net inflows in the second quarter. In addition, we have approximately $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.","Finally, BlackRock's cash management platforms saw $26 billion of net inflows as we continue to leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.","In summary, our second quarter results highlight the value clients place in our investment platform and our ability to use technology and risk management to develop broad-based solutions across ETFs, alpha seeking and alternative strategies.","While we can't control market volatility, the diversification and breadth of our business positions us to serve clients in a variety of environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth through economic cycles. We will continue to invest responsibly on behalf of clients and shareholders to execute our strategy for long-term growth.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.","For several quarters, I've spoken about the increasing depth and breadth of conversations BlackRock is having with clients. And this quarter's results demonstrates how those conversations are resonating, leading to significant strategic wins.","We generated $151 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth. Inflows were driven by a record activity in fixed income and cash and were positive across all client types, asset classes, regions and both active and index strategies as clients assessed the full breadth of BlackRock's platform in a more volatile environment.","The deliberate investments we have made in BlackRock's investment and technology platform are manifesting in the quality and quantity of our engagements with clients.","While our financial results are not immune to market volatility, as Gary described, we are having comprehensive conversations with more clients globally than ever before about outcomes and solutions, asset allocation, portfolio construction and investment and risk management technology.","The culmination of these capabilities and expertise into a one BlackRock approach gives us a distinct and unique global perspective and gives a distinct voice with so many clients around the world, and it's translating into a larger, deeper strategic mandates for BlackRock.","Following improved investor sentiment and global equity market rally through the start of year, macro and geopolitical uncertainty once again returned. The US-China trade tensions flared, renewing concerns about a slowdown in global growth, emerging markets equities have been negatively impacted and are down for the quarter; at the same time, US equities have hit a record high.","In Europe, while uncertainties around Brexit continued to weigh on investor sentiment, a focus on interest rate policy has also led to an unusual situation where a strong demand for safety has supported fixed-income price appreciation, while equities have been delivering income.","And after a period of rising rates, both the Federal Reserve and the ECB have shifted towards a more dovish stance. The market now expects several Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of 2020 and the ECB has highlighted a readiness to introduce new easing measures to address inflation shortfalls and hopefully to extend the economic expansion.","The combinations of these events, on top of a melt up in US equity markets, has driven a shift in risk sentiment in financial markets globally. Investors are derisking and rebalancing out of equities into fixed-income and cash in order to achieve their intended asset allocations in their portfolios.","As the investment landscape evolves, clients continued to turn to BlackRock. Today, clients are looking for better, more resilient portfolios that can help them meet their goals. They continue to demand transparency, value and convenience in addition to sustainable long-term returns and better long-term outcomes.","BlackRock's client-centered approach and skill positions us well to deliver on each of these client demands. As our investments in asset allocation, our investments in portfolio construction, a spectrum of investment solutions and technology, along our ability to bring all of those capabilities together that are generating growth and long-term value for BlackRock shareholders.","Last month, BlackRock crossed the 10-year anniversary of our announcement to acquire Barclays Global Investors. Our willingness to just disrupt ourselves and the industry by bringing active and index together is creating the foundation of what BlackRock is today. ","More importantly, what makes that transaction and each of our subsequent acquisitions so successful was our desire and discipline to integrate the organizations into one \u2013 one platform, one unifying global culture and one technology.","While we face a different landscape and a set of challenges now, the culture and the approach that drove us to that combination 10 years ago are just as relevant today, a willing to reimagine our business, to think comprehensively about our client portfolios and to innovate and to use technology in new ways, all to help meet our clients' needs. ","BlackRock's global voice is translating into large client wins with insurance companies, pension and wealth distribution partners. Our conversation with clients are about understanding their investment challenges and helping them shape and execute strategic portfolio construction decisions.","The strong organic asset growth we saw in the second quarter reflects this approach, and contributed to record institutional net inflows driven by a number of significant strategic client mandates.","As clients chose to de-risk and rebalance their portfolios, BlackRock saw significant demand for fixed-income strategies. We generated our second consecutive record quarter for fixed income with $110 billion of net inflows diversified across our active and index fixed-income platforms.","Inflows were led by $65 billion into active fixed-income strategies where performance remains strong with 82% and 86% of assets above the benchmark or peer medium for the third three and five-year periods.","We also saw increased demand in our cash management business which generated net inflows of $26 billion, representing a 23% annualized organic asset growth. Results benefited from client derisking activity as well as a number of significant cash client wins. ","In addition to the ability of our diverse investment platform that captures shift in client preferences across asset classes, long-term growth for BlackRock will be driven by a strategic positioning and our competitive advantages.","BlackRock has the most diverse investment platform by investment style, from index and ETFs to alpha seeking and to illiquid alternatives, which enables us to be the leader in the industry to do more towards portfolios construction, to have global scale and are increasingly establishing a local identity which positions us to capture growth in high potential markets around the world. And we have leading risk management and technology capabilities that serve the entire asset management value chain.","These differentiators align with areas of highest client demand and are fueling BlackRock's ability to grow faster than the industry average. ","iShares is one of those areas of highest client demand and generated $36 billion of net inflows in the second quarter. iShares captured the number one market share of ETF flows globally in Europe and the United States and a diversified mix of high-growth categories, including fixed income, factors and sustainable ETFs, as well as the core area of our ETF platform. Flows were led by fixed income and core and included $9 billion in net inflows into factor and sustainable ETFs.","We also saw clients use certain financial instruments and precision exposure ETFs to express risk-off views and tactical asset allocation decisions. It is the high secondary market liquidity and the unique options and lending markets around these ETFs that make them so valuable to institutional investors.","As Gary mentioned, risk-off and volatility-driven outflows from these higher-fee ETFs masked organic fee growth across other iShares categories, all of which are longer-term in nature. ","iShares crossed an important milestone in the quarter, reaching $2 trillion in AUM. This is just five years after reading $1 trillion and 10 years since we acquired the $385 billion franchise.","Importantly, 80% of growth over the last five years has been driven by client inflows and we remain confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs and we expect the industry could double in the next five years with iShares maintaining its market leadership.","We are investing in our platform to deliver high-quality exposures to clients globally and to increase the adoption of ETFs with new clients and for new use cases. For example, we are seeing more investors use fixed-income ETFs, which recently crossed the $1 trillion in industry assets. ","In an increasing number of ways, since BlackRock launched the first fixed-income ETF in 2002, these products have made it more convenient for all investors to access a diverse range of exposures.","Institutions are adopting them as replacement for their individual bond holdings to enhance efficiencies of their portfolio management process. Individuals are using them to help generate predictable income or as a part of a broader portfolio.","iShares fixed-income ETFs have also repeatedly demonstrated that they offer the clients an additional source of liquidity and transparency during the times of market stress.","The combination of BlackRock's history as a bond manager, our expertise in ETFs and industry-leading technology and data capabilities create significant differentiation for iShares in this space, and we believe this is just a beginning.","It took 17 years for fixed-income ETFs to reach $1 trillion in AUM and they still represent less than 1% of the $105 trillion global bond market.","We believe they are well-positioned to double to $2 trillion globally within five years, especially if secular forces like bond market modernization, regulation and a move towards portfolios will take effect and create that type of systematic demand.","Sustainable ETFs represent another strategic growth area for iShares as clients increasingly look for strategies that target a measurable ESG impact in financial returns. ","We launched iShares ESG Leaders Fund in the second quarter which generated over $1 billion of net inflows, representing the best asset gathering in an equity ETF launch in 15 years.","Since launching our iShares Sustainable Core ETFs in October, we have doubled assets to $13 billion and our clients' discussions suggest increasingly more client demand. ","Beyond ETFs and across our investment platform, we're seeing greater demand for ESG and for sustainable investments. BlackRock has invested to develop significant expertise in this space. We are leveraging our insights and technology to analyze sustainability-related risk and opportunities across asset classes, so we can better deliver long-term results and opportunities for clients across index, active and alternative investment strategies.","Demand for illiquid alternatives also remains strong as investors search for yield and attractive risk-adjusted returns in a sustained low rate environment.","We generated $3 billion of net inflows in commitments across our illiquid alternatives business in the second quarter, led by credit, infrastructure and private equity solutions. Our teams are consistently deploying capital on behalf of our clients with another $1 billion of committed capital deployed in the quarter.","As clients increase their exposure to private markets, they want more than individual alternative products. Increasingly, clients are looking for alternative solutions that fit in the context of their whole portfolios as well as technology to better understand risk and comprehensively manage portfolios across public and private markets.","BlackRock can offer clients both alternative investment solutions and investment and risk management technology. Our acquisition of eFront, which closed this quarter, further strengthens our positioning and ongoing growth in our illiquid alternative business and will be supported and enhanced by our eFront over time.","BlackRock's leading technology capabilities continue to support and enhance the strong results we are seeing across our entire platform. Technology services revenues grew 20% year-over-year, including the impact of eFront acquisition that closed in May.","We are excited to share that we've already received our first combined client win notification for an eFront contract, alongside an Aladdin contract extension. This early success is a reflection of the immediate collaboration and teamwork across Aladdin and eFront, and reinforces our value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world.","With Aladdin Wealth, BlackRock is enabling our wealth management partners to offer transparency and convenience to their own clients. Aladdin Wealth is giving advisors better capabilities to connect with their own clients and providing wealth managers with a better risk management portfolio construction tools.","Our goal is to make Aladdin Wealth the leading technology platform for wealth managers and deepen our value proposition with our partners and their financial advisors.","We seek strong momentum going forward as industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulatory requirements are creating the need for more holistic, more flexible, technology-driven solutions at both institutions and wealth managers.","BlackRock is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and is committed to enhancing our technology capabilities to continually meet our clients' needs.","Over the course of BlackRock's 30-year history and in the 10 years since the financial crisis and our acquisition of BGI, markets have experienced various periods of volatility and uncertainty.","I firmly believe that, in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer.","We remain focused on what we can control, bringing together the entire firm to serve clients, strategically investing in our competitive advantages and leveraging our global skill to be more disciplined in how we invest.","We are deepening our strength by adapting our businesses to meet challenging client needs, being a leader in the highest future growth areas of our industry and serving our clients more broadly than any firm in our industry.","By continuing to keep clients' needs at the forefront of our priorities, we will continue to be driving differentiating growth for our shareholders, and I'm confident we're very well-positioned for business for the future.","With that, let's open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JP Morgan.","Laurence Fink","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, really going after cash management and fixed-income sales, hoping you could talk about the pipeline for both. So, clearly, 2Q was huge. There was a sort of a change in the rate outlook, lots of repositioning. What portion of that repositioning might be left as we look forward there? ","And then, it seems like BlackRock was a disproportional winner in both fixed income and cash strategies. You did mention some of the drivers in your prepared remarks. But if you could, just maybe highlight the factors that you see which may have driven not only just good sales, but market share, win share as well.","Laurence Fink","Thank you, Ken. So, I would say, what we are seeing more than ever before, our clients are finding the management of fixed income more difficult if they in-house manage it. They're looking for deeper relationships, to have either windows to the market by employing firms like BlackRock to manage part of their portfolios in fixed-income and, in some cases, now they're looking to outsource their entire platform of fixed income. And they are looking for more of a technology solution as a component of that. And it just leads to what I've been saying each quarter, Ken, having this holistic outcome orientation with our clients is leading to these type of broad conversations. We have many deep broad conversations ongoing now and we don't see that type of behavior dissipating in terms of these types of big types of opportunities.","But a part of that also is just a systematic approach to fixed income where we're able to provide both index or ETF solutions alongside active solutions. And I do believe they coexist together. We are seeing more clients who employing ETF solutions for fixed income alongside active solutions. And so, having that comprehensive conversation, having the ability to source more product \u2013 and that's obviously in this environment now, smaller organizations are having a harder time sourcing, whether it's in the private credit markets or even in the public credit markets. And so, this is where scale is becoming even more important and also having that global footprint in terms of relationships is building these types of flows.","I'll let Rob talk about the cash side, but we've been saying this is a huge competitive opportunity for us and we think much of this has started to manifest in this quarter and we believe in the quarters to come.","Robert Kapito","So, let me just accent Larry's comments. So, the depth and the breadth of the conversations that we are having with clients is really resonating now and leading to these large strategic wins because clients are looking for a long-term strategic partner. So, these conversations are about understanding the investment challenges they have and helping them execute strategic portfolio construction decisions. And we have now the unique ability to offer a holistic solution. And this has to include technology, portfolio construction, modeling capabilities, have various asset allocation strategies that involve both passive and active strategies and includes trading and includes analyzing credits and it also includes balance sheet management.","So, all of these things have been more significant to get the strategic fundings than ever before, and I think the result you saw in this quarter really reflect this. And our clients are putting out an even greater premium on this differentiated value proposition that we offer.","Part of this is also cash. We saw $26 billion of cash management net inflows in the second quarter and we are now number three globally as a money market provider. And these flows come from both large separate accounts wins and strong flows into our institutional money market funds as we continue to innovate, leverage scale and deliver digital distribution and risk management solutions.","So, as a reminder, more than 95% of BlackRock's cash assets under management is institutional where we are differentiated with our scale, risk management and technology. So, we believe this differentiated set of cash offerings, including money market funds, separate accounts, CTFs, ETFs and other short duration strategies help us to serve our clients.","And lastly, I would say, in cash, we are transforming our cash management business by delivering distribution and risk management technology through a portal that we have called Cachematrix and also through Aladdin. So, we are creating a technology-first distribution strategy, and this is driving our success in cash as well as holistic approaches to get these large strategic wins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from Citi. Your line is open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Bill.","William Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for your comments and taking the question this morning. ","So, Larry, just want to step back a little bit and I was wondering if you could sort of help sort of frame out what gets the active equity market going again. And within that \u2013 at least from a flow perspective. And from within that, how does products like Precidian with ActiveShares play into that and then what might be the risk to the passive business, if any?","Laurence Fink","Let me talk about active equities and I'll let Gary talk about Precidian, but I wanted to say one comment about what does it do to passive ETFs. We had active positive flows in our equity business last quarter. It was in the form of a closed-end fund where we raised $1.6 billion and we saw good inflows in our scientific active equity team where we had great performance. ","Where you see with other assets manager where they have flows, it's all performance-based. You have to prove, over time, value for their money. This is one of the big things we've always been talking about. If you cannot show the value or the fees for their return, you're going to continue to see inflows in other types of products. You're going to continue to see more flows into alternatives because of the inability of getting active alpha in equities.","And so, when you think about a holistic approach, pension funds or insurance companies, they allocate their active risk across a whole spectrum of investment. If they don't believe they could get the value for their money in active equities, they're going to move that where they could get active alpha into more illiquids. So, that's the trend you're seeing. And so, you're seeing more of a transformation in the alternative space where they're getting more active alpha and you're seeing that's been barbelled by a predominance in ETFs.","So, if more and more managers can provide value for their money in terms of active alpha returns after fees, then we're going to see systematic more flows back into active in the equity side. And so, I'm not here to project that the whole industry active is going to have active returns. I think it's harder and harder as I've been commenting over the years about active managers producing active alpha with all of the democratization of information. It's becoming much harder to differentiate yourself, and that's what we've seen. And so, we have systematically been shifting our equity teams into more thematics, into more model based and scientific, into I would say more specific portfolios with fewer shares, stockholdings. And so, we believe that's where active equities is going to be migrating and we've been doing that over the last two years and now we're starting to see some of that success. ","On the rise of active ETFs, which I'll let Gary talk about, that will have no impact \u2013 and I underscore no impact \u2013 on index-based strategies. People are using index-based strategies for a purpose, and that is really the \u2013 getting back to my conversation about alpha allocation. So, when you think holistically about your alpha allocation, where are you going to get your active alpha? And so, that's the bigger issue more than anything. And I do believe, when people go into index-based strategies across factors or across sustainable types of products, those are more precision instruments, those are instruments that give them those type of reference. That's not going to change. And so, I'll let Gary talk about the Precidian, but if active investing becomes a larger component, then there could be an increased role of active ETFs. But let me have Gary talk\u2026","Gary Shedlin","So, Bill, I'll say just two things and then we'll move on. One is, obviously, BlackRock is a strong proponent of industry innovation and anything that basically enhances investor access to the markets, we're all for that. And, secondly, I would say that our goal for the future is to be wrapper agnostic. So, to the point Larry made, if an investor wants a passive product, a retail investor, they can choose between an index mutual fund or an ETF. If it's an institutional account, whether it's a co-mingle trust fund or a separate account. And I think similarly, to the extent an investor chooses they want an active product, we similarly think, if the future holds, that they can choose between a traditional mutual fund or an ETF. And that's good for investors, then we'll, obviously, make sure that we position ourselves to be part of that industry growth.","Early signs I think are still out. There are some benefits versus a traditional mutual fund for an active ETF in the concept. There's maybe more tax efficiency and less cash drag, but, obviously, there are still some complications as it relates to transparency, the implications that transparency has for creates and redeems and bid\/ask spreads and how that instrument is going to trade. ","And so, I think it's early days. We're going to continue to watch the development of the product itself and how it relates to the ecosystem around it and we will, ultimately, make the best decision for our investors going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Laurence Fink","Good morning, Patrick.","William Katz","Good morning, guys. I think, last quarter, you mentioned nine clients ramping up on Aladdin for Wealth and that it was still kind of early days in terms of seeing meaningful, identifiable, incremental organic growth from that. Could you update us on that number and maybe to what extent you're seeing more line of sight to increased adoption of BlackRock product through that ramp up process?","Robert Kapito","So, the biggest opportunity for Aladdin is to make it the language of portfolio construction for wealth managers, for financial advisors and also for individual investors. So, Aladdin is currently live with 11 clients globally. This is Aladdin for Wealth. ","We continue to see very strong client interest. I would caution you to say that, when we get an Aladdin assignment, there is sometimes three, could be as long as six-month implementation part of that before they come alive. And there's also, of course, ramp up fees that we have until they get large and they start to grow.","So, we are seeing more and more demand. And, quite frankly, for every one client that takes on Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth, it creates demand to become the standard in how people are going to look at technology. And what this does is simply brings risk transparency and portfolio construction capabilities, both in the institutional market and in the wealth market. ","And also, when we're having conversations about our risk technology, it also piques their interest in what we can do with their portfolios and balance sheets and adds on to other business that we might do with them and, quite frankly, vice versa.","So, when it comes to Aladdin for Wealth, there is a whole education process for advisors to use the technology and you can have any app you want, but you actually have to use it. And we're finding the increased interest is not only because of the risk technology it provides, it's becoming an asset gathering tool for these advisors.","So, our expectation is it's going to grow. We have more client interest in it and it's, I think, going to continue to grow as it's been growing in the past for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. If you could just guide into the nature of the active fixed income institutional mandate, I know you touched a lot about this on this, Larry. But if you can talk about maybe what do you think has changed for BlackRock in offering holistic solutions. Obviously, you guys have been well-positioned for that for quite some time, but you seem more optimistic on those types of mandates going forward. So, is it the technology that's linking in that's actually generating this growth or is it something else?","And then, just added to that is the fixed income iShares usage as substitutes for bonds. Are you seeing that as a fairly permanent secular trend that should help the fixed income grow quarter-in, quarter-out?","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Brian. I'm going to let Rob answer most of it, but this really is just a very vivid example of our positioning as an organization globally where our scale is bringing the ability to source assets, our consistency in performance, our agnostic ability to provide passive and active in fixed income. And so, it's really manifesting now as a deeper product conversation. But, Rob, why don't you\u2026?","Robert Kapito","Yeah, I think the quick and dirty answer is just that they need a strategic partner. It's not about just filling or checking a box with one particular product. So, when you can go and you can provide the technology to them, you can provide opportunities for modeling portfolios, portfolio construction, when you can give that answer and have the products in-house to give them the appropriate asset allocation, whether it be passive and active, whether you can actually trade and get the allocations to provide them the products that they need, whether you can do the credit work on their current portfolio and improve it, then whether you can actually look holistically depending upon what type of client it is and help them with balance sheet management because, in a period of low interest rate, every basis point counts. And that's were also cash comes in to be able to provide the appropriate allocations in that balance sheet to improve it or the portfolio itself. Really makes a difference in a low interest environment. So, that's where we're seeing the interest in having more dialogue with us because I think this approach is unique in our industry.","The second part is really what's driving fixed income to go more and more into an ETF structure. And you're going to hear a lot from BlackRock about this because there's really four or five different reasons.","One is, there is an evolution in portfolio construction and millions of people are actively using fixed income ETFs in new and innovative ways to achieve a variety of outcomes. So, keep in mind, it is still a great way to derisk your portfolios. It is a good way to have more liquidity, more transparency, more diversification and better tax. It's just a better wrapper.","There's growing adoption now by institutional investors. So, institutions like pension funds, asset managers and insurance companies rely on fixed income ETFs for very quick efficient market access. As the bond market now starts to modernize, electronification of bond markets are going to support the growth of fixed income ETFs as well as entrenched bond ETFs as part of a vibrant fixed income marketplace. So, technology is also helping this market to grow.","And then, as the previous question alerted us to, there's constant ETF innovation. This is the development of new bond ETF exposures. And what it's adding is the most important part of this, which is convenience of investors to access the fixed income market with better liquidity at a better price, and we are constantly now coming up with new tools to customize portfolios and drive future bond ETF adoption. It is right now a very small portion of the fixed income market. We are very optimistic about the future growth.","As Larry mentioned, global fixed income ETF assets under management crossed $1 trillion in June. And even at $1 trillion, fixed income ETFs represent less than 1% of the $105 trillion global bond market. So, we have high expectations for growth and we think we're going to benefit from the growth in this market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning, Larry. So, I wanted to see which of your recent investments in digital tools are providing BlackRock the biggest competitive advantages in our clients? And also, when you take a step back and look at your major competitors in financial services and firms that also have the ETF businesses like the Vanguard, Schwabs, JP Morgans with digital direct-to-consumer distribution platforms, what are your thoughts in entering the wealth management space at some point?","Laurence Fink","Gary?","Gary Shedlin","I'll give you an update on our investments. I think, obviously, we've made a number of minority investments, Craig, which are definitely part of our capital management strategy. I think we are looking to use our balance sheet and the stable cash flow that our business generates more aggressively to basically position us to effectively learn and partner with a number of very innovative companies without necessarily having to take full control day one. I think it basically helps us add value to their business and, ultimately, derisks our strategy of ultimately having the option to combine with those companies over time where, frankly, they may benefit from their unique culture and basically our broader reach.","So, today, we've basically got a number of them. Obviously, iCapital and Scalable are most well-known. Again, I think Scalable kind of expands our global advisor capabilities and what we've done with FutureAdvisor into Europe, which I think is very successful. iCapital, obviously, is more on the front end of the alternative strategy and will at some point really, whether we own it or not, will basically pair very nicely with what we're doing on an eFront-Aladdin technology combination.","We've, obviously, done other things even more unique and our minority investment into Envestnet, I think, has been incredibly beneficial, not only in terms of the fact that the stock has gone up significant since we bought it, but, more importantly, it offers an opportunity to get Aladdin on the desktops of thousands and thousands of RIAs in a way that effectively helps them not only benefit their own practices, but helps distribution of our underlying asset capabilities.","And then, there's a number of smaller issues, smaller companies, whether it's Embark or Acorns, again, which gives us an opportunity to learn about the evolution of distribution in a more technological way and to basically help these companies drive more value.","As it relates to the issue of going direct, we have no intention of going direct. We are an intermediated model. We partner with lots of companies who distribute our products. And, frankly, all of the investments that we're making are intended to basically be beneficial to our shareholders and to clients, but, frankly, respecting the fact that we are an intermediated model going forward. Larry?","Laurence Fink","And I would just say one on a more holistic basis. When I write my CEO letters, I focus on the societal changes. And we are seeing huge societal changes with more millennials and more Gen X and they are much more adept in using technology and we need to be at the forefront of helping them.","I do believe the retirement crisis in America is a component of lack of financial literacy. And so, anybody \u2013 it is all our respective jobs is to use technology to improve financial literacy and improve better transparency for people who are investing. We need to take the fear out of managing of money for most people. If we could reduce that fear of management of money, I think the outcome will be leading to more people putting their money to work, and that's one of the structural problems we see in Europe and other parts of the world.","And so, to me, it is only \u2013 it's going to have to be through better and more unique technology, and that is what's driving us to try to provide leading technology, Aladdin for Wealth, to create more transparency.","When you think about the movement, especially on the advisor side with more and more movement toward illiquids, when you think about iCapital and then eFront, if we could provide better transparency and information on the illiquid side alongside Aladdin for Wealth, it will lead to better financial literacy towards investing in illiquids. But it will probably lead to better outcome investing for everybody.","And so, when you think about how we are trying to design our technology and our technology offerings, it is all \u2013 the foundation is some of the things that I write about and how we can then take this and really build a unique position in all those societies we work in in terms of trying to provide better financial literacy, better financial outcomes. And so, that's the entire foundation of what we're trying to do.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and for the continued interest at BlackRock. Our strong second quarter results is really linked to really these deliberate investments we've made over time. And what I've been continuously talking about, our deep partnerships we've built with clients globally, being footprinted globally by providing a deeper purpose in all the communities we operate. We see meaningful opportunities that continue to leverage our differentiating scale.","BlackRock's purpose of trying to help people having and achieve better financial outcomes. We're trying to use our leverage to invest in our investments and technology capabilities for the ultimate value creation for our clients. And through the value creation for our clients is going to lead to longer-term deeper value for our shareholders going forward.","Everyone, have a good summer. Hopefully, people have some time to take off and we'll talk to you in fall.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"3347":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matt Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, I want to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, let's begin the call. Gary?","Gary Shedlin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. My pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014 as adjusted results.","Overall 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continue to drive shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth; demonstrating the benefits of scale through our operating leverage, and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders, even in an increasingly volatile macro environment.","As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our business model and evidence the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth of our global platform.","For the fourth quarter BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013, and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund to funds vehicles.","Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of non recurring items. While we continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional non-recurring items that arise during the year.","BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $88 billion of long term net new business, our highest ever quarterly net flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 8.3%.","For the full year 2014, BlackRock generated total long term net new business of $181 billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5% together with net flows from our cash management business, BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year.","During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in retail, and 1% in institutional in line with the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day.","This resulted in organic based fee growth in excess of organic AUM growth, as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster growing, higher fee retail and iShares businesses.","Equally important, net long term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year.","Fourth quarter revenue was flat with a year ago, as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014.","Fourth quarter base fees was 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies.","While the S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2% with emerging markets and natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12% respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our financial results as only 34% of our equity base fees are generated in U.S. markets.","In addition, ongoing dollar appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in long term AUM in the quarter.","Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million driven by a broader suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate and hedge fund solutions offerings. Performance fee decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which included a large fee associated with the partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund.","The decline also reflected relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends.","BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue.","Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi asset risk solutions.","Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While revenues benefited from meaningful transaction based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains well positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements attendant to CCAR and the new ECB single supervisory mechanism.","Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year, as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased levels of G&A expense.","Full year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher headcount and higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation to revenue ratio declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2% driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale across our platform.","Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, reflecting lower professional services and other G&A expense and various leased exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million primarily due to volatility in FX remeasurement, the planned seasonal uptick in year end marketing and promotional spend, and closed-end fund launch cost associated with the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust.","Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, a 150 basis point increase over 2013 levels.","Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points, while also significantly reinvesting in our business.","In line with that commitment, on November 5th, BlackRock entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment advisor to BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation.","This transaction enhances our fixed income platform to the addition of a middle market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2015.","During 2014, we were trying approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%.","As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level.","Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend on a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 22%.","Our Board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional $6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of $9.4 million shares, including $3.4 million shares which are remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013.","Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive both our active and index franchise, as well as in each of our geographic regions, with $62 billion from the Americas, $50 billion from EMEA, and $11 billion from APAC.","BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long term net inflows of $23 million during the fourth quarter, bringing full year inflows to $55 billion representing 11% organic growth for the full year.","As usual fourth quarter retail close reflect the seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions. Fourth quarter U.S. retail flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of products, including our top performing total return and high yield franchises, and our flagship strategic income opportunities fund.","SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the fourth quarter with nearly $5 billion of quarterly net inflows.","Our multi-asset income fund or MAI continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows.","Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock\u2019s fixed income, multi-asset and index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and ongoing outsource from our European equities franchise.","Globalized shares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the number one share of global ETF industry flows.","During the fourth quarter, iShares record fixed income flows were broadly diversified by asset class duration and geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market and were the global leader in fixed income inflows in 2014.","Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the core series with particularly demand for U.S. equity exposures. The core segment remains an important growth channel for iShares posting an organic growth rate of 30% in 2014.","Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past five years.","The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever changing needs of a sophisticated institutional client base and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015.","Barbelling continues to be a key theme, as institutional clients pair cost effective beta exposure with alternatives and other high conviction alpha solutions, to achieve uncorrelated returns.","We continue to see sizeable asset allocations driven flows both into and out of institutional index products, resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter.","Institutional index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset allocation decisions and solutions based LDI activity.","Institutional active net inflows based by positive flows and for fixed income, multi assets and alternatives, fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures and we continue to see institutional demand for our unconstrained strategies.","Multi asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions based wins, as well as continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite.","Excluding approximately $600 million of return client capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business led by hedge fund solutions and private activity solutions.","In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives raising nearly $3 billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum infrastructure debt, and renewable power.","Over the last two years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments, and have nearly $9 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only translates into flow and AUM as those dollars are invested.","Outflows from both scientific and fundamental active equities continued in the fourth quarter. By its strong performance, client demand for scientific active equity remains muted. Fundamental active equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues.","However, these flows were partially offset by select wins and categories where our new managers are building strong track records including large cap growth.","In summary, in the year marked by periods of increase volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and consistent financial results. We've remained confident that our differentiated business model is well-positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come.","And with that, I will turn it over to Laurence.","Larry Fink","Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. 2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing today and in the New Year.","However, markets proved resilient in 2014 and the fourth quarter marked the 8th straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with data suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy.","As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging European and Asian markets, and certainly outperformed natural resource markets and the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies.","This market divergence is likely to persist in 2015, creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors.","Anemic global growth has led to an overdependence on politicians to implement reforms to rebuild the global economies. But we have seen limited action globally from politicians and as a result, we continue to rely on accommodative central bank policies whether we\u2019re talking about Europe, China, Japan, and even at this moment even the United States.","This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar, as it will rise higher, as well as the mixture of regional policy successes and failures, again increasing more global volatility.","The technology revolution that most people always underestimate is so evident in the oil industry, and through this technology the growth and supply of oil is outpacing demand which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum markets with greater than a 50% drop in oil prices.","This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the world. With the high cost of energy production economies experiencing major headwinds, countries like the U.S., like China, like India, will be seeing huge benefits in stimulus.","In countries that have seen currency devaluation such as Europe in recent months will experience only modest and moderate gains.","We see more shocks as production decisions and the demand side equilibrium but overall this oil price movement should be a great benefit for the global economy.","With a back drop at divergent market performance, volatility, regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients near long term investment challenges are becoming more complex, but our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciaria and BlackRock is well positioned to address our client's needs and deliver return for shareholders in all market environments.","The combination of our global multi-asset platform, our insight and thought leadership and Aladdin, our unified technology and risk management platform has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we have ever seen before.","It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect the assets and in most cases generate alpha for our clients.","In the fourth quarter BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the whole year, BlackRock saw a long-term net inflows of $141 billion and together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than $200 billion in net inflows in 2014.","But I want to emphasize one important thing, it's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we raised, but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important.","For the year, we saw a $35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed income, $29 billion of flows in multi-asset and $4 billion in alternatives where we put the money to use.","We saw $55 billion of flows in retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these flows in all regions, from all investor types, and importantly in the face of wide range of economic and investment conditions.","What we like to highlight is there were 13 countries where we had net inflows of excess of $1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of the billion dollars for clients domiciled in 41 countries, demonstrating the increasingly global and differentiating nature of the BlackRock platform.","In addition, we added our first Aladdin client based in Latin America and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the world. As the nature of our client's investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require.","More and more, a single investment product asset class or style does not provide a sufficient long-term solution. BlackRock's business model, which was deliberately built to deliver a multifaceted solution to clients and BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across are truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternative strategies all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management has resulted in continued organic growth and revenue growth for the firm.","BlackRock saw 27 distinct retail in iShare products each generating more than $1 billion net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual retail in iShare products generated more than $1 billion in net flows compared to 43 such products in 2013.","The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment solutions. As Gary mentioned, we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our process, and our platform and those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014 and I strongly believe this will continue to differentiate BlackRock overtime in an increasingly competitive industry.","The strength of BlackRock's fixed income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed income performance and now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed income platform outperforming the benchmark or peers for the three year period and no single category was a primary driver of the $96 billion inflows we gathered this year.","Active index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained and core bond offerings and positive across all client businesses and we saw several key buy list ads across categories in 2014.","Our flagships strategic income opportunity fund or SIO raised more than $13 billion in 2014 and we now manage more than $31 billion across or unconstraint fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients.","BlackRock saw increased client interest in our total return fund, which is in the top 3% of our peer group for one year, for three years, and for five years. Total return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents the meaningful long-term opportunity for us.","Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2014.","Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShare franchise as I said earlier, generated more than $100 billion in net flow this year and was the industry leader inflows in the United States, inflows in Europe, and inflows globally.","We continue to focus on growing global iShare market share and driving global market expansion and we expect client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShare's growth.","We saw $32 billion inflows in our global core series in 2014 as by-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShare for efficiently constructing larger portions of their portfolio. IShare's are used as financial instruments where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative to individual securities, to swaps, the futures, and we are seeing a strong initial progress in this newly formed area of the marketplace.","And clients are also using iShare as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints to generate alpha with efficiency.","In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off some high iThinking, an innovative new initiative design to help distill market insight into clear actionable ideas for our client and matching them with different iShare solutions.","We continue to be product innovation - was evident in December when we launched our CRBN or our low carbon targeted ETF design for individuals and institutions we're focusing on environmental sustainable activity.","The United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial funding for this ETF and BlackRock now managed more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our platform.","2014 was a turning point for our institutional business and as we entered 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized manner, and our financial institution group businesses are great example.","In 2014, BlackRock was selected to manage mandates spanning multi-asset, fixed income, infrastructure debt, and its whole balance sheet outsourcing for global insurance clients driven by regulatory changes by M&A, and investors are looking for better ways to navigate in this low interest rate environment.","In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and Aladdin on evaluation on risk and advisory services and even acquisition support to our BlackRock Solutions business.","BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs of our clients and we do this with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in their own language, we understand their industry and we can partner with them to create their needs, to provide the most proper solutions to their issues.","Another area where we are creating tailored outcome is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging alternative solution business, where BlackRock is building a holistic multidimensional solution portfolio, leverages our full global platform.","We\u2019ve seen strong fund raising across our illiquid alternative product set, as the target of strategy we laid out on Investor Day unfolds.","BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014, across a variety of strategies including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power, and infrastructure debt.","We've recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey, which indicated that institutions are looking to significantly increase allocations to real estate including infrastructure.","In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our second renewal power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the industry. 2014, BlackRock rates commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in infrastructure debt.","Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction source and capabilities and abilities to act as an extension of our clients internal teams.","The tangible impact of the investments made to-date in our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than a 100,000 households.","We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental act of equity business and have seen meaningful impact on performance for some of our clients.","We\u2019ve seen a major improvement in the performance of our U.K. equity strategies, we generated top cortile performances as we had our three year anniversary and our new management team in Asian equities, and our European equity strategies as posted in leading market share and solid broad based three and five year investment performance.","The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focus on U.S. equities. We hired a world-class group of investors with strong processes and track record for generating alpha, we are now in our second year of the investment and seeing good progress, and hopefully we will improve on our investment performance. Although we have a lot of work to do, and quite frankly we\u2019re not at the space where I would like to be at this moment.","2014, was a challenging year for our active managers, with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds outperformed their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see many of our active teams deliver stronger performances in the environment especially in December.","Our basic value strategy achieved top quintile performance since the new manager inception, our large cap series, the strategy has improved from a second - to a second cortile from a fourth cortile, and our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top quintile over three years.","While our active business continues to feel the impact of plans balancing high conviction alpha strategies now with index exposures, the breath and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only skilled player in both active and index around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need.","We expect investor preference to vary over time and BlackRock stability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the future for our success.","Before I open it up for questions, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible dedication in 2014, in helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to provide solutions.","I\u2019d like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role following successful organizational changes earlier this year. And I\u2019d like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in 2014.","In retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares in 2014, we closed with more than $1 trillion in assets under management. In institutional, we garnered the best floors that we\u2019ve seen in over five years.","Since the financial crisis or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has grown EPS by 142% versus the S&P 500, growing at 76% and the S&P financial index growing at only 9%, highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies.","All of the areas I\u2019ve spoken about whether it\u2019s fixed income, iShares, or financial institution group, alternatives, infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time and we\u2019ll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients.","We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize the full scale of our Aladdin risk management and technology capabilities to meet our fiduciary duties to our clients and to deliver returns for shareholders in 2015.","With that, operator let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery","I think obviously some unusual dynamics have been helping the institutional fixed-income ETF usage but it is a question really about the long-term opportunity. You have been adding talent to the sales force there. I think given the need for customized portfolios and immunization of specific liabilities in that context, how do you envision fixed-income ETF shares fitting into institutional portfolio construction? I think it's a question about how you characterize the value proposition rather than any liquidity challenge they might help address in the fixed-income market.","Larry Fink","That's a good question. I'm going to let Rob Kapito answer that.","Rob Kapito","So, the fixed income ETFs have been in increased demand as people are learning about the product. We're still in the early stages not only of institutions using the product but retail using the product as well.","So there are three segments - there are the buy and hold segment where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed income portfolio for the beta and fixed income, and we have products that are focused on that.","The second thing is that as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons become very expensive and they are surrogates for example in swaps and futures where ETFs are now being used, in fact more than futures are being used. And as people learn about that, they add that into their portfolios.","On the other side of that, there also being used as we call it precision instruments where people are looking for a specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be investing it.","So, this is just a beginning of where fixed income ETFs go and as you know that the fixed income markets are much larger than the equity markets are. So we just see continued growth in that.","So for retail we\u2019re attacking that by adding on to our core series where we are adding products that can offer the full suite to what our retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs whether that be in high yield, in corporates, in treasuries, or just generic fixed income.","And then on institutions, because they\u2019re looking for more of a trading vehicle and they\u2019re looking for the transparency and they\u2019re looking for the liquidity, we\u2019re adding more specific type of precision instruments for them.","So, I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows and we\u2019re just - we just think this is a market that we're very positive on going forward.","And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios, getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper, it\u2019s more diversified and it\u2019s more liquid than the alternative, and I might add that's really important when you\u2019re in a low interest rate environment like we're in.","So, we look forward to more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area.","Larry Fink","And one other point, fixing ETF utilization is far less than equity utilization and the opportunity for that to converge quite a bit.","Luke Montgomery","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Good morning. I guess kind of building upon that and just thinking about your comment about substantial momentum in the institutional business heading into 2015, outside of what we just talked about there with the fixed-income ETF can you get a little more specific about where you see that demand and kind of maybe a way to characterize it versus previous periods in terms of either size or opportunity?","Larry Fink","Well, the momentum is as I said carrying on into 2015. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 I think much of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we have generated with some top decile performance in our core business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top quartile maybe top decile performance in high yield.","So across the board the performance in all the different fixed income products continues to be quite large and we\u2019re seeing more and more clients are just also using beta products for fixed income.","So, across the board we're seeing that but in terms of where we\u2019re seeing clients looking to put more money to work, we're seeing increased activity in the client contribution area where we\u2019ve had some rather substantial wins. We continue to see in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash, this is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year, obviously we didn\u2019t expect some of the activities that occurred but fundamentally you always see some very large activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So, it's across the board and it\u2019s geographically diverse too.","So we think this is going to continue but I must say with where rates are at this moment more and more clients are going to be looking for different types of expressions of exposure that I do believe with where rates are it's going to lead to more and more clients searching things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that and this is one of the reasons why we\u2019re so heavily invested in our infrastructure teams.","We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield whether that's a good strategy or a bad strategy. I specifically believe, rates are going to stay lower longer and I think the activities that you\u2019re seeing in Europe whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the greater possibility of QE from the ECB but continual easing in Japan and importantly as Chairwoman Yellen has said, she's going to be very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does.","So, I actually believe this just creates more money in motion and more opportunity for BlackRock especially with our flows.","Dan Fannon","Great. That's helpful. And then Gary, if you could please just characterize the budget and how your outlook for 2015 with regards to kind of core expense growth.","Gary Shedlin","I would say, let\u2019s break it down. I think that in terms of G&A, I think when we look at the fourth quarter on G&A obviously it was slightly elevated by virtue of some closed end fund launch cost, and obviously some FX measurement.","But I think once you kind of exclude those two items, I think the fourth quarter is generally a decent run rate for the year in terms of G&A.","And then more broadly as we think about margins, obviously notwithstanding some of the seasonality that we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, margins more broadly are dependent on lots of things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in our business and obviously the competitive compensation environment.","So I don\u2019t - our margin guidance really hasn\u2019t changed, as you know, we don\u2019t manage the business to a specific margin target and we remain ever committed to generating operating leverage, we\u2019re also reinvesting in the business.","Dan Fannon","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","First, I was wondering if you could provide a quick update on SIFI? Found new commentary from both the SEC and FSOC, especially related to some of the activities that it seems like they are targeting like ETFs, alternatives, derivatives, securities lending with those being pretty relevant for you guys.","Larry Fink","I don\u2019t think they\u2019re targeting any one product. I think you\u2019re investigating products where there is obviously large growth and where there is areas where you may have mismatches of liquidity and or you may have need for greater disclosure.","So, there is nothing new from our point. We are - if a regulator asks us to provide information we do that worldwide. We are embracing in a very positive way the movement towards the review of activities.","We will be the largest beneficiary if the market is perceived to be stronger or transparent, easier to understand by more investors we will be one of the largest beneficiaries of that event and so we are embracing the concept of better financial ecosystem for our clients and if that means greater disclosure, greater transparency, we will embrace that.","But I think it\u2019s incorrect to say they are targeting because I don\u2019t think they are targeting at all, the conversations we\u2019re having - there are open dialogues, they\u2019re expressive. We are providing information as asked. Obviously the dialogues are one dimensional asked, why can\u2019t we provide information - and that\u2019s all we know.","We presume these questions are being asked by dozens of dozens of different managers and - but we\u2019re up in this process and we will all wait and see alongside with you what the outcomes will be. And I think this will be quite granular, I think we will see how this plays out and - but unquestionably you\u2019re going to see probably different disclosure requirements or different liquidity issues in some products and by enlarge we're into more of that.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Larry. Very clear. Second question, 2014 was a year where we saw big pickup in pension risk transfers, pension closeouts. I was wondering if you have any thoughts on how this could trend in 2015 given some of the drivers like the change in the mortality tables? And given that BlackRock is a large manager of assets for clients on both sides of the aisle, pension plans, insurance companies, really maybe share some perspective here.","Larry Fink","I don\u2019t know how this is going to play out with where rates are today going forward. I think it\u2019s very hard in most cases to be closing up pension funds, but let\u2019s step back and why have we seen elevated pension closeouts because you\u2019ve had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last five years.","Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities and they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility because of the issues related to the pension fund. So, we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have used annuities and working with insurance companies.","As you said, we are in dialogue with many organization, some of the organizations are transforming the DB plans to DC. As I said, we\u2019re seeing elevated growth in our DC business in the fourth quarter and we expect that in the first quarter, and we are having dialogues with many, many institutions worldwide about the possibility.","But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see significant equity rallies it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of money to making sure that they\u2019re matched.","But I would say unquestionably BlackRock\u2019s global platform, the ability of having our strength in target date and in terms of DC plans and having like path on the DC side, we have a lot of components working with our clients whether it\u2019s LDI products which obviously will create a derisking and obviously we could help quite a bit in helping them think about how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risks.","But I don't want to call it unified across the board, I do believe depending on where each company is related to the liability. And as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues.","We've actually had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago and now how do they factor in this elongated aging process and are they properly matched.","So, but one thing is very clear to companies that have done the derisking, it is not a static one time event, they have to be constantly monitoring as depended on how the liabilities are changing. And as I said earlier, we are very involved in these dialogues, and I do believe this plays really well with our global platform of having great analytics and helping company think about it.","We have long period of time of being involved with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability matching type of products for insurance companies that plays really well into LDI and other areas for us.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks Larry.","Operator","You next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","I guess my first question is I am just going to capital management. You guys have certainly been very clear on how you think about capital management and you had the dividend increase that you just announced. But I'm just curious, if we look at the 250 commitment to share repurchase per quarter, that has been in place since the beginning of 2013 and I think since the end of 2012 GAAP earnings are up maybe about 35% or so.","So is it reasonable to be thinking that that kind of 250 base commitment may be subject to some upward revision, too, as you continue to scale the Company?","Larry Fink","Let see if Gary can answer this question.","Gary Shedlin","So I think broadly we remain committed to consisting capital management. I think that we spoke last year a little bit about some of the uncertainty in the environment which I think, clearly still out there I think Larry commented more broadly on it.","So consistent with that and as we've seen the earnings trajectory increase, we did obviously increase the dividend at our Board meeting yesterday by 13% to $2.18.","Our buyback program is clearly a function of a number of things. We've already mentioned beta and other reinvestment opportunities that we see, as Larry likes to say, it's data-dependent I think you mentioned that earlier.","But our expectation more broadly is for the year of the buyback program would be greater than the billion dollars that we repurchased last year, obviously we\u2019re going to watch markets as they evolve during the year and plan accordingly.","Robert Lee","Great. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up, and Larry I know you did mention you've had some nice wins in the DC space and this is the inevitable question about money in motion and fixed-income, but where do you think we are in the DC replacement cycle? I know you had talked about that in the past given strong performance you guys have had and how well entrenched or ubiquitous maybe one of your competitors has been. Do you feel that that is still in the early stages of that 401(k) replacement cycle, or is that kind of well underway?","Larry Fink","Well, I truly believe the successes we had in 2014, will continue in 2015. The composition of our successes in fixed income across so many different products whether it\u2019s unconstrained, high yield, total return, MIA, is a great indication of the rest of our platform and importantly where we believe continue flows will be.","On DC specifically, I think we're in the early component of that. We're in dialogue with many different contribution platforms and I do believe in the DC side, one of the reasons why we have the dialogue is there to strengthen our data products in fixed income, our strength in our index equities, our target date products, and because of the large and in depth conversations we have with our clients it\u2019s giving us a great avenue to help them think about how they\u2019re going to be thinking about the DC business.","As I said, our total return business - total return product in DC is in the top 3% for one, three, and five. So, you come across whether as I said, target date or other products we\u2019re in a very good position to win or clients pull the money as that money remains in motion.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.","Bill Katz","Larry, you went through just a ton of things that are working very well for BlackRock. But one area that seemed to not get that much attention was active equity. I am sort of curious just stepping back maybe for BlackRock and for the industry at large, where are we in terms of investor appetite for coming back into that type of product versus as you mentioned earlier the barbell dynamic?","Larry Fink","Well, the one area that I had a large amount of dialogue most recently is in factor based equity investing. That\u2019s the biggest most recent type of dialogue. So the one area where we\u2019ve done quite well is in the model base equities and we\u2019re still not seeing really any flows but we\u2019ve had now five years of great success there.","I do believe the traditional fundamental equity business is alive, it\u2019s not well, it had poor performance as an industry, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re alluding to. We\u2019ve seen great movement as an industry, movement out of maybe more of the fundamental investing into index.","But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more volatile market - I've been asked many times questions related, should I be in an indexed product with a great divergence because I can't capture some of the great opportunities that are going to be masked by the great failures.","So when you think about the energy market, if you think about an emerging market world context, China, India, is going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia, Nigeria, potentially Brazil, are going to be harmed by this, how do you play that.","And so this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta, factors, and I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha, but importantly in our actions related to fundamental equities, we\u2019ve always said this is a five year project, 2015 begins the third year.","We are committed to this and if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe in a world that one day you will have - whenever that day will be, higher rates, it generally means - historically you would think this is a better environment for stock picking in fundamental equities.","So our model is purposely built and positioned to benefit on this active and passive world, but the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do believe the most neglected component of the equity investing is basically model or factor based investing where we have a great platform, we\u2019ve had great returns specially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component of our active equity area and I am quite frustrated to be frank that we haven\u2019t seen the momentum that I thought we would, but this is an area where in my most recent meetings, last week in Asia, every client asked about factor based investing in a divergent world.","So we\u2019ll see how that plays out, Bill. But I do believe in this divergent world and the way we are built the model of BlackRock will be a beneficiary of that.","Bill Katz","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Larry, if you can just comment on the inflow situation from the money in motion and PIMCO and other competitors in terms of your fixed-income franchise and do you think a lot of that went into the ETF component and might shift over as those investors reallocate throughout the year? And do you still see that as a tens of billions opportunity next year?","Laurence Fink","We see because of where rates are and the expectation where rates might go, I think people are focused on having a higher allocation to a fixed income ETFs and the R&D generics.","And there is a lot of money in motion because of people's plans for fixed income and rate of use for fixed income this year. And certainly because some money is flowing from various competitors and I think that\u2019s money because of the rates are, because of the fees are in general in the asset management business that EPS will see a larger percentage of [indiscernible].","Rob Kapito","I just had one thing. There is so much noise about our West Coast friend and competitor. Much of the money in motion is totally in related to what's going on there. I think there is more dialogue going on because of this low rate environment and how should that be played out.","And I think that's the compelling story. How does an income oriented investor whether it\u2019s an insurance company, a retiree who is struggling to meet the income needs of the \u2013 this is where we are in much greater dialogue. I have had great dialogue on where interest rates are and what does it mean for some of the largest suburban wealth funds.","So, I think the dialogue start with the macro environment and how to play it. And that is the most forceful reason why there is so much money in motion. Obviously you have cyclical changes in one manager versus another but that's always evident in the marketplace. And I think it is just weighing too much commentary related to that and its masking what lower rates are doing related to client's needs.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Larry Fink","Yeah, let me just touch on one more thing. Our fourth quarter and full year results as I think we have kind of expressed in our formatted speeches and in the Q&A, truly highlight the diversity and the differentiated platform of BlackRock.","We are seeing the impact of our large scale investing that we made over a year and we are continuing to make those large scale investing in infrastructure and equities. We're going to continue to make these investments and those investments are going to pay-off in the next few years.","And I think it\u2019s vital to understand that we believe this differentiated platform is the key component of what is been delivering, this type of compounded growth that we have had on behalf of our clients for our shareholders.","And I think that will continue and most importantly what I'm proud of as an organization we were able to deliver these investments and I'm not here to tell you all investments paid off, but we\u2019ve been to continue to deliver these investments. And at the same time as Gary discussed, we saw a consistent increase in our margins over the course of the last five year.","I think this is what differentiates BlackRock and I'm certainly not suggesting that we\u2019ll continue forever. But I do believe that continual investment in people, I have to remind people, three years ago we only had \u2013 we had less than 10,000 employees. Today, we have 12,000 employees. This is just an investing in our platform, investing in our client connectivity, and investing in products and in most cases we're delivering.","And this is something that really has given us that differentiated business model. And I do believe it's going to continue to drive our future at BlackRock.","So, I just want to thank you everyone for taking the time this morning. And thank you for your interest at BlackRock. Have a good quarter and hopefully the next few weeks are going to be little less volatile than the last few weeks. So enjoy.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2017.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.","BlackRock\u2019s competitive position has allowed us to continuously invest from a position of strength and to adapt and change our business model, always with a goal of being prepared to deliver outcomes for clients by leveraging a comprehensive set of technology and risk management capabilities. This strategy has fostered deeper client relationships and led to a differentiated and more consistent level of organic growth.","BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results reflected $80 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7% and an annualized organic base fee growth rate of 5%, highlighting the value of these investments and the success in our broad-based global technology and investment platform. ","Flows were positive across product type, client type, and region. First-quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 8% higher than a year ago, and despite costs associated with the repositioning of our active equity business, operating income of $1.2 billion rose 10%. Earnings per share of $5.25 were up 24% compared to a year ago driven also by higher nonoperating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $42 million of net investment gains, an increase from the first quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter. First-quarter net interest expense included $14 million of call premium expense associated with the current quarter\u2019s successful refinancing of our $700 million, 6.25% notes, which were called prior to their September 2017 maturity. Our issuance of $700 million of ten-year notes yielding 3.25% will result in a reduction of $21 million of annual interest expense going forward. ","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was 23.8%, compared to 29.6% a year ago, and included an $81 million discrete tax benefit associated with the adoption of new accounting guidance related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2017, so the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year.","First quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year, driven primarily by the positive impact of market appreciation and organic growth on our average assets under management. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees were approximately 9% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. Growth in both year-over-year and sequential base fees was partially offset by the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter of 2017.","Performance fees of $70 million increased $36 million from the first quarter of 2016, reflecting better hedge fund and long-only performance, but declined $59 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter.","Aladdin revenue of $158 million, was up 12% year-over-year driven by new clients and several sizable implementations going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Internally, we recently realigned financial markets advisory for our FMA business with client solutions and the BlackRock Investment Institute to offer clients a more cohesive and comprehensive advisory service.","To better align our external reporting in light of this change, Aladdin revenue, previously reported within the Blackrock Solutions and advisory line item on our income statement will now be presented as technology and risk management revenue on our P&L. Advisory revenue associated with our FMA business will now be combined with other revenue and included as part of an advisory and other revenue line item.","Technology is changing how the world invests and how we interact with clients. We continued to see strong market demand for institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, FutureAdvisor, and other technology solutions as clients seek sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools. This new presentation, which is reflected in our first quarter income statement, is intended to sharpen the focus on our technology and risk management businesses at BlackRock.","Total expense increased 6% year-over-year and 1% sequentially driven by higher compensation and volume related expense, lower G&A expense, and $22 million of certain one-time expense associated with the recently announced strategic repositioning of our active equity platform.","Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $78 million or 8% year-over-year, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven primarily by higher performance fees and higher operating income, and approximately $20 million of severance and accelerated compensation expense associated with the repositioning of the Active Equity platform.","Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 4%, reflecting these repositioning costs, higher seasonal payroll taxes, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to new 2017 grants, partially offset by lower incentive compensation resulting from seasonally lower performance fees and operating income in the current quarter.","G&A expense was down 5% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary, marketing, and promotional spend. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $54 million from the fourth quarter or 15% primarily reflecting the seasonal impact of lower marketing and promotional expense in the first quarter and reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense.","Aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional expense, which we anticipate will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2017. Assuming stable markets, we continue to expect a modestly higher level of full year G&A spend in 2017 as compared to 2016.","Our first quarter as adjusted operating margin of 42.6% was up 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting a continued focus on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders. ","We also remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we previously announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. ","First-quarter long-term net inflows of $80 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and regions. Long-term net inflows benefited from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients increased their use of ETFs as the building blocks for their portfolios and in combinations to drive active returns.","Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $64 billion; representing 20% annualized organic growth, driven in part by an accelerating global shift to fee-based advisory in the wealth channel and by rapid adoption of iShares ETFs as financial instruments by professional money managers.","iShares captured the number one share of first quarter industry [indiscernible] globally in the US, Europe, and in equity and fixed income with our US iShares franchise crossing over $1 trillion in assets under management for the first time. IShares equity and net inflows of $45 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $20 million were led by flows into investment-grade corporate and emerging market bond funds.","Our institutional business generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven primarily by index inflows. Institutional active net outflows of $1 billion reflected net outflows in equity and fixed income, partially offset by inflows into multi-asset and alternatives. multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target-date series, which saw $5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, the strongest flow quarter in recent history.","Excluding return of client capital, institutional alternatives generated over $2 billion of net inflows, reflecting deployment of committed capital in infrastructure and private equity and hedge fund solutions. Momentum in alternatives is continuing evidenced by yet another strong fund raising quarter for illiquids as we raise more than $2 billion in new commitments.","Illiquid alternatives remain a key growth area for BlackRock as further demonstrated by our recent announcement of the acquisition of the First Reserve Infrastructure funds. We expect this acquisition to close later this quarter bringing total invested and committed infrastructure capital to approximately $14 billion.","Retail net inflows of $5 billion were led by inflows into fixed income and index equity products, partially offset by outflows from world allocation strategies. Fixed income net inflows of $5 million were diversified across our top performing platform and included $2 million of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into emerging markets and municipals. In addition, our multi-asset income strategy raised $1 billion during the first quarter as investors continued to target specific income oriented outcomes.","Our first quarter financial and business results reflect the benefits of the investments we made to evolve our global distribution, investment and technology platforms ahead of evolving client needs and industry trends. Diversification, whether investment style, distribution channel, product for region and scale create a truly advantage competitive position that will enable us to continue making strategic investments with the goal of delivering long-term value for clients and shareholders alike.","With that I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call.","BlackRock\u2019s first-quarter results are a reflection of the purposeful investments we have made over our first 29 years to create the broadest investment platform in the asset management industry, and complemented by a global distribution network and industry-leading technology.","Our full range of investment strategies with strength in index, factors, smart beta, quantitative and fundamental actives and alternatives uniquely position BlackRock to develop a more holistic relationship and connect deeper with our clients. Our strong results this quarter are not a result of what we did over the last three months, but really a result of our long-term strategy.","We have always kept our focus on the long-term working to understand the evolution of the asset management ecosystem and to anticipate changes in our client\u2019s needs so that we can adapt ahead of change and better meet their needs. For this reason clients today rely on BlackRock not only for investment solutions, but also for our insights and guidance on how to navigate the global investment landscape.","Over the past year, global events have had a significant impact in markets and investor sentiment. Following the presidential election, US equity markets surged to an all-time high driven by expectations for fiscal stimulus and regulatory reform, and reflation expectations have been steadily increasing, although, there is still uncertainty about healthcare, uncertainty about tax and trade reform, when they will be ultimately be implemented in the United States and investor confidence has partially changed. There are significant issues related to tax reform, infrastructure spending, and so we need to see how this all evolves. We are still optimistic, but we have to see how these all evolve. ","Strong first-quarter equity returns have been driven by a synchronized recovery in global economic growth with the sharpest recovery seen internationally. However, it is unclear how social and political agendas will play out, particularly in Europe ahead of several elections, which is creating even more market anxiety. Furthermore, if the dollar remained strong following a period of significant appreciation we could see further headwinds for dollar-based investors with global portfolios.","Despite recent action by the Federal Reserve, the impact to sustain low rates in our clients\u2019 portfolios will continue. Many clients today are struggling to meet their liability needs and will likely to continue and will likely remain a challenge. As I talk about in my recent Chairman\u2019s letter to our shareholders in our annual report, at the heart of BlackRock is the culture that embraces change. We as an organization, we anticipate, we prepare, and we transform change into opportunities. ","As the landscape for asset managers evolve, a challenging narrative has emerged across the industry, one of managers having to play defense to protect themselves from market headwinds, structural changes and fee pressure. The reason much of the asset management industry is in defensive is that many managers have not evolved and they are playing catch-up. We built BlackRock differently. Evolution is a part and a critical part of our culture.","Throughout our history we have focused on identifying critical trends. We anticipated how those trends will impact our clients\u2019 needs and then we pivot our business accordingly. As a result, we built [Indiscernible] equipped with investment strategies and technology, one that is agile. We seek to adapt ahead of change, not in response to it. However, we also recognize that sometimes we make a misstep and addressing those quickly is just as important.","BlackRock has a full range of investment strategies for market cap weighted index exposures at one end to liquid alternatives at the other and everything in between. We have created technology capable of bringing those building blocks together to design and deliver outcomes for our clients, and we have built unmatched scale that strategically positions us to create value for our clients and our shareholders.","Now is the time more than ever for BlackRock to play offense. Our scalable investment and technology platform is our greatest durable competitive advantage and going forward we will continue to identify opportunities to use our advantage market position to create better financial futures for clients and drive long-term growth for shareholders. We are using our scale to lower prices for clients and drive growth and market share increases for BlackRock in our US iShares core ETFs.","We are using our scale to create more efficient relationships with our service providers, and earlier this year we announced our plans to move $1 trillion of custodial assets. We are using our scale to build industry leading technology to optimize investment performance and outcomes for our clients. We are using our scale to enhance our talent profile by tapping into a diverse network and we are using our scale to make tactical, fill-in acquisitions that further enhances our platform, our technology capabilities and our geographic reach.","This approach is widening our competitive advantage and driving our ability to generate consistently strong organic growth. And we are going to continue to press our competitive advantage going forward always with the best interests of our clients and our shareholders.","In the first quarter BlackRock generated $80 billion of long-term net inflows representing a 7% annualized organic growth. Flows were positive across product types, client types, and all our regions. Rugged ETF flows are a tangible example of the fundamental change we see in the ecosystem of wealth management and capital markets. ","Simple building blocks like iShares core has a strategy holding for long-term investors. Fixed income ETFs alongside bonds for institutions, large asset owners taking greater control of portfolio risk profiles with factor based ETFs, and more and more investors are using a combination of ETFs to generate active returns. The investment landscape is changing and BlackRock is investing in iShares to lead industry growth and evolution.","IShares saw record first quarter inflows of $64 billion as clients saw ETFs in their portfolio, both for index exposures and as building block to deliver alpha. Last October, we anticipated key changes impacting our retail and institutional clients that would change the way large pools of assets will be managed. We made a deliberate strategic investment in our US iShares core ETFs, positioning this business to offer the highest quality product at the best value for our clients.","This strategy is working, posting organic revenue and asset growth that exceeded our expectations. Since this strategic repricing we have seen acceleration in growth in our iShares US core ETFs with $52 billion of net inflows representing a 50% annualized organic growth. We have experienced a sizable up tick in our core market share, and we have recaptured more than 50% of the revenue impact through organic growth alone.","Several years ago we anticipated growing interest from our clients in factors and smart beta. Those strategies remain a significant area of focus for BlackRock and BlackRock is positioned to win. We saw $2 billion in net inflows into BlackRock\u2019s smart, Beta ETF in the first quarter contributing to the total factor base net inflows of $3 billion in our first quarter. The combination of our technology platform, our distribution connectivity, our commitment to risk management and our broad investment platform will enable us to be a leader in this space. We believe in active management more than ever before especially in less efficient markets where returns are less correlated. But we will believe going forward clients will be looking for different ways and different things from active equity and assets will need to be generating in the new ways. In October, we refined and expanded our active fixed income platform. 90% of our U.S. fixed income mutual fund platform now offers top quartile performance and top quartile pricing. Our constraint product range is also well positioned for rising rate environment and we are beginning to see momentum with over $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter.","As active equity management is being reshaped by massive advancements in technology and data science and clients are focusing more on outcomes, we recently reevaluated our active equity platform so that we are in a position to efficiently and consistently deliver investment performance to our clients. We spent our product offerings into a range of strategies that expand different levels of alpha-generation and value with the appropriate manufacturing cost for BlackRock and we are harnessing the power of people and technology as we lean into supporting both our fundamental and our quantitative equity managers with the sheered data science and technology capabilities.","We believe that levering our global scale and technology we can drive better outcomes for our clients and future growth for BlackRock. To the end of the quarter 65% of our fundamental active equities at 85% of our scientific active equity assets were above the benchmark medium for the three year period. The investments that we made in iShares shares and our active fixed income and an active equities are about leveraging our breadth, our scale and our technology to reach the benefits of competitive advantages to drive growth and we will continue to find ways to lever those unique strikes.","As we look for other opportunities overall for our clients alternatives remain a key area focus as our clients increasingly are searching for additional sources of income and hopefully uncorrelated returns. We saw another strong fund raising quarter with $2 billion of commitments and we now have more than $12 billion un-invested committed capital to invest going forward across our $100 billion core alternative platform. We continue to advocate for infrastructure investing and supportive policy to unlock private capital which offer multiple benefits including providing new sources of return for investors, creating jobs, improving productivity and increasing capacity for long term economic growth. Today we manage $30 billion in real assets and we expect this to continue area of growth for BlackRock. As we look to enhance BlackRock global credit platform last month we brought [indiscernible] to lead BlackRock's credit business along [Indiscernible]. We believe that the combination of BlackRock long established presence and expertise in fixed income and our growing alternative platform positions us to be a leading provider in both liquid and in-liquid credit which provides attractive risk adjusted opportunities for our clients for seeking differentiated source of income.","Well, technology has always been a key differentiator for BlackRock it is more essential to our business than ever before. We believe technology can transform our industry with enhanced technology and risk management helping investors achieve better outcomes and we at BlackRock are leading that transformation. Our goal is to be the most sophisticated user of data and technology in the financial services industry. We seek to transform and integrate the way the assets and wealth managers are creating client outcomes through portfolio construction asset allocation, risk management and digital distribution. Our Aladdin technology is being used by more clients than ever before well with revenues growing 12% year-over-year and demand from Aladdin\u2019s multi-asset capabilities by institutions globally specially in Europe and Latin America remain strong.","We also continue to see momentum in retail demand for Aladdin as interest continues to increase for Aladdin risk for wealth management which provides intermediaries with institutional quality portfolio construction modeling and risk management technology. We are currently implementing a handful of clients in this technology in the United States, in Europe and in Asia. Aladdin remains the only integrated investment risk management system on the market. And we believe this differentiation will continue to drive the attractive value proposition and premium price points. In line with the commitment to technology we recently nominated Chuck Robins to our board of directors. Chuck has helped global corporations navigate world being reshaped by technology advancements. We have consistently and consciously developed our board with the eye towards the future and Chuck brings a deep understanding of technology promise to our board at a critical time for BlackRock.","Building a record total net inflows of $202 billion in 2016, we began 2017 by continuing to invest in our business to capture the opportunities ahead of us to drive continued growth, and to aggressively leverage the benefit of our scale. We are transforming the change around us into the opportunities for the future. Finding new methods to generate sustainable alpha, using technology and innovative ways building no our platform to server clients evolving needs, creating continued opportunities for our employees and delivering consisted returns for our shareholders.","Now let's open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Larry in a Bloomberg interview you stated that Aladdin -- you see Aladdin pushing about $5 billion of revenue in the next five years. Maybe can you talk about what Aladdin would look like as a $5 billion revenue business and maybe what might be the greatest risk that could prevent BlackRock from reaching these targets?","Laurence Fink","I said that was an aspiration, let\u2019s be clear. And it was technology not just Aladdin. So we believe what we are doing in with our FutureAdvisor platform, with our iRetire platform, and of course in Aladdin for wealth management, Aladdin for institutional clients, Aladdin provider for the custodial banking industry. We believe we have great growth potentials worldwide. As I said in my prepared remarks we are seeing Aladdin interest in LatAm, in Europe. We have wealth management -- Aladdin for wealth management integration going on right now in Asia, and so it's continuing to drive our platform, but I am \u2013 where I am most pleased and I think has been the evolution of Aladdin beyond what it\u2019s core competency was a few years back by allowing \u2013 by having the ability to work with our wealth management clients and helping them having the analytical capacity to analyze the risk of every single client they have. And so especially in a world that is moving with MiFID II with a world that is moving more towards advisory-less brokerage, I believe the need for greater oversight, greater understanding is going to be necessary, and the Aladdin platform is one of the options that many people have to drive that technology knowledge. So and then, we will continue to do acquisitions, we have few areas that we are looking at right now to further add opportunities that we have in technology.","But let me just say importantly what technology is for BlackRock. It's the core of our culture. So it\u2019s and what I do believe what our clients are finding when they have the Aladdin platform and when you have the singularity of one technology platform throughout an organization, it's driving our clients\u2019 culture, and I do believe this is going to continue to drive a component of the growth that we see for Aladdin, so we are quite excited. At times, we are pretty overwhelmed with the opportunities but Mr. Goldstein and team have done a very good job in terms of driving those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning Larry. So if you look at BlackRock\u2019s strong AUM growth over the last three years and contrast it to the slower revenue and EPS growth trends, and I -- we know large component that delta is driven by one time market factors like FX and divergent beta, but when you focus just on the fee rate, can you provide us a rough estimate of the impact from the market driven factors and then also the client driven factors when you think about negative mix shift towards core series and fee cuts, and I am just really looking for kind of ballpark figures here?","Gary Shedlin","Hey Craig, it's Gary. Good morning. So maybe I will take crack at that for you. I think if we can start, recall from investor day which was I guess about nine months ago, we showed the chart on investor day that detailed how despite growth of about $1.3 billion on our base fees, and I think it was from 2012 to 2015, so that chart is a little outdated now, despite that growth our fee rate had actually declined by little over 1 basis point. I think it was about 1.3 basis points. Organic growth drove about 30% of the revenue growth over that period of time, and actually expanded our fee rate by about 1 basis point. That, I would basically refer you to as mixed shift and that is a phenomenon where our organic base fee growth is actually growing faster than our organic asset growth which frankly with the exception of last year, it has done pretty continuously. While beta and FX and drove about 70% of the revenue growth, which again our elements outside of our direct control had actually caused a 2 basis points decline in the fee rate over that time period, and that is really what we talk about as being divergent beta, and FX actually increases our revenue but it actually decreases our fee rate, and if you think about it, pretty simply the S&P has significantly outperformed global and emerging markets, and we have seen significant dollar strengthening by somewhere between 20% and 25% versus the pound in the Europe. And what does that do to us, that actually causes our dollar denominated assets to increase, which have lower fees versus products in Europe and Asia and especially in the emerging markets.","Now bear in mind, over that time period, there really were no meaningful fee cuts to speak of, but obviously we did launch the core in the fall of 2012. Last year, just to true-up that chart, the fee rate declined about 1 basis point despite another year of positive organic fee growth in a tough market and I think we have talked a lot about that where the trends were generally the same. But if you look back whether it was, we really generated organic base fee growth of 6% in 2013, in 2014, and 2015; and while it dipped 1% last year we generated 5% organic base fee growth in the first quarter and that's even with the fee cuts that we have announced both in fixed income and iShares. So I think the bottom line really is divergent beta and FX in many cases, which is re-pricing in some respects $5 trillion of assets everyday, but I also think that we are as Larry mentioned we really feel that we are as well positioned as we have ever been to grow not only assets but also base fees in a variety of markets and really differentiate ourselves in terms of organic growth through a variety of market cycles.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.","Bill Katz","Okay. Good morning and thank you so much for taking the question this morning. Just coming back to the dynamics of fee rates for a moment I think in that same article that reiterated likelihood that fee rates will continue to work lower in the industry which I think is pretty widely understood now. So my questions is when you start thinking about the conversations you are having with the retail distributors at the point of, around point of sale economics what's happening with that dialog because the way I see is that that's sort of like a fixed rate somewhere 5-10 basis points and as I imagine fee rate continues to work lower than economic margin are under a lot of strain in my view and is technology the answer how do you sort of explain to that plays out?","Laurence Fink","I mean, look Bill I think fee rates going down, I think as a reality of what's happening some of that is mix shift some of that is changing regulation in terms of distribution. Some of that will ultimately, will all accrue to the benefits of the end client. I think ultimately this comes down to our ability to generate sustainable alpha I think if we can generate sustainable alpha in a way that in some ways kind of captures three to four time the fee overtime I think will be fine. If we are in a period of significantly lower returns and lower sustainable alpha then obviously I think the fee rates are going to have to come down accordingly.","Gary Shedlin","So let me just add to that. One of the things that is happening is that the financial advisers are looking for lower cost products. So first there was shift and they need to go to a firm that has a wide range of products both active and passive and then secondly they need to look where they can find best value at the best price. Both of those really bode well for BlackRock and that is why Larry used the words in his brief deliberate and strategic investments that we are making. So we are making those investments in those core types of products that we know the financial advisers will need to be able to do the appropriate asset allocation they need at the best value and the best price. So that shift is actually moving in our direction.","Laurence Fink","Let me just put it into a different context to, I think this is missing in the narrative. There is a greater believe that long term return are structurally lower than they were 10 and 20 years ago. So if you have an expected long term return of let\u2019s say 6% which many people think there might be high when you look at balance portfolio? Fees take up a lot of that return. And as long as we believe the world is going to be in a low return environment our clients are under a lot of pressure. And clients are looking for different ways of seeking those outcomes. And this is why I actually believe why more clients are coming to us now because they have the structural problem. Their liability or their actuarial needs are greater than they can earn with our asset base and so they are looking at them or they are looking to have less expensive product but they are looking for a much more holistic solution and I think the era where a manager sold a product a sole product that is what's being threatened today. And as Rob just said we are in a great position with our clients to try to help them with these really difficult issues we have had a couple of state funds announced that they are lowering their actuarial rates that's very hard to do if a state fund lowers their actuarial rate that means they have to go to their union and say pay more that means they have to go to state and say contribute more. And so, this is one of the real issues that I think is being lost it's being so when you talk about or when we talk about fee pressure fee pressure comes from the real issue of lower expected returns and I think this is one of the big issues around hedge funds and why we are constantly reading about some hedge funds closing some hedge funds are lowering their fees because the fee structures are just too large versus the returns on a risk adjusted basis that they are achieving so this is a broad based issue. It's not just in the wealth management area. It's across spectrum of clients. I know I am belaboring this point but I think it's a very important point but this is the environment we all live in. and I think this is the environment that really positions BlackRock in a very differentiated way. So we understand this problem we are dealing with this issue and we are taking advantage of it. I believe it that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Hi there. How are you doing? Yes, I guess many of questions, just on you mentioned in the past and more recently some investments on like the tech side, artificial intelligence new machine learning and just wanted to get a sense like when we think about that opportunity you are looking at it more like from a product, from the active teams using those as tools being able to help clients out is it a cost initiative. Just wanted to get some granularity on where do you see kind of the opportunities around some of these investments?","Laurence Fink","Let's be clear. Technology creates efficiency across everything so we look at technology not just for portfolio construction, portfolio management we are using it for clients connectivity we are using it for efficiencies within our platform. The technology advancements we made in Aladdin related to dealing with the custodial banks saves us large sums of money. So I want to talk about technology is changing every component of our firm. And I think this is one of the reasons why our margins have been consistently strong by the utilization of technology across all the spectrums.","You ask specifically related to technology, related to investing because the advancement in technology, because utilization is centered technology, because the internet playing a role in everything and anything we do there is information that we could not search for four, five years ago, whether it is communication by employees about their firms and consumer sentiments about product and so by having the ability to deep dive on data interpreting that data through different algorithms and models hopefully we will be creating excess alpha so it creates product, creates product returns and so that's where we look at the greatest amount of advancements.","We are also looking at computers and can computers be learning and adapting in markets. But that's something for the future. But importantly, technology today for data analysis, technology for very quick analysis of that data is going to be really the key component of driving I believe returns in active investing in the future. And I do believe because technology has created the efficiencies it creates more efficiencies across and we can pass on those efficiencies also to our clients and I think this is one thing that's being missed here we are, we talked about some of the fee cuts and yet we have an increase of 100 basis points in margins.","So we look at technology as a great efficiency provider for investing for custodial assets, for communicating with our custodial clients, for communicating with our employees, for communicating with our clients. So it is the key element that is going to transform BlackRock and I would say every other financial services company. So technology is what is driving the scale at BlackRock and its driving hopefully better outcomes for and to our clients. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So Larry you spoke about building blocks to deliver outcomes and greater use of ETS to generate value. I guess just few thoughts here. One is how far do you see that trend going and I guess the second how do you think about the impact that this has on the value chain for the industry. In other words if this shift toward asset allocation continues and the move towards building blocks and assembling, how do you see the value shifting here and your ability to charge for manufacturing versus the ability to charge for distribution, your ability to charge for assembling and also the value of distribution here. Where is it most sensible and how do you think about evolving your positioning from here?","Robert Kapito","So it's Rob here. So fees are really just one aspect of the value proposition. And quite frankly after many years in the business I can't think of a better product to use for asset allocation than ETS. So one is it's going to be a toll where we are going to use it for precision type investments where you can action one specific area of the market in your portfolio, two is that you can actually make better judgments in the active equity space by using what we would call smart data ETS so that would be a bit of a derivative to it but focused on certain factors that you would want to have. Three is that, it's an obvious part of a multi-asset solution which is a growing area of the market where you would have just you need in order to get the returns that Larry is talking about in the low interest rate environment you need to focus on specific sectors of the market and ETS allow you to do that at the right value.","And the third thing which I really like is in the fixed income area where the exposure to just one particular fixed income bond is not going to give you the type of return. It's just too much risk for the cost of that. So by using an ETS in that \u2013 in the asset allocation model in your fixed income portion you also are diversifying your risk substantially at a much lower cost. Also the world is moving more towards portfolio construction capabilities. This is going to be in what we are calling models that we are going to be offering. They offer much higher levels of risk management and here is where we can utilize our technology as a differentiator because we can actually deliver a multi-asset solution which has the right risk requirements for that particular clients. And we are building technology around that so you have heard us mention Aladdin portfolio builder were we are giving financial advisers the ability to take a multi-asset portfolio and put it together using our products, using other people's products to come up with the ultimate solution. We are using it in a product that we call iRetire where we are trying to help get in the middle of solving probably the largest problem facing our country and other today which is the lack of savings for retirements, getting those \u2013 getting that cash and sitting on the sidelines working for people those people that are going to retire and being able to illustrate to financial advisers and their clients better capabilities to achieve those result and then also expanding into model portfolios to the financial advisers and to our clients to use to solve their problems. So we have the technology on the outside and then on the inside we have precision instruments through the ETS business that can help our clients achieve their financial objectives.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Good morning. I just want to maybe talk about the announcement of re-positioning of the equities business in the U.S. and it gets more specifically the changes you announced if I believe, mainly to the U.S. business you didn't \u2013 I don't think made same kind of changes outside the U.S. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why you didn't think some of that re-position was maybe necessary outside the U.S. how that business or market maybe differs or different somewhat you are experiencing here and then maybe compare the two?","Gary Shedlin","Hey Rob, it\u2019s Gary. I will just give a little bit of a quick overview and then Larry and Rob can jump in as they feel I mean I think ultimately we are looking at those efficiencies and development and maturity of markets and when we think here about the re-positioning it was \u2013 it really follows much more on the line of how we approached our product segmentation work with iShares a number of years ago at the end of the 2012. And in that case it was really trying to align who the particular buyers of a product were with the right fees and in this case it was really trying to align our ability to generate sustainable alpha in certain products with the fee potential and so if you think about segmenting the products between kind of core alpha and high conviction in some respect I think it's somewhat of an acknowledgment that in many parts of the U.S. large cap market in particular ability to really generate sustainable alpha and still charge premium fees in terms of very broad based portfolios that really tinker around indexes I don't want investors like index having per say but your ability to take risk and generate incremental return needs to be much more closely aligned with the fee potential and so it was reallocating in that we really try to align fee with the ability to generate a certain level of sustainable alpha. Outside of the U.S. market in lesser developed market less efficient markets more disperse and less correlation I think we still feel very strongly in places like Europe and Asia and certain emerging markets that frankly give ability to generate sustainable alpha can support higher fees and I think our performance has certainly show that overtime.","Laurence Fink","So let me jump in there. So this is not just a U.S. announcement that we made we are talking about our platform Rob and our platform is going forward believing that both human and technology is better than one or the other. So, in the platform that the portfolio managers are going to be using, going forward they are going to have the ability to tap in to both the data that we are getting from our technology, from our scientific activity equity groups and the fundamental groups because we believe that those people talking together using the data, using the signals that we are getting and the block and tackle fundamental approach together are better than either individually. So it is a platform change that we made it did have because of the reasons Gary cited more immediate attention on the U.S. but it's a platform change that we are making globally in our active investment business.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","Good morning guys. Just a quick question on kind of Aladdin and the technology business as more clients adapt the platform at what point does the platform become too big or there has been articles out there about potentially introducing systemic risk into the system if \u201ceverybody is on your platform\u201d that they are using the same technology that you guys are talking.","Laurence Fink","Well that's pretty complex question. So and I don't think there is a risk of it being too big. So let me try to deconstruct your question. Aladdin is more than just a risk management platform. It's an enterprise platform. So, there are many companies that provide enterprise platform for different companies whether it's Oracle or SAP or cloud computing so an enterprise system and that's what Aladdin really is because it's front middle and back office platform and a component of it is risk management. I think you are referring to the risk management component of it. It's a service model. We provide with different models each individual client can put their own algorithms on to Aladdin that are customized for them. So they can interpret the model. So it's not a platform that is monolithic with one model. And so the notion that the fact that many people use it that it becomes systemic is just not a point of understanding what the platform really is. I think by the client interest the opportunities we have the opportunities are as large as ever. And it is because of its enterprise solution and as we now have Aladdin provider working with the custodial banks ultimately it's going to simplify our trading, trade entry compliance working alongside with the custodial bank to create so much more efficiencies for the users across the Aladdin system. So if we could provide for Aladdin, for other clients this enterprise system that creates these efficiencies that make them in a better position we are all better off from it. So it's once again Aladdin is a service model it's not BlackRock's models. And so I think we are happy to give you a demo on Aladdin what it is and what it isn't.","Operator","Our final question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous.","Patrick Davitt","Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the active re-positioning and the charges taken there as well as the move of the custody asset, I am curious if all of these moves are really about helping pass those savings on to the client and absorb the fee cuts we are talking about or should we start to see some visible improvement to your operating results because of these moves?","Gary Shedlin","Well, Patrick it\u2019s Gary. I\u2019m hoping, you will see both I mean, as Rob said, part of the reposition, the active portfolio was basically changed to use scale to bring better outcomes to clients obviously in terms of better sustainable alpha at a more efficient price point for them. But the intent at the end of the day is to generate incremental growth for BlackRock shareholders by having a better value proposition in terms of price and performance that we think ultimately will drive better organic growth.","In terms of some of the things you mentioned around just leveraging service providers in many cases, in certain instances our clients pay those fees in which case that will be a direct benefit to them and in certain cases as if in our ETF which is a unitary price structure BlackRock itself pays those fees. So our shareholders will clearly benefit so I think that in all cases we\u2019re going to basically try to use our scale to drive growth that growth is ultimately better for both clients as well as shareholders and I think as you look at margin expansion over whether it\u2019s just the last year-over-year or 100 basis points or frankly even since we closed the BGI deal at the end of 2009 and margins are probably up 400 to 500 plus basis points since then. And I think there is no question that we\u2019re using our scale to generate better outcomes for both clients and shareholders.","If it\u2019s good for the client at the end of the day we strongly believe it\u2019s going to be good for the BlackRock shareholder.","Operator","Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks.","Laurence Fink","Yes, thank you for all joining us this morning and for your continued interest in our firm. Our first quarter results once again highlights the investments we made to enhance a differentiation at BlackRock\u2019s diverse global platform. We continue to take a long term view and stay ahead of, and navigating near term developments in the financial and economic landscape on behalf of our clients and importantly on behalf of our shareholders for that. Have a good quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference, you may now disconnect."],"3454":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference.","Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Chris Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, let's begin.","Gary Shedlin","Thank you, Chris. Good morning everyone. This is Gary Shedlin. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the third quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. And as usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.","Against a challenging market backdrop, BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results demonstrate the stability of our diverse global platform, highlighted by continued organic growth, stable operating margins and systematic capital return.","Third quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 2% higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was up 1%. Earnings per share of $5 were down 4% compared to a year ago reflecting lower non-operating results and a higher tax rate in the current quarter.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $6 million of net investment gains, largely driven by gains on private equity and real estate investments which offset market driven losses on certain hedge funds and unhedged or partially hedged Multi-Asset and fixed income seed investments.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.3% compared to 26.2% a year ago reflecting several favorable non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 and based on what we know today reflecting changes in our geographic business mix estimate that 31% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016.","BlackRock generated $35 billion of quarterly long term net flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across investments styles and client types, reinforcing the value of our broad based diversified business model. In a volatile market characterized by double digit quarterly declines in a number of global equity industries and significant FX movements, clients continued to look to BlackRock for strong risk management and long term investment solutions. In total, market depreciation and FX impact reduced the value of our assets under management by approximately $265 billion during the quarter.","Over the last 12 months BlackRock generated approximately $186 billion of long term net new business representing a 4% long term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher fee channels contributed a favorable overall change in our base fee mix.","Third quarter base fees were approximately flat year-over-year despite over $200 billion of negative FX impact to market depreciation over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 3% year-over-year.","Sequentially, base fees were down 3% due to lower quarterly average AUM, a seasonal decline in security\u2019s lending activity and the impact of divergent data on our fee rate as emerging and commodities market underperformed developed market.","Going forward, our fourth quarter entry base fee level will be impacted as we enter the quarter with lower spot AUM than our average AUM for the third quarter. Performance fees of $208 million were up 56% from a year ago and while broad based benefitted from a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance unlocked in the third quarter.","BlackRock Solutions revenue of $167 million was up 1% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Aladdin revenue which represented 81% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementation and has now more than doubled since 2009.","Strong connectivity between our BRS and institutional client teams is facilitating improved dialogue with our more sophisticated clients as we continue to see increased demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi risk solutions.","Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was down $11 million from a year ago though flat sequentially as revenue in the third quarter of 2014 reflected the impact of several large ECB AQR advisor assignments. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post financial crisis, FMA is benefitting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment.","Total expense rose $48 million year-over-year or 3%, driven primarily by compensation expense which increased $52 million from a year ago due to higher headcount, higher levels of performance fees and increased deferred compensation expense partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.","G&A expense decreased $7 million from a year ago due to lower levels of marketing spend offset by a lower benefit from the FX impact re-measuring dollar exposures held overseas to their respective functional currencies.","Recall that our GAAP G&A expense a year ago reflected an additional $50 million charge related to the reduction of an indemnification asset which has been excluded from our asset adjusted results.","Sequentially, G&A expense increased $7 million primarily due to higher levels of professional fees in the third quarter. Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% reflecting expense awareness in the current market environment. Looking forward, we continue to be mindful of our discretionary level of spend as markets evolve but currently anticipate the higher level of G&A spend during the fourth quarter driven by seasonal factors and transaction related expense associated with the recently consummated acquisitions.","As we stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long term value to our shareholders and will work to strike an appropriate balance between strategic investment needs and prudent discretionary expense management.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders in a consistent, systematic manner. In line with that commitment, we closed the acquisitions of Cuadrada the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico and Future Advisor, a leader in digital wealth management earlier this month. We do not expect these transactions to have a material impact on BlackRock\u2019s consolidated financial results.","During the third quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year. In the quarter while our clients faced significant market volatility, BlackRock generated $50 billion of total net flows, including $35 billion of long term net inflows reflecting the benefits of a diverse investment and distribution platform and a commitment to alpha generation.","BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $7 billion; positive across all asset classes representing 5% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic growth over the last 12 months.","International retail net flows of $5 billion were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income highlighting the global nature of our platform. BlackRock\u2019s U.S. retail business generated long term inflows of $2 billion demonstrating resilience from what was a challenging quarter for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock\u2019s flows were led by broad based fixed income activity or strong and consistent performance across the platform continues to differentiate us despite industry outflows in a number of product categories including unconstrained fees income and high yields.","Global iShares generated $23 billion of net new flows; representing 9% annualized organic growth for the quarter, and 12% organic growth over the last 12 months. iShares value proposition especially with respect to liquidity and transparency was extremely evident in a market characterized by heightened volatility and year-to-date flows remained in record territory.","iShares fixed income inflows of $18 billion reflected ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets. iShares equity inflows of $5 billion were led by flows into developed market exposures, including our Japan and Euro zone funds. We saw increased investor focus on risk aware smart data products with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $2 billion during the quarter and gaining the number one ranking within the domestic product category.","Our institutional client business saw over $5 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, driven by higher fee active offering as clients increasingly partnered with BlackRock to generate alpha across active solution and alternative mandates.","Institutional active net inflows of $6 billion reflected over $4 billion across fixed income strategies and nearly $2 billion into core alternatives and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of active institutional inflows.","Alternatives flows were broad based including infrastructure, private equity, real estate, fund-to-fund and alternative solutions offerings, in addition strong fund raising momentum continued with an addition of $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the third quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future inflows, to approximately $11 billion.","Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we\u2019ve made to build a differentiated global business model. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients irrespective of market environment or investment preference. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated growth overtime.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Thanks, Gary good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call.","Our third quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock\u2019s ability to manage risk and deliver holistic investment solutions as we look to achieve long term goals and navigate uncertainty and increasingly volatile economic environment.","A slowing economy in China persistence, weakness in commodity prices, uncertainty around the Fed\u2019s decision on rates and continued fluctuation in currency evaluations has contributed to significant declines in global markets.","Emerging market equities were down 19%, natural resources stocks were down 23% and European and U.S. indexes fell 9% and 7% respectively in just the last quarter. Government actions continue to influence markets as Central banks policies have caused imbalances in interest rates and currencies. Emerging market currencies have experienced significant volatility following nearly 9% in the third quarter before rallying over the past several days.","More than ever our clients value the model we built at BlackRock. BlackRock\u2019s global, multi product platform, our market leading risk management capabilities through Aladdin and our focus on long term solutions enables us to have a more robust conversation with more clients as they address portfolio composition and asset allocation.","These conversations are not just focused on what products BlackRock can sell, they are focused on outcomes our clients are looking for and how we could bring together capabilities across our global platform to help our clients achieve their goals. This approach has resulted in a stronger, longer lasting relationships with our clients than ever before which truly contributed to more than the $50 billion of net inflows this quarter.","Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage assets, but to help them to understand the longer term impact on developments in the financial landscape. The BlackRock investment institute continues to lead that discussion and hosted several client calls in the third quarter to address market volatility.","The BIIs [ph] most widely attended call reaching more than 4000 client participants. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth and BlackRock\u2019s $35 billion of long term net flows in the quarter, positive across as Gary suggested in investment styles and client types.","The fact that we are seeing such diverse inflows in a volatile market speaks to the power of our platform that we built overtime at BlackRock and the differentiated experience we provide to our clients. We continue to grow our global distribution footprint and a product set to serve a diverse set of clients with a holistic range of outcome oriented solutions as clients are looking for income and uncorrelated returns in the current investment environment.","In the U.S. we anticipate client demand for income focused products and since they were launched our strategic Income Opportunity and Multi-Asset Income funds have garnered more flows through the third quarter than any fund in these categories. With more than $35 billion of total inflows.","Building upon the strength to these funds in the U.S. our global versions of BlackRock unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset income funds are gaining momentum with clients internationally. Year-to-date FIGO our global unconstrained offering saw net inflows to $3.8 million, and our global multi-asset income funds, our net inflows were more than $1.4 billion.","On the institutional side, client demand for active fixed income and alternative strategies continues to drive positive organic base fee growth. For example, while official institutional clients have generally been environmentally driven net sellers and low fee index equity exposures, we have seen enhanced demand from the same clients for our active and alternative products and solutions, which have driven positive overall revenue growth among these clients this year.","And this is some focus that we've talked about over years, having client navigate from index into active and back in forth. And the biggest differentiating feature BlackRock today versus few years ago, we have both active and fixed and passive products.","BlackRock recognizes that even the most comprehensive and global set of solutions will be insufficient without strong investment performance. As a global firm our objective is to outperform consistently while our entire \u2013 throughout our entire investment platform.","We remain focus on embracing a team oriented approach leveraging our connectivity, our knowledge showing firms and translating all this information into insights from technology and big data to drive top tier performance across all assets categories and investment strategies.","We're seeing consistency in areas where we were strong and improvement in areas where we've been reinvesting in talent. And our scientific active equity business 97% of the AUM performed above benchmark, our peer medium for the three-year period and in our active taxable fixed income business 90% of assets performed above benchmark, or peer medium for three-year period.","Over the last few years we've invested in our fundamental equity business in hiring new talent in technology and in unifying this global equity platform to be more effective to tap the resources entirely through our BlackRock.","We're seeing the benefit of this investment and our fundamental active equity business 80% and 58% of our AUM is now above benchmark, our peer medium for the one year and three-year respectively.","And importantly our global platform continues to deliver results. BlackRock's European and BlackRock's Asian Fundamental Equities platform have 99% and 91% of their assets respectively above benchmarks or peer medium for the three-year period.","Investors continue to turn the iShares amidst heighten volatility to gain market exposures and enhanced portfolio construction. And iShares show as Gary discussed $23 billion in net total inflows.","iShares captured the number one market share of the net new business globally in the U.S. and in Europe and in the third quarter year-to-date. iShares flows were driven by fixed income as investors utilized fixed income ETF as an effective tool for diversification and liquidity.","Equity flows were driven by $5 billion into European listed iShares and we saw positive inflows in Canada and Asia Pacific as well. Extreme market volatility resulted in a disjointed market open on August 24.","Lack of pricing clarity, widespread delayed in stock openings and an unprecedented number of trading halts impacted a large number of both U.S. listed single name stocks and equity ETF.","We've spoken with many different market participants and based on our own experience and these conversations we have made several recommendation with respect to U.S. equity market structure in a viewpoint article titled \"U.S. Equity Market Structure Lessons from August 24th\", which we published on our website last week.","Demand of iShares has remained strong and net iShares flows following August 24th has been robust, at nearly $25 billion through yesterday. Despite near term market fluctuation we continue to focus on the long run by investing in areas that we believe will resolve in a more complete offering for our clients and delivering value for our shareholders.","Over the last two years our institutional clients rebalancing survey indicated that institutes plan to increase allocations to real assets. We continue to expand our real assets offering including BlackRock's infrastructure platform. We've provide clients with current income, diversification, income protection and potential for capital appreciation while helping to drive economic growth and job creation.","As Gary mentioned earlier this month, we closed on the acquisition I Cuadrada, Mexico's leading infrastructure firm and BlackRock now manages nearly $7 billion in infrastructure investments on behalf of clients worldwide.","Technology is another area where we built on our existing strength to recent investments to enhance a way we serve our clients. We continue to enhance our Aladdin platform by building out our multi-asset capabilities, driving 11% revenue growth year-over-year and we're seeing growing demand as investor become more focus on risk management in the evolving financial and regulatory landscape. Earlier this month we completed the acquisition of Future Advisor, a leading digital wealth management platform.","As consumers increasing engaged with technology to invest BlackRock and Future Advisor are positioned to empower our distribution partners to better serve their clients by combining Future Advisor's high quality technology enabled advise with BlackRock's multi-asset investment capabilities, our proprietary technology and most importantly our risk analytics.","We built and continue to invest in our platform and our people so that we can have a deeper dialogue with the clients and deliver consistent results for shareholders especially through times of heighten uncertainty.","On a very personal note, as many of you know, Charlie Hallac, who was named our Co-President last year passed away in September following a lengthy battle against cancer. Charlie has missed by many of his friends across BlackRock. Our greatest tribute to him will be the carry forward his life work by continuing to deliver excellence to our clients, to consistently innovate and more importantly to look relentlessly for ways to evolve as Charlie always did.","Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continue focus and dedication in creating better financial futures for our clients. So let's now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Hey, Robert. How are you?","Robert Lee","Great, thanks. Just maybe question starting with the iShares business. And clearly, flows there have been strong across a variety of products. One of the things it feels like you're seeing, or start to see like a surge of firms kind of crowding into, I guess, what I'll call the smart beta space. Just curious if you're seeing any impact from this in terms of price competition or kind of your thoughts about how that may or may not evolve, particularly as it relates to price competition?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Let me tell Rob Kapito to answer that.","Robert Kapito","So most recently we haven't seen the price structure that we had seen in asset. That has settled down. Certainly, [Indiscernible] in the market look to use price as one of the ways to enter the market, but I haven't seen that really in the last quarter. Going forward I think smart beta is one of the areas that going to continue to be a successful product than a necessary product. We currently have about $125 billion in client assets across a variety of factor based products and smart beta products.","We actually recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang and he is going to lead our factor-based strategies group so that we can lead in the factor-based investing on portfolio construction. And we're going to combine our skill set and his systematic investments skill set along with Aladdin to focus on the factor in the smart beta area. So, I think you are still seeing that something that clients are going to look for.","We already have a number of these, one as our minimum volatility fund. We've raised about $2 billion. And we are the leader in U.S. ETF in the smart beta area. But just to step back on the price, please keep in mind that prices are only one reason why people buy ETF. They are looking for precision or what you're discussing a new approach in smart beta or factored investing, they're certainly looking for liquidity, which means, you have to have a fund and have some sort of size depending upon the type investor they could get core investor which we call it buy and hold or they are looking to be more active. So, price is important but its only one aspect and I just haven't seen the price pressure that we've seen a year ago and up to the first half of this year.","Robert Lee","All right, great. And maybe the follow-up, just looking at the multi-asset class products, I mean that actually had a little bit of outflow, it wasn't too much, but little bit, but you mean that's a category that for years now has been pretty consistent solid inflows quarter after quarter. So I'm just curious was there anything unusual that quarter that may have driven that or anything we should be looking at net product line, product set?","Robert Kapito","I don't think there's anything unusual. The multi-asset product segment is a segment that clients have felt very comfortable on the long-term performance of that and they sometimes use those products as a cash alternative. And so when there are movements in and out of the markets risk on, risk off, they use that particular product. And in the last quarter we've seen a lot of risks off trades and that product has been used for that, but there's nothing out of the ordinary. We're seeing inflows now in that area, the performance is good, so it's really just an aberration over the core.","Laurence Douglas Fink","And I would say one of thing Robert, and specific in the third quarter we had one client move from multi-asset into an alpha product, so as Rob said, people are utilizing that but one client actually had greater conviction and went into a totally oriented market exposure alpha product.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Hi, Bill.","Bill Katz","Yes. Good morning everyone. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Obviously a very good flow story for the quarter, maybe to pick on one of the areas that was a bit weak, just to get your perspective on what might be going on underneath that. Could you talk a little bit about Asia-Pac? Is this just risk on, risk off for the market, and what do you think might reverse some of that recent attrition?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, there are some very large \u2013 without getting into client detail or any clients, there are some very large movements from some clients that are actively moving out of government securities into more risk oriented securities that's pretty well advertise without me going into the specifics of that. We have seen some clients because of cash needs have been selling products. So I think Asia-Pac has been dominated more by three or four large institutions moving around. I think I'm talking about the whole ecosystem of the markets.","And then, while we saw more consistent flows in Asia-Pac iShares. We are seeing actually more utilization of dollar assets today related to our institutional clients. And I would say, in some parts of Asia as Rob suggested in the fourth quarter there is more and more movements towards multi-asset. So, I don't see any major change in specific to BlackRock in the third quarter. We did have index outflows in APAC and however as I suggested in my formal speech some of these clients moved into more active products and so we had actually positive overall revenue growth in that region. So, I would say nothing that was extraordinary, just some large actions.","And I think you're going to see a consistent growth on Asia-Pac overall as some of the major clients are looking to investing more global products away from their host products or host country products, so we feel good about Asia Pacific and Australia right now.","Bill Katz","That's helpful. And then just a follow-up and this might be a little too early, but I'm sort of curious, there's been some recent rule changes promulgated by the SEC around mutual fund liquidity. Can you talk about how you see that playing out? Obviously, nothing is in written form quite yet in terms of where the industry has to go. But might some of the pros and cons of that regulatory change might be for the business?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So, obviously this is a proposed comment, proposed liquidity risk management role. And also they are focusing on stress testing funds. I think it's very important that we have better disclosure on liquidity for all funds. We have better disclosures on stressing funds. There are certainly more and more dialogue about one directional trades worldwide from the regulators. And so, I actually believe the SEC is leading this effort and trying to come up with the appropriate analysis to help guide investors, understand the embedded issues, risks or opportunities in mutual fund. So, we look at this as a net positive that and we are always in favor of better disclosure.","The one cautionary thing we would say to any regulator. Let's not make retail products less competitive than institutional products. So, for instance if they suggested that a mutual fund product should have a higher cash buffer and that would probably mean most institutional clients would move to a separate account, we may not achieve what we're trying to achieve. So, we are in favor of better disclosures. I think few better disclosures going to have better processes, possibly stress testing of fund depending on the methodologies that may work too.","So, we have an open mind and I don't know Bill exactly where it's going, but we want to play a constructive role globally on these issues, if I would say, as we talked about over the last few years regulators worldwide have gone from analysis of firms related to SIFI designation to activities. And we were a big supporter of that as a firm and these are the type of activities that most certainly the regulators is going to be focusing on and as I said we have constructive positive dialogue with the regulators throughout the world on this. So we'll wait and see.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Your next question is from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Robert Kapito","Hi, Ken.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. First on iShares, you highlighted about a year ago the opportunities for ETFs in Europe, given changing regulations. Today you highlighted European iShares as one of the reasons that equity iShares sales were so strong. So I guess, things kind of coming together with regulation in European ETFs, and is this really the beginning of the beginning for European ETFs?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm going to let Rob answer. Let me just start off in saying and then Rob will, because he has much more texture on it. Regulation has evolve in Europe, regulation in terms of the inability to pass on fees have led to obviously more opportunities with ETFs. And we are beginning to see that I would say, specific about European ETFs and the equities. We are seeing more interested investors in equity exposures in Europe, so I think that is a single -- that's a trend as a market exposure trend, but I think distribution trends are going to lead to much greater reliance by distribution platform utilizing ETFs.","We actually have also you saw Ken, that we had positive inflows in our mutual fund platform and we had consistent mutual fund flows in our EMEA operation. So I think the third point that I would make and then Rob will go into this specifics. I think our positioning in Europe is just getting stronger in both mutual funds and ETFs.","Robert Kapito","Okay. So I would just say there is two movements. One in Europe, certainly with the RDR rules, people are moving more towards advice and asset allocation. And when you look at that the best product to achieve that is iShares or EPFs. And so we're seeing continued demand because of those rules being so important. But we are also seeing the same thing in the U.S. where our clients are using iShares for asset allocation purposes and that bodes very well for EPFs going forward.","And the last trend is the products are trending to be more global products rather than just U.S. and just European. The global products are also seeing some demand. So some of it from changes and regulations, but a lot of it is due to education and people are having knowledge that iShares can actually play a big role in achieving the results that people want in their portfolios.","Ken Worthington","Great. Thank you. And then sovereign wealth funds have been in the media again. Maybe discuss how diversified BlackRock's exposure is between commodity-related sovereign wealth funds and maybe non-commodity related funds. And is exposure of BlackRock weighted to any particular size or asset class? I was thinking active versus passive and\/or fixed income versus equity. Thanks","Robert Kapito","Ken, that's a great question and it is a question I'm not going to answer because I don't talk about my clients. I just \u2013 it just something we have never made even any reference to any specific sovereign wealth funds or anything, so I'm going to leave it that.","Ken Worthington","Worth a try. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Robert Kapito","Hi, Craig, how are you?","Craig Siegenthaler","Good morning. So maybe first, you just hit on fixed income here. Very good results across all three of your fixed income bases and it looks like [Indiscernible] was a large driver for retail, but are there any underlying themes that really surprised you in fixed income in this quarter?","Robert Kapito","Well, I think the narrative about high rates and what does it mean for fixed income flows is just an entirely incorrect viewpoint. And this is one of the key elements of what I think is differentiating BlackRock. We're focusing on helping clients, meet the needs of their liabilities. Many clients have liabilities that are very long dated, many clients have under invested and so they actually have a gap between their during of their liability versus the duration of their funds.","As interest rates rise, if they rise, I think they will rise one day. We are actually going to see an accelerated movement towards clients buying longer duration assets. And that's I mean, I'm not talking about trading strategies, but clients that are pension fund oriented or long dated insurance type of products, they're going to use this as an opportunity to buy different long dated assets. Clients who are more interested in any trade obviously they're going to get out of the long duration and moving to the low duration or something like our strategic income opportunity fund where they are not going to be constrain to a duration, it will be unconstrained products.","So, what the third quarter saw? We saw lots of moment. We saw some clients were adding duration. We saw some clients were reducing duration. We saw some clients taking advantage and this is one thing that I haven't seen in the narrative. We saw, we have clients who are taking advantages of the rising high yield market because high yield underperformed in the third quarter and we saw clients are moving back into high yields, because the coupon and risk adjusted basis in the categories are achieving their needs to match their liability. So, this is an important component of why I believe we have differentiated ourselves because we are working with our clients, trying to keep the narrative on what is their outcome that they are seeking. It's not about trading in and out, it is about how can they best achieve and composition of assets to meet their liabilities. And by continuing to drive home this concept of long termism and outcomes instead of the noise of the moment has allowed us to have deeper dialogue and I think the flows and fixed income shown the results of having deeper dialogues and focus on outcomes.","Craig Siegenthaler","Got it. And then, I just have a follow-up here on multi-asset. Just given the softer results in 3Q in this one product set, could you give us an update on kind of the three main funds here, Global All, LifePath, and also Multi-Asset Income?","Robert Kapito","Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Absolutely correct. So, I think that there has been as Rob talked about and making Larry has on further on, we're seeing some movements in the multi-asset category. MAI and keep in mind also one other additional point is that when we talk about multi-asset that you're looking at in the context that our reporting we're really talking about the bundled outcome products that I think you're talking about. There's lots of other multi-asset discussion and solutions that are going on around the firm that frankly fit into lots of other categories.","But as you talk about bundled products like LifePath and Global All, which obviously two of our flagship products, they did see flattish flows in the quarter. And I think while we would say that MAI's flows were not as strong as prior quarters, it still was positive t the tune of 500 million and it\u2019s still remains a top selling or the top selling multi-asset income funds since launch about three years ago.","Larry talked about SIO and other similar products which is a fixed income products and obviously that and in addition to that with LDI and some other things we've seen very positive flows there. But there is no question that as we saw some slow inflows where there was MAI, DDG or even LifePath we did see some slows, some slowing of the flows. I think it's early for us to figure out whether in particular around target date that was an industry phenomenon or not, obviously we did see unprecedented volatility.","I think that if we actually look across a lot of those products with respect to different dates we definitely did see more flows in so called near term maturity dates as oppose to the long-term which may suggest that has people who are looking to basically approach retirement more quickly they saw volatility and we're deciding to eliminate some of the equity exposure in the near term, but I think we'll be watching that very closely and see to what extend those change direction in the next few quarters.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Gary.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity for ETFs being used as an alternative to futures contracts, and then also ETFs being used as a form of collateral? How do you see those opportunity sets progressing today and how much, would you say, of your book is in that capacity right now? And then just maybe if you could touch upon some of the longer term opportunity sets there? Thanks.","Robert Kapito","So, this is the beauty of ETFs that we constantly have been finding new uses for the products, so as futures becomes more expensive to use than ETFs had opened up a whole new world that we didn't even think about because of the collateral cost behind futures contracts. So, when we are going into the capital markets and we are meeting lots of fixed income and equity clients and having discussions and talking about to them about uses, most of the time we walk away with some other ideas that we didn't think about that they have needs for. So as you know now ETFs are being use as a surrogate for futures across many institutional accounts, so we think that's going to continue, how big that can be, just think about the size of the futures markets and certainly regulation is going to play a big role in that as well.","So, as capital costs are going up or lots of institutions, ETFs are starting to play a bigger role. So that's sort of where we're adding and I would tell you in the fixed income side, fixed income really let the equity market when it came to new uses and we have added a bunch of people in our capital markets group for iShares to go out, and to really work with different institutions in both education and also both learning what some of the needs are so that we could innovate those products for.","Michael Cyprys","Okay. Thanks. And then shifting to the institutional index side, could you talk about some of the opportunity sets they are converting some of the lower fee institutional index mandates to higher margin or higher fee oriented mandates, so basically increasing the share of wallet or moving upstream and shifting the share of wallet? How big of an opportunity set is that, and is there any low hanging fruit left? Any color around that would be helpful.","Robert Kapito","I think the opportunity remains to be quite large as we saw in our investment survey that the clients were looking to add more alternatives. And this is worldwide across the globe. We are \u2013 this is one of the big reasons why we are building our infrastructure platform, continue to build out our hedge fund platform, our real estate platform. So, as I said earlier, we are in deeper conversation with clients than we are ever been before. Much of it has to do with the quality of our relationships, our focus on risk management, and our ability to deliver solutions, I mean, that sounds like a lot of talk, but that positioning is now transformed us to have those dialogues five years ago when we in many relation where we strictly had a beta relationship we were not \u2013 we did not have ability to provide the products or have the dialogue with many more clients.","I believe today, we have more dialogue. We have deeper dialogues with clients worldwide that is going to allow us. If the opportunity prevails when a client is looking to reduced beta exposures to go into other forms of outlet exposures whether it is active equity management, active fixed income of alternatives, we have those dialogues and I \u2013 once again I do believe the third quarter is starting to show that evidence that we are able to navigate. Rob and I spend a great deal of time on the road. We have \u2013 we are constantly reminded that if we could provide the holistic solution to our clients, that we can provide a deeper analysis what the needs of our clients we have seen consistently that we are able then to have a broader product range solution for our clients.","And as we continue to drive that and build these relations, I think you are going to see that navigation and interflows in our business. If you look specifically in the third quarter, we grew many different types of alternatives, we had $2 billion in positive flows, we had another $1 billion in forward commitments and the most positive thing I could tell you related to those flows, those flows principally came in six different products, which is another statement of the growing product breadth that we are developing for our clients.","Michael Cyprys","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Hi, Alex how are you?","Alexander Blostein","Hi, Larry good morning. So sticking with the regulatory line of questions I guess you know we\u2019ve gone through a bunch of comments from the industry and the [Indiscernible] proposal it looks like we are getting a little bit closer to some sort of a final ruling and it looks like a lot of these you know a lot of things will kind of come through as they were written. So maybe hoping to get your perspective from one, what risk and opportunities does that create for BlackRock against the ruling, about the rules set today [ph] ","Laurence Douglas Fink","I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how the rules are going to be coming out. On the surface it will change the relationships with the distribution partners with their clients, we have to adapt our business with our distribution partners on that business. I think one thing is very clear how this outplays that it means greater emphasis on beta products and ETFs. But until we see how this has rolled out, and we\u2019ve had comments on it that are very public about our opinions related to the DOL. I would also say that if investors feel more confident because of however the DOL [ph] plays out that if investors feel more confident that they can invest fairly, securely we are all benefited by that. Now, I\u2019m not sure how that will play out, but we\u2019ve always believed that we could have a market place where our clients feel more secure that they have an opportunity to earn a fair return over a long cycle everyone will be benefited by that.","The Clients obviously our distribution partners and the investment management team. So we once again, we have tried to take a constructive approach to the SEC, mindful that some of the SEC Fiduciary rules would change the relationship with our distribution partners and we\u2019ve tried to work with the regulators in terms of finding a sensible solution that meets the challenges of our distribution partners, the asset manager that importantly giving the end client the trust that they need in terms of investing for the future.","Alexander Blostein","Okay, thanks for that. And then on the product side of things, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the active equity business. Nice to see flows turning positive here, I guess it\u2019s one of the better quarters we\u2019ve seen in a little while, so any granularity here in terms of where the strength has been coming from, whether its scientific I think you guys highlighted that in the press release or the fundamental equities where we are starting to see some turnaround?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So where we are starting to see the biggest turnaround is from the fundamental equity business. We spent a lot of time and money I should know in trying to rebuild our efforts there and the teams. And I feel very good about this, certainly in Europe our team there has been together longer. Their record across the board is now very strong and now we are starting to see the same efforts in the U.S. through our capital appreciation fund, our equity dividend fund. So the performance is actually really good. Now on top of that the scientific act of equity grew to more quantitatively driven and manual driven portfolios. The three here a record which had left a lot of the consultants look at the 98% of the assets are above the benchmark or appear immediate. We had work to do domestically and today the fundamental act of equity business 81% of the assets are above the benchmark for the one year period. So as time goes on, the performance is really, really much better. So when you see better performance it translates directly into flow and we are starting to see those flows or having much better dialogue with our consultants who are now putting us in the mix for proposals and we\u2019re also internally very focused on building out the equity effort and you are going to hear a lot more from us, from our marketing teams and the rest of the teams across the firm, because we are going to be much bigger in the active equity space and we are very happy to have the performance to back that up, so very important part and we\u2019re still adding people but we are getting results at the same time, good positive feedback from our clients.","Gary Shedlin","Let me just add one more thing. As I said in my prepared remarks the strength of our performance 98% are for Asian equities and European equities. We are seeing close and within those categories and we continue to be differentiated and I truly believe as the market settles down we believe the category where many investors will be seeking market exposures and that\u2019s going to be in Asian equities. And with our performance I would think over the next few years we are going to see accelerated flows there.","Laurence Douglas Fink","And just \u2013 just drill down as you have asked just a couple of notes for you, our equity dividends, our product was now in the 37 percentile. Our basic value has come from the 51st percentile to the 20th percentile and our large cap core has risen from 76 to the 29th percentile. Those are big loans and I believe those are sustainable, it\u2019s just the beginning of what we could do when we combine the knowledge and the communication across the platform.","Alexander Blostein","Got it. Thanks for all the color there. Appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Hey Brian.","Brian Bedell","Good morning, folks. Hi, good morning. Just to go back on the SEC liquidity rule proposals, I guess first of all I know it\u2019s very early, but as they are proposed do you think it\u2019s generally workable for investments in less liquid areas in high yields in small cap emerging markets.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Absolutely. That\u2019s right. I\u2019m sorry, go on\u2026","Brian Bedell","And then on the counter side of that how do you think Aladdin can play a role in this for fund companies if it owns?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So different products have different liquidity sets. This is one of the reasons why I think liquidity disclosure is a good thing. We have mentioned high yields. High yields have somewhat less liquidity than an investment grade product, a treasury fund has more liquidity than an investment grade corporate product.","You are paid a higher income for those types of returns and I do believe having a measurement hopefully a dynamic measurement, a dynamic measurement will allow investors and we are talking mostly retail investors having a better understanding and so if we can come up with a metrics that is dynamic, that is informative about of liquidity of anyone product and differentiating that liquidity amongst different funds, because some funds some mutual funds have systematically always even in the asset categories of let\u2019s say high yield have been consistently invested in the lower grade of high yield with less liquidity and some mutual funds have invested in the higher grade high yield that had more liquidity and so some form of dynamic measurement is probably good.","I don\u2019t \u2013 I actually believe once again as investors are becoming more informed and they better understand the risks and the returns I actually believe it will lead to greater investments in different asset categories. This is something we should all embrace.","So I don\u2019t \u2013 as I said I look at this as a positive. It\u2019s a constructive way of analyzing, we just need to make sure that we don\u2019t cause so much problems at all institutions run out of mutual funds and go to separate accounts and we may not be achieving everything that is necessary. But \u2013 we want smart investors, smart investors is better for the entire asset management industry. We should not run away from markets that are opaque, we should always be trying to find ways of making more transparency in terms of risk.","In terms of Aladdin, greater risk analytics, whether its liquidity analytics or stress test analytics is a very large positive for the future direction and needs of clients utilizing Aladdin. As I said in my prepared remarks, Aladdin is growing 11% a year. We are in deep dialogue with many clients right now and I feel very good about how Aladdin is the risk management platform of choice by so many investors worldwide.","Brian Bedell","Okay, great. Thanks and then just a follow up on the retail distribution strategy especially as it relates to ETF. Can you talk about the role of Future Advisor as you\u2019ve I guess the stages of planning that out and integrating with your RIA efforts and also your plans for sales force built to better penetrate your RIA segment?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So we \u2013 we are very excited about what Future Advisor will bring for us. We believe having better technology to interface with our distribution partners will give us a real opportunity. It is too early for me to really go into detail how we are navigating it, but in the early weeks we\u2019ve had a refreshingly large amount of interest with our distribution partners in the utilization of this technology.","Once again, through this technology if we could increase the knowledge base of products, increase the knowledge base of information through this technology we will have deeper and more robust conversations. If we can our hope is to and our intentions is to link our Future Advisor technology with our Aladdin technology to help our distribution partners to have both better risk analytics and better client interphase information so they could be providing better guidance to their clients. This is a long term investment for us, we are more excited about the investment today than we were as we thought about making the investment. And as I said earlier we are thrilled with the response by our distribution partners to have more engagement utilizing this technology.","So it\u2019s too early to really get into any details but our management team of Future Advisors are running around the country right now having many dialogues and conversations alongside our BlackRock solution team. So it is very important to note that we never really talked about it, putting Future Advisor into our BlackRock solution platform really gives us this ability to really create a third party platform to provide independence information for our clients that is very similar to what BlackRock Aladdin does for our clients independent risk management.","So we look at this as a great stepping stone for a deeper connection with our RIAs and our all our distribution platforms.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Once again, I thank all of you for joining this morning and your interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results once again highlighted the investments we made to enhance a differentiated platform, a more diverse platform, a global platform, a risk management platform. We continue to differentiate ourselves by taking a consistent long term view while staying ahead and navigating the near term developments in the financial markets. I think we help our clients by having this diverse multi product platform to help them navigate and I think the third quarter results speak loudly with those results. Have a good quarter and we\u2019ll talk to you in the New Year.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3348":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Regina and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew Mallow ","Thanks very much. Good morning everyone. I am Matt Mallow the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results, may and most likely will of course, differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today and additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. So with that, let\u2019s begin the call. Gary?","Gary Shedlin ","Thanks, Matt and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present results for the first quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","We are committed to generating strong organic growth demonstrating operating leverage and maintaining a consistent capital management policy as a framework for generating long-term shareholder value. ","Our first quarter results once again highlight the value of the investments we\u2019ve made to assemble the industry\u2019s broadest suite of active and index investment offerings and to deliver differentiated, customized investment solutions to our clients. ","BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 10% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 2% to $2.7 billion despite the negative FX impacts on our non-dollar denominated base fees and over $70 million of transaction-related revenue in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Operating income was $1.1 billion, 1% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $58 million of net investment gains including a one-time gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our 23.7% as adjusted tax rate for the first quarter benefited from $69 million of non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2015. ","BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results were driven by $70 billion of long-term net new flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 6.5%. Flows were positive across all asset classes, investment styles, client types and regions and organic revenue growth once again outpaced organic asset growth. ","Over the last 12 months, despite an increasingly volatile macro environment, BlackRock generated over $250 billion in total net new business representing a 5% long-term organic growth rate evidencing this fidelity of our highly diversified platform. ","First quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation, despite almost $220 billion of negative FX impacts associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year.","Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by a lower day count in the first quarter, entry rate headwinds and the continued impact of divergent beta and FX. Performance fees of $108 million were broad based, but nonetheless decreased $50 million from a year ago, due to the impact of a large fee associated with the liquidation of an opportunistic mortgage fund.","BlackRock Solutions revenue of $147 million was down 5% year-over-year due primarily to declines in FMA transaction-related revenue and 14% sequentially due primarily to the timing of completed advisory assignments. ","Our Aladdin business which represented 86% to the BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, but was flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2014, while sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues, as well as FX movements, we continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. ","The year-over-year revenue decline in our FMA business resulted from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during 2014. We continue to believe that our FMA business model is well positioned to benefit from partnering with sophisticated financial institutions and governmental entities to address the most complex balance sheet, risk and governance challenges in the ever changing political and regulatory climate.","Total expense rose $38 million year-over-year or 2% driven primarily by increased G&A, AUM-related and direct fund expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was roughly flat year-over-year as the combination of a stronger dollar and a global employee base offset and increase in headcount. ","As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation-to-revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes. G&A expense increased $26 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher marketing and promotional expense, and the impact of a one-time real estate-related benefit in last year\u2019s first quarter.","Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $48 million, primarily reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower foreign exchange remeasurement expense, and closed-end fund launch costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2014 consistent with last year, aggregate G&A expense in the first quarter benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, which will be incurred in the remainder of 2015. ","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first, reinvesting in our business, and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on March 6, we acquired certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, enhancing our credit platform to the addition of a middle-market private credit capability. ","We previously announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.18 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares during the first quarter. Based on what we know today, this increased level of quarterly share repurchases represents a reasonable run rate for the remainder of 2015. ","Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships and commitment to investment performance. First quarter long-term net inflows were nearly evenly split between our active and index franchises and were positive in each of our geographic regions.","BlackRock\u2019s global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $14 billion, representing at 11% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategy. ","Despite slower net flows in the US mutual fund industry during the quarter, the diversity of our franchise and strong performance in active fixed income positioned BlackRock to continue to enhance its market share position. US retail flows of $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of props including our top defile total return and high yield franchises and our flagship strategic income opportunities fund which was again the industry-leading unconstrained bond fund during the quarter.","International retail net inflows of $7 billion replaced by strong flows into our global unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset franchises. In addition, our leading European equities franchise benefited from a return to a risk-on environment and our top quartile Asian equity funds gathered more than $800 million in average inflows during the quarter.","Global iShares generated over $35 million of net new business in the first quarter representing 14% annualized organic growth. iShares retained the number one market share position of flows globally with strong flows in each of our product segments, core, precision exposures including our minimum volatility, factor and currency head suites and financial instruments where we saw ongoing momentum in replacing swaps and futures with ETFs. ","iShare\u2019s results were led by fixed income net inflows of $19 billion and we again captured the number one global market share of the industry\u2019s fixed income ETF flows. Equity flows of $17 billion were driven by flows into the core series and demand for international developed market and European exposures. ","iShare\u2019s flows were also diverse quite globally, with particularly strong growth in Europe where we are seeing broad based acceleration in ETF adoption across all segments and all asset classes. European iShare\u2019s flows of $15 billion in the quarter represented annualized organic growth of over 25%. ","Our institutional business generated approximately $21 billion in long-term net inflows for the quarter, the highest institutional flows we have seen since the BGI acquisition. Institutional index net inflows were led by strength in index equity, driven by defined contribution flows, offsetting outflows in our traditional defined benefit business. ","Institutional active net inflows of $18 billion reflected BlackRock\u2019s strong multi-asset capabilities and top performing fixed income platform. Multi-asset inflows reflected significant solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and strong demand for our dynamic diversified growth strategy and our LifePath target-date series. ","During the quarter, we also saw the funding of a $2 billion unconstrained fixed income separate account. While institutional active equity flows were flat for the quarter, we saw inflows of nearly $2 billion into our scientific active equity business, where 96% of assets are performing above benchmark over a five year period. ","Bar-belling continues to be a key strength as institutional clients pair cost effective beta exposure with alternative and other high conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns net of approximately $700 million of capital success in return to clients, institutional alternatives generated $1 billion of net new business, led by infrastructure and hedge fund solutions. ","In addition, we had another strong fund raise in quarter for liquid alternatives raising more than $2 billion in new commitments and now have over $10 billion in committed capital to deployed for clients. ","$800 million of net new flows from the recently announced ABR re-transaction funded in April and are not included in first quarter results. In connection with this funding, we will incur a product placement fee of approximately $5 million in the second quarter. ","In summary, in the quarter marked by continued volatility and divergent macro trends, our diversified business continue to deliver stable financial results. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry. ","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. Our strong performance over the last quarter\u2019s result of the significant investments we made in our firm over the last few years. The investments we made in our people, the investments we made in our process and importantly, the investments we made in our technology, all of which have been driven by our efforts to continually adapt to our changing market environments, the changing world environments, and to meet the needs of our clients.","BlackRock is focused on helping our clients navigate an increasingly difficult, unpredictable, and divergent financial and economic landscape. Investors today are faced with volatility in currencies and commodity markets; they are faced with sustained low and even negative interest rates and shifting long-term macro trends including longevity, and the significant impact on technology on jobs. ","Divergent economic conditions and Central Bank actions have sent currency markets into one of the most volatile periods on record affecting both developed economies such as Japan, and the Eurozone, as well as the emerging markets. The relative value of the US dollar and associated currency volatility is obviously having a rapid and material impact on large multinational companies. ","But it\u2019s also affecting smaller US companies and consumers, whereas a result of advancements in technology are increasingly buying and selling products in a virtual global economy. ","Historic low rates have been having a tremendous impact on how investors save for the future. The flow of funds in search of returns to meet future liabilities is growing larger everyday. This mix of growing assets of shirking supply of low rates is creating a dangerous imbalance and the increasingly desperate search for yields is now the greatest single source of prudential risk in the financial system. ","At the same time we are seeing a powerful changes in longevity and retirements and the investments in technology making the global economy and the way capital flows throw up flow through it and this is having a major impact in how we and our clients are living, how our clients work and how we invest.","At BlackRock we are constantly looking at the world and at ourselves to assess whether our platform, our services, our strategies can help our clients meet the challenges of evolving investment landscape. The need to anticipate changes and develop solutions is why we have deliberately equipped BlackRock\u2019s business model with such a wide range of capabilities, a capability of no other asset manager possesses. ","The issue impacting financial markets are beyond our ability to control, but what we can control at BlackRock is how we respond to these issues, how we build out our platform, how we execute our strategies we\u2019ve set forth for our business and how we deliver investment solutions to our clients.","BlackRock\u2019s first quarter results demonstrate the investments we made to differentiate our platform over time are driving value for our clients and most certainly are driving value for our shareholders. In the first quarter, BlackRock generated $70 billion of long-term net inflows representing a 6.5% quarterly annualized organic growth rate and a 5.5% organic growth rate over the last 12 months.","Similar to our fourth quarter in 2014, we had a diverse composition of flows, something that was very, very important for me as I think about our business. This composition flows is positive across our client base, positive across asset classes, regions and investment styles. ","Particularly, we are seeing a significant momentum in our active business where we experienced the highest total active flows we\u2019ve seen since 2007 at $32 billion representing a 9% organic - annualized organic growth rate in the first quarter. ","Roughly, two-thirds of the assets BlackRock manages are related to retirement. So core of what we do? And particularly we are focused on helping investors shift their focus away from the next day and towards an annual income and retirement. This is a difficult adjustment for many investors but a critical one for helping our clients achieve their goals.","They face significant challenges in a narrow zero rate environment, or by allocations of loans are insufficient to meet the liability burdens of pension funds, to meet the needs of insurers, and to meet the needs of our individual investors. ","The diversity and strength of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income business is helping investors in all types to navigate that environment and drove $36 billion of net inflows, across our global platforms. We continue to benefit from strong performance across our fixed income business, where 91% of our active taxable fixed income AUM is above benchmark or per medium for a three year period. ","SIO is in the 14th percentile. High yield bond is in the 10th percentile and total return is in the second percentile and the first percentile over one year. Clients also continue to adopt iShares\u2019 fixed income ETFs as an efficient asset allocation and exposure tool. And iShares remains the global leader in fixed income in the first quarter capturing the never won market share of flows of 53% with $19 billion of net inflows.","Today, investors are increasingly focused on outcome-oriented strategies that target specific goals while they are generating an income stream preserving capital, or growing assets within a certain risk profile and they are moving beyond the balance of traditional fixed income strategies into global, unconstrained or multi-asset strategies to achieve those objectives. ","BlackRock\u2019s multi-asset platform the combination of our investment management expertise, a robust portfolio of construction business and superior risk management, is all leveraging or unifying the Aladdin platform enabling us to provide investment strategies that will help our clients achieve the investment outcome inline with their needs and their objectives. ","To counter low yields, retail investors are leveraging our multi-asset income fund which has a wide net across asset classes to tap into income opportunities both within and beyond bonds and has a dynamic approach to balancing risk, return and income, while seeking to mitigate volatility. Institutional investors are similar trained to our dynamic diversified growth fund for diversification for stable returns and also manage volatility. ","Our ability to have deep and robust dialogue with our clients and to work closely with them and to provide some thought leaderships is what is allowing us to provide more tailored, customized strategies and this is a very important component of what is transforming BlackRock with our clients, the breadth of products as I said earlier, our risk management capabilities and you dovetail it altogether, we have a more and deeper dialogue with more clients than we\u2019ve ever had in our 27 year history.","We saw more than $9 billion of solution-based funding for insurance clients in the quarter as they continue to search for holistic solutions to navigate a low-yield environment, the transformational partnerships with the combination of a true One BlackRock effort and the resulting mandates span the best of our firm from active to passive to alternatives, all powered by risk management and Aladdin capabilities. These custom solution assignments leveraged our complete platform, they build deeper and more robust relationships with our clients and clients are finding out that no other firm in our industry has the capabilities to create this type of partnership and to replicate these types of capabilities. ","One key area where we are continuing to build out those capabilities even further is in infrastructure. Infrastructure investments help our clients access an alternative asset class that provides inflation protection diversification, and the potential of our capital appreciation and importantly for so many of our clients a long duration returns. ","A key aspect of our work has been to promote improved public private partnerships which jointly increase opportunities for investors and to help governments access much needed sources of capital to drive economic growth to create countries to have a better economic future to improve the quality and life of countries and to create job creation. This is a perfect marriage of building a base of clients and their capital with the needs of countries and building a better economic future and this is one of the strong reasons why we are emphasizing infrastructure over the next coming years as a major component of our positioning at BlackRock, our positioning with the client, and our positioning with various countries of the world. ","In March we teamed with PEMEX, Mexico\u2019s national oil company to finance two natural pipelines, gas pipelines, critical to Mexico\u2019s continued economic growth. The partnership builds upon the well established track record of our existing infrastructure business and by extending our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, will offer BlackRock\u2019s local and international clients access to a previously untapped investment opportunity. ","Another area where we continue to invest is technology, which is always been central to our business model. Our Aladdin platform which we transformed from an internal risk and investment management system to a revenue generating business providing a unique competitive advantage for BlackRock. ","Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year and increasing value as third parties operating platforms position BlackRock to consistently invest a growing stream of revenues into improving our technology, into expanding our technological offerings, to powering a constant upgrade cycle for the Aladdin community and driving a network effect benefits for our clients and for our shareholders. ","Technology has not only shaped the way BlackRock serves clients through Aladdin and how we view risk management, it also drives the way we build investment solutions. Technology and data science are enabling BlackRock to bind our fundamental investment expertise with the best of our scientific and index investing to create innovative investment strategies. And we are investing in people with exceptional strong backgrounds in data technology to drive this effort. ","Another area where we have been building out our capabilities is to meet the growing demand from investment offerings that have a measurable positive social impact; I would infrastructure as one of those capabilities. In the first quarter, we announced the launch of our new BlackRock impact platform which will truly unify the firm\u2019s approach to impact investing where we currently manage more than $225 billion in assets. ","As a fiduciary, BlackRock thinks seriously our responsibilities not only to provide the investment performance and the solutions our clients need, but we also are taking a leadership role in advocating for the best \u2013 for our clients\u2019 best interest and those of the broader market and economy when it comes to long-term investment by the companies we invest on behalf of our clients.","These efforts are led by our corporate governance team which engages extensively with thousands of companies in order to help foster the best long-term outcomes for those companies and by doing so increasing value for our clients. Our corporate governance team has a gold standard for the industry and is another key differentiating factor for BlackRock and our responsibilities with all our clients.","As part of our engagement effort, earlier this week I sent a letter to CEOs globally including those of every company in the S&P 500 urging them to engage on key governance matters then in our experience supports long-term and sustainable financial performance. ","We recognize that some of the market dynamics that I described earlier present an overwhelming challenge for companies working to reset short-term pressures, but companies can help diminish these pressures and improve their own positioning by developing and articulating a clear convincing and creating a long-term strategy and long-term value. ","These efforts will help them attract long-term stakeholders and lay the foundations for a stronger, a more sustainable, and more stable economic growth for our country and other countries around the world. ","Once again in the first quarter we initiated some truly innovative and unique mandates that will drive our long-term value for our clients and our investors. Our PEMEX partnership is the first of its kind since Mexico passed its historical energy reform since 2013. We announced several highly customized solution mandates to help our global insurance clients navigate a historical challenging interest rate environment. ","We partnered with Ace to launch a new vehicle that pairs the strength of their insurance businesses with our ability to provide best-in-class investment returns. And in Asia, we are expanding our relationships with some of the world\u2019s largest asset owners in new ways, in one big case using Aladdin to better understand risk and enhancing the quality of returns and clients portfolio and a second case, employing our transition management team to both implement a lion mark asset allocation changes that a client is undertaking in an effort to stimulate their nation\u2019s economy.","Individually and collectively, these mandates demonstrate the BlackRock creativity, BlackRock\u2019s innovation, and the breadth that BlackRock provide for solution-oriented offerings. And more importantly, through that process, this creates and fosters deeper and more meaningful relationship with our clients which will then allow us to have and working with them a larger share of their wallet.","It is the strengthening of these relationships, our relentless focus on improving the firm that will drive our future growth, and will drive and create long-term value for our shareholders. ","Once again I want to thank our employees for the continued unwavering dedication in creating a better financial future for our clients. I want to thank the employees for being excellent students of the financial market to be prepared to answer questions for all our clients and with that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Laurence Fink","Hi Glenn","Glenn Schorr","Hi, thanks very much. I guess, I\u2019ll focus on the retail side of the house. You continue to make progress, you made a lot of investments, it\u2019s paying dividends, $14 billion in this quarter, $11 billion last quarter and you\u2019ve changed some of the way that you comp your people there. So, I consider BlackRock a big winner and some of the fiduciary changes, the Department of Labor is suggesting, but I am just curious how you think about it on both the iShares side of the house but also the traditional retail distribution, because it impacts you guys in a lot of ways. ","Laurence Fink","The DOL proposal?","Glenn Schorr","Correct, correct. ","Laurence Fink","First of all, there is a 75 day common period and we have to recognize this is just a proposal and it may evolve and change. I said all along, we are a huge supporter of regulatory efforts in the protection of clients\u2019 interest. I think as you just suggested, if clients feel more secure in their investments, and they believe that their investments will indeed produce the outcomes that they are looking for, no firm is a better winner on having more participation in financial markets than BlackRock. So, on a macro basis, we are a huge supporter of making the investment world somewhat better for the investors, so the investors feel that they have a equal opportunity to win over the long run. As proposed, there is certainly going to be changes in how people navigate their interest. As you suggested, we are \u2013 in some categories, some people have said this is going to benefit indexing more than active. We are not 100% certain there, but obviously, we will be a big beneficiary of this. We have benefited and are proven in retail and iShares has to do with as you said, we have built a bigger and a more robust team working with our client base. We combined our retail and iShare sales force to provide what we call a client-centric approach. We are agnostic about beta products versus alpha products. We are trying to help and achieve outcomes and I don\u2019t think we are harmed in anyway related to whatever that\u2019s proposed in the DOL, but this \u2013 what DOL is doing is actually playing into our approach of how we are trying to navigate beta products and alpha products, mutual fund products with index and ETF products. So, we are well positioned for that, but I do believe we are well positioned because how we organize ourselves for related to client-centric approach. ","Glenn Schorr","Fair enough. I guess, the only follow-up I had is, is at the highest level, couldn\u2019t agree with you more, $70 billion of flows, very broad based. It underscores all the points you made. At the end of the day, when I look at it and I see flat operating leverage and flat margins albeit at very high levels, it just took me back a drop and I just don\u2019t know if they are just a bunch of moving parts with some of the year-on-year stuff and the FX impacts. So, wonder if you could\u2026 ","Laurence Fink","I am going to let Gary talk about it. I think Gary could give you a little more color on the FX. ","Glenn Schorr","I appreciate. Thanks.","Gary Shedlin","Well, I think your question is specific to the operating leverage and margin point. So, I would say the following, Glenn. I think first of all, let\u2019s break it down. If we look at the revenue side, obviously, the revenue was impacted as we said by about $70 million and in the year ago quarter that we would deem more opportunistic. So obviously, that\u2019s a big chunk of that came from the performance fee and then we had some significant transaction-related revenue in our FMA business. Obviously, then we got the FX impact and we noted that on a constant currency basis, we think that base fees alone would have been probably up closer to 8% year-over-year. Then we look at the expense side, and I think on the expense side, we are obviously benefiting to a certain extent from significant non-dollar expense that we have. We have about 5800 employees that sit outside of the Americas that represents close to \u2013 I think 47% or 48% of our total employee base. But obviously, notwithstanding that, there is still margin associated with our non-dollar sources of profitability. So, I think, what I would suggest to you, I hate these start to get into a so-called normalization, because who knows what the definition of normalization is and that\u2019s a difficult concept. But I would say that on a more recurring basis, if we thought about our \u2013 both our revenues and expenses, there is obviously been some timing differences that we also noted on the expense side versus last year in terms of the real estate credit and taking into account FX more broadly, we look at our own business on a more normalized basis and we\u2019d suggest that we see positive year-over-year margin improvement and operating leverage. ","Glenn Schorr","Okay. I appreciate that guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Will Katz with Citi. Please go ahead. ","William Katz ","Laurence Fink","Hi, Bill.","William Katz ","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks so much for the update. First question I have is maybe we stand the expense side for a second, Gary, you mentioned you expect to see a bit of a seasonal pick up in G&A as you go forward. Just sort of wondering, where the growth might be and how we might be able to frame it out in absolute dollars?","Gary Shedlin","I\u2019m sorry, Bill, you are talking about expense more broadly, or?","William Katz ","Well, I think, you mentioned G&A was seasonally low, timing was little bit delayed for some of the initiatives. So I was curious of what \u2013 where you focus on in terms of the initiatives and then absolute dollar size, what kind of rate of increase are we talking about? ","Gary Shedlin","Yes, I mean, we obviously, try not to give a whole lot of guidance on that. But I do think that we tend to see a little bit of a lower ramp up in our G&A spend at the beginning of any part of the year. And I think as we mentioned on a sequential basis, versus the fourth quarter, we obviously had \u2013 we basically benefited from the fact that we didn\u2019t have a closed-in funds launch in this quarter that we did mentioned that we\u2019ll be having about $5 million of product placement fees associated with AVR RE. There is obviously some FX re-measurement stuff that also goes on that creates some noise quarter \u2013 quarter-to-quarter. But I think generally speaking, we haven\u2019t really changed our estimate for run rate G&A over the course of the year. It just means that a lot of it\u2019s going to be pushed into the latter part of the year as it was last year. ","William Katz ","Okay, and as a follow-up question, I may have Larry or yourself, scientific turned around a little bit this quarter, you have great performance. How much of that is market share gain versus sort of a step-up of demand and the broader question is, you mentioned both passive and alternatives or high concentration alpha, where is the market in terms of more generic long only relative value you mandate these days? ","Gary Shedlin","Well, we are seeing increased flows as you suggested in our scientific equity offerings. We are seeing more \u2013 we have more dialogue on our model-based, factor-based products and we have had now in five years. I was frustrated as you know in other calls over the years that we have not seen as much flows in that area. I think as some fundamental products have underperformed and people are starting to recognize that 96% of our SAE products are above our peer medium over five years. And I think there is more interest today than we\u2019ve seen in over five years for some type of model-based, factor-based investment strategies. You are seeing more and more in the mutual fund, even in some cases, ETFs more smart beta type of products. And I believe this is going to finally begin a period of substantial momentum in these areas. And so I do believe you are going to see shifts in that area as an industry more towards smart beta factor-based investing. And I am not suggesting fundamental is going away, it\u2019s not. And so, but I believe we are positioned at BlackRock to benefit from that re-looking at the scientific or model-based equity. We intend to be announcing some very substantial hires in this area. I talked about data management. We believe other sources of information like big dad is going to be an important component to how one looks at investing and so we are investing in these areas to \u2013 for the fundamental and our scientific side. And this is probably one of \u2013 this is going to be one of our more exciting offerings in the coming years and this is an area that I believe is going to finally start to seeing accelerated growth. So, it\u2019s not a matter of share, Bill, as you ask, it\u2019s a function of the world is re-focusing on these products. Both on the retail side and the institutional side. ","William Katz ","Okay, it\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. ","Laurence Fink","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler ","Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. With many large prime money market funds converting to government funds now, and now the LCR also requiring banks to hold more short-term government paper. How do you think the demand supply dynamic will impact T-bill yields and accordingly the yields for government money market funds here?","Laurence Fink","I will let Rob talk about that.","Robert Kapito","So, obviously, [Indiscernible] changes and where rates are going to go over the next year are going to have a pretty big impact than where we are going to see flows in the money market arena. So right now, we are seeing more flows internationally than domestic. We are seeing more clients than in government and if rates change that will reverse. So we are taking an approach where we have gone out to our clients and talking about the future regulation and preparing products for them that will make sense depending upon where rates are. So, some of those things sort be for example. We are going to be going with constant net asset value, government money market funds and those will be without redemption gates or liquidity fees. We have the floating net asset value of institutional prime money market funds and we plan to maintain our largest prime fund which we have about $66.5 billion and that\u2019s the temp fund and that will be our private institutional fund. And then we have others that were preparing a floating rate short maturity institutional prime money market fund and a constant NAV government money market fund and short maturity national and state-specific muni funds. We are also prepared to do separate accounts. So, it really is going to depend upon where the regulation ends. Of course, you know that the implementation date of all of these new products are around October of 2016. So, I think working together with our clients to make sure that we are prepared, no matter where rates go is important for us and year-over-year, we have about $39 billion that\u2019s been added into the cash fund. That\u2019s about a 15% year-over-year growth. So there is still a lot of demand for money market type products and it will just change some of the nuances to be able to apply with the regulatory issues. But this is a big business for us and we also see some of the smaller money market groups approaching us as well because scale and size is also going to be very important to be able to satisfy our clients\u2019 needs. ","Craig Siegenthaler ","Thanks, Rob. Just as my follow-up here. I was wondering if you guys can provide some background of flow trends between the retail focus core series and also your higher fee generating equity EPS and you know what while it\u2019s positive to see growth, it seems like there maybe a little bit of a mix shift undergoing in the equity business. So maybe you can just provide some color here.","Robert Kapito","So, certainly there is a big change in mix depending upon performance and also depending upon what areas clients are focused on. So there is two-parts to that question. One is, people looking on an institutional basis for precision exposures in particular areas like emerging markets which would have a higher fee versus, buy and hold segments that are looking to supplement what they own with ETFs and what they call a core series. Now, there is a difference in fee between the precision instruments like in emerging markets and the core series which is more of a buy and hold segment. So, quite frankly, we are seeing growth in both of those right now. But, this is an area that is starting to gain attention. It\u2019s starting to mature and what we are trying to do is develop a core set of products that is going to be for the buy and hold segment. We continue to round that out. We had over $12 billion that\u2019s going into that core segment. In the quarter, we\u2019ve had about a 25% organic growth in this global core segment versus just a 14% overall market share in the iShares business. But the point here is that, there is a somewhat of a fee shift, but it\u2019s not that dramatic and it\u2019s not the overriding factor in people buying these iShares. Its segmentation is spilling out their portfolios and what they want and then of course you have to be competitive in what they are buying. But we don\u2019t see an overall dramatic change in the pricing and this removing from high fee to lower fee, particularly where you need.","Laurence Fink","Craig, I would also add, in terms of the fees and fee mix, as I emphasize, we saw strong flows in fixed income and so some of that you are just saying, the fee mix change because of great flows into fixed income ETFs. So, as Rob discussed, it\u2019s not necessarily moving from one product in equity to another. So, I would tell you there is a constant amount of pressure to making sure we are competitive related to fees. We are going to continue to have that pressure and we want to be a leader in that. And so, we are very comfortable with the mix of business and how business is evolving. But more, we are winning new clients that we did not have or more buy and hold where this was not where BlackRock had great market share and as we penetrate more and more of the independent advisors that historically was more the landscape of a vanguard, where we are starting to see increased flows in our core series. So it\u2019s not that we are seeing a substitution with some of our clients, we are penetrating more in different clients. As Rob said, we are penetrating more buy and hold clients too. So, we look at this as our broadening of our platform not necessarily an outright fee mix change. ","Craig Siegenthaler ","Thanks, Larry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead. ","Laurence Fink","Hi, Robert.","Robert Lee ","Hi, thanks. Hey guys. Good morning. I have a question really on the \u2013 I wanted to on the DC business. I guess, first question is, you certainly have had very strong fixed income flows, but just curious in your perspective have you seen the replacement activity in the 401(k) market that has been talked about for a while. I think you guys expected and kind of maybe how do you feel like if that\u2019s happening if you are kind of getting your fair share of that activity? ","Laurence Fink","We grew, in the first quarter, defined contribution business by $20 billion, so, I am not sure if that\u2019s a fair share. I believe it is, I think we had a very good quarter of defined contribution. We are investing quite a bit which then represents about 14% organic growth. So, we are well positioned in it. We are increasingly working on more trends that are impacting in a favorable way for us. So, keep in mind, what are the trends in DC. There is a greater trend towards open architecture, really good for us in BlackRock. I mean, historically, we were harmed by close architecture, more open architecture allows us to provide our products. Two, in DC, there is a greater demand for indexation that obviously plays into our strength. Three, as a innovator in target date, we are benefiting from that. So, do you add those three combinations plus, we have witnessed in lot of the $20 billion of flows because our strong active fixed income performance we are seeing accelerated flows in those DC plans that are consistent and staying with the active strategies. So, across the board, I would tell you, we have \u2013 probably, as large of opportunities in DC than we\u2019ve had in years, and years, and years and much of it has to do as I discussed earlier, our positioning, our strength in performance in fixed income, our strength in designing target date products and moving towards indexation, and much of it has to do with, DC market not growing as a whole. In fact, there is a belief that DC can slowly start decreasing as the men and women are getting closer to retirement are spending what they accrued. But I believe BlackRock has a great opportunity in front of us to gain market share and we are very well positioned in product and we are well positioned to take advantage of this because our positioning in the index and in active fixed income. ","Robert Lee ","Okay, great. Thanks. And then, maybe just one follow-up on the ETF business, I mean, obviously, business is going gangbusters in the US, outside the US and I am just curious, I mean, you guys have come up with different ETF product structures and I am thinking of particularly of kind of some of the term date fixed income strategies you\u2019ve come up with, developed. And it doesn\u2019t feel like those particularly have taken off. I am just kind of curious to know your thoughts on that, just it would seem to be a kind of ideal structure for these low rate environment if investors are nervous about higher rates to kind of turn things out. But, just, kind of your thoughts on why maybe that hasn\u2019t taken hold as much as you would have \u2013 maybe should have \u2013 would have expected? ","Robert Kapito","So, your guess is as good as ours. We try to have different products in the pipeline to satisfy what we think our clients should be looking at. But there is a whole product process here of awareness going on a socking to clients that will take them a while to understand what the product is, they like to see its performance a bit before they invest in it. So, I can\u2019t tell you exactly why we think that it makes sense as you do. But we like to have different products in the pipeline and actually we have pretty high aspirations for these. One of the ones that I am a little disappointed in is, is the iBonds that we have, because it really fits a client\u2019s portfolio so much better than buying individual bonds and taking to risk of the bid offer spread and having more liquidity and pricing diversification and look through treatment. So, I am a little disappointed, but, if I axe on that and not propose the fund, I can tell you took about ten years to get our emerging markets fund off the ground and see real money come into it. So we are just going to go out there, if we think it\u2019s a good product, talk to our clients, make sure we have the awareness, show them the positives of it. Be able to evaluate the performance and then I hope that it catches on. This is very different than some others and you tell me what they caught on. We have our mid ball strategy, the currency hedge. It also is a matter of when you produce the product and what\u2019s happening in the market at that particular time. So, I think for us, our growth strategy is to continue that, come out with innovative ideas. Have a pipeline of these. Make sure we are in the markets and then over time depending upon those environments, the factors and awareness that will ground. ","Robert Lee ","Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Laurence Fink","Hi, Ken.","Ken Worthington ","Hi good morning. Just one question on the regulatory front for me, really looking at FSOC and SIFIs, so, how is the conversation evolving with regulators on systemic risk today? I guess, to what extent is the conversation still moving for of the corporate risk to the product risk? And then how effectively do you think the asset management industry is at kind of regulator education and is it really effectively making its case?","Laurence Fink","I think the dialogue at the FSOC in the United States is principally activity-based. In Europe, it was going towards activity-based, it has migrated a little bit to more corporate-based and activity-based. It is in a common period that we are sending comments to the FSB related to that. I think there is going to be a long dialogue. There was a meeting earlier this week at the \u2013 I think that\u2019s our reports related to it, related to the FSB meetings in New York with large investment management companies. I would say from BlackRock\u2019s perspective, a year ago, year-and-a-half ago, it\u2019s was pretty lonely for us that we were one of the few firms having those meetings and educating regulators related to the risk associated with asset managers. We always note importantly that the asset management industry represents less than 20% of the capital markets. Asset owners are principally the largest players. They manage their own money and they play a significant role too. So if you want to effect the ecosystem and making sure the ecosystem is safe and protected for society and for investors as we said publicly and we continue to try to educate it has to be activity-based. And today now, because of the efforts of the FSB, tens of asset mangers are now working alongside us. Industry groups are working alongside with us. So I am actually pretty thrilled that there is more companies, more people hoping spending time educating. I don\u2019t know what the solution or the outcome will be, but we look at this as a long-based process. We want to be constructive that it\u2019s our number one responsibility in making sure that in the end, it leads to a better sounder financial system. If we have that as I talked about other issues related to long-term, I think BlackRock is a biggest beneficiary of more participation by more people because they believe it\u2019s a safer environment to invest will be all, I am all in favor of it. However, there are difference of opinions and we are trying to push our opinions. It\u2019s going to be a long process. It\u2019s going to be very public about how the process plays out. I don\u2019t feel any \u2013 I actually believe the process is more robust now with more conversation that we\u2019ve had in a long time and we\u2019ll see how this all plays our, Ken. I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t give you any degree of where this is moving internationally. I would be kind of odd as the FSOC is moving towards outcome activities that therefore becomes in a different way, I would then question is this a Europe versus US phenomenon. It\u2019s interesting to know what Europe is doing with Google and other issues in technology, attacking US technology companies. So, I am \u2013 we are participating this. We are going to be good corporate citizens and we are trying to do our best in education. ","Ken Worthington ","Great, that was very helpful. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our final question will come from the line will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Mike.","Michael Carrier ","Thanks guys. Hi. Hey, Gary, maybe just a follow-up on the margins and I understand a year ago like the elevated BRS and performance fees, if I just take the second quarter going forward and thinking about the year-over-year trends, organic growth coming in above 5%, markets up, and obviously got the FX hurdle. As we start to looking at second quarter, third quarter going forward, assuming these trends are similar. Should we still see that year-over-year ability to generate operating leverage or is there something changing on the expense front? And I know there is a lot of moving parts, but just wanted to get a sense relative to the first quarter year-over-year trend.","Gary Shedlin","Michael, I am going to go back to something Larry said in his comments. It\u2019s about what we can control and what we can\u2019t control. So, I think we feel incredibly comfortable with our ability to grow organically and we feel incredibly comfortable with the ability to manage our expenses as we have over the last four plus years and as you know notwithstanding reinvesting over $1 billion back into the business through the P&L, we have expanded the margin over 350 basis points during that time. But there is certain things we can\u2019t control, I mean, which obviously is beta and FX and notwithstanding all of those things, which clearly is impacting our fee rates year-over-year. We still think if we have kind of stable markets, we are very much committed to the original margin guidance we\u2019ve ever \u2013 we\u2019ve always given people which is that we think that our business has obviously benefits from scale in a bunch of areas and we see no reason that we won\u2019t be able to continue to evidence margin improvement that we have over the last three plus years. ","Michael Carrier ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just quick follow-up, this is two quarters, I think in a row that you guys have commented above like a 6% organic growth rate. And Larry, I think, when you talk about all the trends and the products that you offer, what you guys are doing on the distribution front. It makes sense that new clients are gravitating towards lot of the offerings. I think when you guys look at investments being made currently for the outlook, do you \u2013 like what ending do you feel like you are in, in terms of still being able to either launch new products or gain additional share in certain distribution channels to be able to be in this, whether it\u2019s a 5% organic growth rate, but obviously it\u2019s been higher than what we\u2019ve been used to? ","Laurence Fink","Sure. So, I think we are now starting to witness the impact of having better performance in our active products, especially fixed income. Two, our expansion in the RIA channels and the buy and hold channel is now being exhibited in their mutual funds. It\u2019s been exhibited in our core series ETF products and I can underscore and that\u2019s how we are building on and expanding our global platform and I am using infrastructure also as a mechanism to get stronger within these areas, countries, side-by-side building our brand in those countries, building our opportunities in those countries. Obviously, that\u2019s a long-term strategy, Michael, that\u2019s not something that we are going to witness and see significant changes. That\u2019s a good example of a five, seven year investment where we see on behalf of our clients, but it also has a very significant impact on our positioning in the various countries as a leader in the investment business. So, you think about those investments. We are \u2013 I think we are going to continue to build market share in retail. We witness that for four straight years. Two, I think it\u2019s fair to say that ETFs are in a secular growth period that is not over yet. We are the biggest beneficiary of that secular growth and then three, which I said for many years, if we can begin to build a stronger relationship institutionally with more clients and building not a product-based relationship, but cross-selling of end solutions, we are going to start benefiting on the institutional side. So, you add those together, it does allow us to have above industry and I want to underscore above industry organic growth trends. And then if you add the amount of investments we are making not just in alternate \u2013 not just in infrastructure, but across the board in alternatives, where it\u2019s not really shown up in the organic growth area because, as I said, we won $10 billion commitment. We don\u2019t \u2013 unlike lot of the private equity firms, we don\u2019t show that in our AUM, but we identify the unfunded commitments. That\u2019s another good example of the power and the growth of the opportunity. So you tie this together, cross-selling products with institutions with better performance by providing solutions, by having even more market share opportunities in our Aladdin business, our iShare secular growth and our positioning in retail worldwide, plus better positioning, country-by-country, I think we are in a very good position to be leading above industry trend market share. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen\u2026","Laurence Fink","And market growth \u2013 let me, I am sorry, operator.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks? ","Laurence Fink","Well, I think it\u2019s just that some of that \u2013 first of all, thank you for taking your time. I know there are lot of other people, institutions that you are going to run to because of all the first quarter results today. Let me just reiterate, we believe that our first quarter results really highlights the diversity of our product platform, the global nature of our platform that truly differentiates us versus from every player in the world. As I said, just earlier, we are seeing that impact of those investments. We are seeing a continued positioning. I truly believe as a firm, if we continue to talk about long-term issues, try to be helpful in the narrative in the world of investing a more balanced long-term approach and if we continue to execute those strategies on behalf of our clients and our clients\u2019 needs, we will be positioned quite well for our clients worldwide, our institutional clients, our retail clients. And I would just underscore these are very exciting times for BlackRock and all the citizens of BlackRock. And so I feel very good about where we are, where we are going and the opportunities in front of us. With that, I would like to just thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in our organization. Have a good quarter.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Mallow. Before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks, as I do with each of these calls, let me point out to you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that our actual results may differ from these statements. As you all know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors which may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what's said today. Finally BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I'll get out of the way and turn it over to Ann Marie.","Ann Marie Petach","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to provide some brief comments. I'll point out a few highlights in the earnings supplement and, as usual, I'm going to be discussing primarily as-adjusted results.","Overall, 2012 was a very good year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees and we're entering 2013 with great momentum. We generated record full year EPS of $13.68, that's up 15% compared to 2011, reflecting a 5% increase in operating earnings and a 3% increase in revenue compared to a year ago. Record quarterly earnings per share of $3.96 were up 29% compared to a year ago, and that's supported by a 24% increase in operating income, and up 14% compared to the third quarter, and that's supported by a 19% increase in operating earnings.","The fourth quarter operating margin was 42.6% and the full year margin was 40.4%. This reflects cost discipline, strong investment performance and a trend of continuous improvement. The full year margin was up 0.7 point from 2011 and up 2.2 percentage points since 2009 when we acquired BGI and even more than that, when you compare it to the pro forma combined margin. All that data is on Slide 4 of the supplement.","Most importantly, fourth quarter earnings reflected strong revenue growth and positive momentum in net new business across each of our channels. Improved investment performance and positive market. These are important trends as we begin 2013.","In the fourth quarter, clients continued to re-risk with particularly strong flows into equities. We saw $31.2 billion into equities, primarily into ETFs and institutional index product. We also saw $12.4 billion of demand for fixed income products, driven in part by retail investors, who maintained their preference for income-oriented products. Defined contribution plan growth drove flows into multi-asset class products. We also saw a demand for single-strategy hedge funds and private equity fund of funds while returning significant capital as we liquidated our PPIP fund after generating a 23.5% return.","We believe our strong and consistent cash flow model differentiates us within the financial services industry and allows us first to continue to invest in both organic growth and tactical acquisitions such as the recently announced acquisition of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF platform that really expands our presence in Switzerland; secondly, it allows us to pay dividends, which we have consistently increased with earnings growth over time; and thirdly, to repurchase shares in the open market.","In 2012, we generated $3.1 billion of operating cash flow and our -- and continued our discipline of returning that cash to shareholders. We announced today a 12% increase in our dividend to an annual level of $6.72 per share. This is our fourth consecutive year of a dividend increase with 3 of the 4 increases at a double-digit growth rate compared to the prior year. And to put this into perspective, our dividend is now higher than our 2008 EPS.","We've repurchased about 870,000 shares in the quarter for $166 million, and our board approved a 7.5 million share increase in our repurchase authority. This gives us authority to repurchase 10.2 million shares, including the 2.7 million shares remaining under our prior program. And just to review 2012, we repurchased 9.1 million shares for $1.5 billion. And when you combine that with the $1.1 billion we paid in dividends, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to shareholders or 104% of our net income.","I'm going to move to the earnings supplement, which you can find on our website. I'm going to skip a number of slides and focus on just 4 slides that tell most of the story. Let's start with Slide 8. As I mentioned previously, we produced a 29% increase in earnings per share compared to the fourth quarter driven by growth in operating EPS. The as-adjusted results reported here did exclude a $30 million onetime expense. In order to ensure compliance with new OCC guidelines regarding short-term investment funds or STIFs, BlackRock chose to sell certain legacy securities at a loss. And to make a onetime $30 million contribution to the STIF funds to maintain the dollar NAV of the funds, while also complying with the new rules. All of the securities affected by the new OCC guidelines have been purchased in BGI funds prior to BlackRock's acquisition to BGI, and were supported by Barclays under our $2.2 billion capital support agreement.","Last quarter, we had successfully negotiated a partial release of Barclays' coverage in return for a onetime payment into the funds in excess of what we had expected them to receive under the agreements. Prior to the publication, the new OCC guidelines, BlackRock had been really successfully pursuing a hold to maturity or orderly sale of the securities. Importantly, all the securities added to the portfolio since the BGI acquisition have been at much lower risk. The funds are now fully compliant with OCC guidelines that don't go into effect until July.","Also on this page, you can see our nonoperating results. Nonoperating results reflect a $21 million increase in the market value of the co- and seed investment portfolio. And just to mention, the fourth quarter as-adjusted tax rate was 31.4%. 31.5% is likely a good modeling for 2013 -- good rate for modeling 2013 based on what we know as of today.","Moving to Slide 10. Fourth quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, that's up $312 million or 14% from a year ago. I already mentioned the strong performance on the disposition-related portfolio and a number of our single-strategy hedge funds with December locks, which both contributed to growth in performance fees of 63% compared to a year ago. We enter 2013 better positioned than we entered 2012, as we do not face the same performance headwinds we faced coming into 2012. So the performance fee related to the disposition portfolio will not repeat in 2013. And just as a reminder, fourth quarter is our peak performance measurement period, with that just eliminated number of funds actually have performance measurement periods in the first quarter, so you always see some seasonality there.","We delivered full year growth in BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues. That's despite the fact that we successfully managed a $75 billion reduction in advisory assets. Those revenues were replaced with core 11 revenues, revenues which are recurring and provide a solid foundation on which to deliver revenue growth in 2013, as the appetite for both Aladdin and advisory opportunities remains strong.","Base fees, as you can see on Slide 11, were up $218 million with growth across almost every asset class. In the fourth quarter, we generated a 6.4% annualized organic growth in long-dated assets when you exclude the institutional index, which are lower fee and a bit more volatile in the flow basis. The full year organic growth rate on the same basis was about 4.2%. So when you combine this with market improvements, this was a key driver to the 11.7% growth in base fees in the quarter compared to a year ago.","We entered 2013 with the benefit of our 2012 flows -- the 2012 market of improvements and positive flow and organic growth trends. You can see that in the pickup in the growth rate in the second half of 2012. This is all positive  [ph] momentum for 2013 revenue growth. As we look forward to 2013, we've made real progress. Outflows and scientific, equity in the fourth quarter were down to $2 billion. And our outstanding performance track record leaves us very confident in this product. Our fixed income performance is also strong in attracting institutional and retail investors. And in fundamental equities, we've made a series of changes throughout 2012 that are beginning to positively impact performance. A number of trends from 2012 are expected to continue into 2013, such as the growth of ETFs retirement themes, including growth in defined contribution assets and growth in appetite for income, solutions and alternative products.","In addition, we've positioned ourselves well through organic investments to meet investor appetite for emerging market product, as well as to take advantage of more opportunities with clients in Asia and Latin America.","On Slide 12, you can see expenses were up 8%. That compares to the 14% growth in revenue, primarily driven by revenue-related factors, including performance fee-related revenue sharing. The full year comp-to-revenue ratio was 34.9%. This is right in line with our 35% trend, which has been totally consistent over the past 6 years. G&A expense increase is up $30 million were more than explained by our investment in marketing and branding, including the relaunch of our iShares brand.","As we look forward, we will continue to invest in our brands. I would expect 2013 marketing expense to be roughly in line with 2012 for the full year, though we do plan to begin the year with very strong messaging. Given the positive client reaction to the campaign, we remain highly confident that this is a critical, long-term investment in the business.","So to summarize, in 2012, we delivered organic revenue growth driven by our strategic focus areas, healthy margins and strong operating cash flow which we returned to shareholders. We've consistently run the business to serve our clients and deliver value to our shareholders.","Year end is a good time to reflect on a few metrics, which put our consistency and our long-term track record into perspective. Our 2009 dividend was $3.12. Our 2013 dividend of $6.72 is more than double that level. Our pro forma 2009 operating margin for the BlackRock BGI combination was 36.8%. Our 2012 margin of 40.4% has reflected steady year-over-year improvement and has contributed 2 percentage points of operating earnings growth, that's beyond the revenue-related growth in each of the last 2 years and even more than that, in the year of integration. We're particularly proud of this result in light of the investments we've made to grow the business and to serve our clients in an increasingly complex and demanding regulatory environment.","Most importantly, our platform, investments and client relations have generated revenue growth, which has been the core foundation to our overall growth in operating income which, when combined with our share repurchases, has accumulated to an 11% 5-year CAGR in EPS.","Looking ahead, our focus on performance and the strategic needs of our clients and our ability to generate cash flow and reward shareholders leave us well positioned to deliver in 2013 and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Thank you, Ann Marie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. As you can see from the earnings release, our quarterly and year-end financial results were very strong, 14% increase in revenues, 29% increase in diluted EPS compared to the fourth quarter 2011, with accelerating organic AUM growth approaching 7% annualized in the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we generated $47 billion of long-term net new assets. In total, we generated $60.8 billion when you include cash and advisory. For the year, we generated over $107 billion of long-term net inflows. When you exclude the 2 index products that we previously announced in terms of our outflows, the big, large, fixed-income index product that we lost because we chose because of the fee compression that the client demanded. And also, we should keep in mind during the year, we reduced our advisory assets by $75 billion through the distribution to back to the New York Fed on Maiden Lane and paid a nice profit to the American taxpayers related to our success in navigating those portfolios. So at year end, we ended up with the highest AUM ever at $3.8 trillion. But more importantly, this was not just in one product area. Our AUM levels reached the highest levels in institutional, retail and iShares. Another testimony to the broad-based platform that we've created here at BlackRock.","Our equity and multi-asset product classes are each at the highest AUM levels in history. This quarter, we crossed over $1 trillion in institutional index products. In EMEA, we saw client AUM, also at its highest level, now making up over 30% of our total AUM, another point above the diversification of our business model on a geographic base result. So these results clearly demonstrate the tremendous value and the still enormous potential we have in our diversification, our scale and our global reach.","We are seeing proof that the investments we have made in people, products, technology over the past 3 years are paying off. And I think it's the consistency that we've been discussing with you that we are going to invest in people and technology. We're going to invest in brand and that is beginning to pay off in the financial results.","This quarter, we saw positive asset flows across every client channel in every geographic region. At the heart of our diversification strategy has been a strategic emphasis, a combining act of passive [ph]   capacity and capabilities to offer clients a holistic investment solution. To me, it is particularly gratifying that our people have shown quite dramatically that active and passive not only can live together, but indeed flourish to the benefit of our entire organization, but more importantly, to our clients. Our clients are coming to us, not just on one strategy, but a holistic approach. And the fact that we can provide them a beta, a alpha with risk management overlay, no other organization in the world can do that. We also continue to maintain a relentless focus on investment performance and we are seeing continued strong momentum in our fixed income performance and our scientific active equity products, where we have a number of top quartile performers. And we're seeing signs of improvement now in our fundamental equity product sets. And I mentioned last quarter, we have replaced a number of underperforming equity teams over the last 18 months, and I'm pleased to say that most of the changes are behind us. And in each of these new teams, they're performing above their respective benchmarks since they have taken over. These are the investments that we have made, these are the investments that in the short run are very costly, but we are beginning to see the results of those investments. And I feel very confident that we will see those benefits continue in the quarters to come.","Our diversification gives us a powerful competitive edge as we move into 2013. In fact, BlackRock, more than any other organization is equipped to meet these client needs in an environment of unprecedented complexity and uncertainty that will differentiate us and help us ensure that we continue to track clients and nurture increasingly deep, hopefully productive, relationships with them. And that is why I'm as passionate as I have ever been about the future of BlackRock.","Let me turn to the fourth quarter and the full year results. We have been living in a strange investment environment for some time. Economic and political uncertainty persist. Unfortunately, it will -- they will continue to persist. Lower rebate -- rates remain. A tax on savers remains a problem in terms of the underfunding of pension funds -- plans that are getting worse. And demographic because they're changing with more people entering retirement and living much longer  in retirement and are not prepared to meet the needs of elongated longevity of life. So we are seeing with these big macro challenges, we're seeing several megatrends in investment behavior. The secular shift to passive investing in ETFs, a focus on income and retirement, clients are barbelling risk using passive and high alpha product strategies including alternatives. Importantly, these themes represent strategic growth areas for BlackRock with ETFs, income and retirement products, index and alternative strategies, which have accounted for over 50% of our flows in the fourth quarter and 75% of our flows of the year. So these are the themes we discussed over the last few years with consistency. These are the themes that we discussed in our branding initiative to helping our clients understand their issues. And I believe the results of those flows are speaking loudly with selecting the right themes and understanding the macro themes that are impacting the investment environment.","Over the last several years, we've invested heavily in our businesses and businesses and teams to position ourself for these megatrends. In addition, in 2012, we began marketing the BlackRock and iShares brand far more aggressively than ever before. Our marketing communication efforts are designed to raise awareness about the investment challenges facing our clients and the breadth of solutions that BlackRock and iShares offer to help navigate these very challenging environments. These efforts have been extraordinarily positive, even more than I and all of us have expected. As measured by increased awareness of our brands, more traffic to BlackRock directly and through intermediaries, and most importantly, in growth in our market share and assets, which is particularly evident in our ETF flows.","","With ETFs, we continue to witness broad-based adoption among both retail and institutional clients. We finished the fourth quarter with the #1 share globally with -- in ETFs with $35.7 billion of new assets, our highest net new business in a quarter since the merger of BGI in 2009. In addition, iShares finished in 2012 with net new business over $85 billion or a 33% market share. Again, our best year since 2008, representing a 14% organic growth for the year.","I am very pleased to tell you that our iShares AUM ended the year at $753 billion. Clients certainly appear to be re-risking in the fourth quarter. I am not sure I will call it re-risking going forward because when you look at the duration of treasuries, a 15-basis-point movement means you lose your entire coupon or your performance for the year. So what we are seeing is clients understanding the embedded risk that these low interest rates or bonds and are now migrating into equities, not necessarily in re-risking, but looking at the relative values of the income that equities can provide, and importantly, the upside potential in a modestly growing environment in our world. And so this is a huge benefit for us. And I know many people talk about this, a re-risking, and I think we should stop talking about a re-risking because of the nature and the nature of fixed income relative to equities.","Our iShares equity in fixed income AUM is up approximately 27% and 25%, respectively. Our Core Series, the new products we debated in October, had about $4.6 billion in net new business, representing about 17% of our U.S. flows. And all our regions posted positive flows in almost every asset class in ETFs. In the coming year, we will do -- we will expect to see a pickup and actively manage ETFs with a change in the SEC rules on derivative use. But I'm very impressed with the statement from Barron's magazine that came out this weekend. And I state, \"Actively managed ETFs maybe the biggest story that never quite happened.\" And so there was a lot of noise about actively ETFs. We believe in them, but we don't expect them to become anything large to the extent of what core type of ETFs will produce.","I remain very committed to our -- growing our iShares franchise both organically and through acquisitions. Consistently, we announced last week that we entered into agreement with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse to acquire their ETF business. This is our second ETF acquisition in the past 12 months. Claymore, a Canadian ETF platform, was done in January of 2012, another good example of adding unique product capability and unique markets consistent with what we were saying for the last few years, doing fill-in acquisitions where we believe we have great opportunities. And the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse deal also represents a major new commitment for BlackRock in the Swiss market where we see significant opportunity to build out a full suite of investment offerings in Swiss dollars. And this is as evident by our acquisition or -- the Swiss Re Private Equity funds of funds business, which we closed this past September.","Overall, a standout quarter for the year for iShares and we have begun 2013 with an incredible momentum as you could see in the public data of the flows and ETFs in our dominant position.","Let me talk about our other strategic initiatives, and the first one is income, which continues to be a focus for all investors. It remains a key market theme and driver of inflows for us. In a low rate and volatile environment, investors are seeking products that can move consistently with the markets, that could withstand changes in our environment. And those are the products with high dividends and high-yield products that provide enough income to warrant the risks. This is leading to strong demand in our income-oriented products which, last year, we generated over $18 billion in flows. We saw this trend manifest up in our retail channels, where we generated long-term net inflows about $4.1 billion, dominated by fixed income and income-oriented products. Both U.S. international retail generated about $2 billion in net new long flows respectively. For the full year, we saw $11.6 billion of long-term net flows, and for the end of the year long-term retail, about $403 billion in this area.","In 2012, consistent with what we talked about the barbelling of risk, we launched 3 alternative retail products to bring higher alpha institutional quality hedge funds to retail. We experienced one of our strongest quarters to date in the retail alternative flows about $275 million. We now have nearly $10 billion in retail alternative products.","Let me turn to the second strategic initiative and that was retirement, which continues to be a theme about longevity, aging population, changing demographics worldwide which are driving new investment decisions. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution which is driving strong flows for us. We, in our channel, we generated $29 billion in net flows for the quarter, which represents a 9% organic growth. There's no other DC manager that had a 9% organic growth and of that, $2.4 billion and that's inflows in the fourth quarter. Our LifePath target date suite is a key component of our retirement solutions, generating $3.3 billion of new business in the quarter and $14 billion of flows during the entire year.","2013 will mark the 20th year since we introduced this product, the first target date product in the industry. Another example of the innovation of our platform and anticipating needs for our clients.","As we anticipated -- let me go into institutional products first. The institutional products produced about $7.2 billion in net long-term flows, driven largely by barbelling and continued to shift in the multi-asset and passive. For the year, we saw about $11 billion in net long-term flows, once again, excluding those 2 outflows that we proactively removed. And long-term institutional AUM at the end of 2012 ended at about $2.3 trillion.","And as we anticipated, the shift to passive has proven to be a significant and long-term trend in the industry, one in which we are very well positioned to benefit. Globally, we added about $15.2 billion in net new business in our institutional index business in the fourth quarter and crossed the $1 trillion threshold of institutional index products.","We saw outflows in our institutional active equity and some outflows in our fixed income products. The equity outflows was largely due to rotation out of a large cap equity style box and additional withdrawal from our scientific equity one. Some of this, we would expect it as we changed our managers. Some people buy by contract will change their -- they will pull out assets if we change their managers. This is something we anticipated. This is something that we expected. However, our new teams in these products have already shown a healthy change in our performance, and we expect to see that change over the long period of time as we continue to build out positive alpha in those product areas.","And in the fixed income product areas, we are seeing clients trying to navigate, some moving out of core fixed income, into other products whether it is alpha products, like hedge funds, or in some cases reallocating back into equities.","We still believe there is a lot of opportunity in fixed income, so I don't want to sound harsh about it. I think many of the income products of fixed income, we have great products. I am very pleased to say, which I'll get into a minute, about our performance. Our performance has been extraordinary in some of these products that we've already emphasized.","Let me touch on -- before I talk about performance, let me talk about BlackRock Solutions. Revenues were up 2% for the year and 8% since the last quarter. Our Aladdin business posted a very strong yearly and quarterly growth of about 16% for the year and 10% for the quarter. We added $3.5 trillion in new assets on to our Aladdin platform, with the addition of 16 clients and expanding into 10 existing client mandates. I am very pleased to say that we now have 51 Aladdin clients, and we are analyzing on behalf of our clients' assets now close to $14 trillion of assets that Aladdin now helps our clients in terms of analyzing their risk.","We see, at this moment, more opportunity for Aladdin and the use of Aladdin than we've ever seen in the history of our outsourcing of Aladdin products to our clients. The pipeline is extremely robust. The dialogues we're having for utilization of our Aladdin products has never been as strong.","Let me now touch on performance, which I'm very pleased to talk about. We have, over the last year, talked about how we have this relentless focus on performance, making sure we fill the needs and the expectations of our clients. Our fixed income platform reap benefits from the past changes with strong 2012 performance. 84% of our  fixed income AUM exceeds its benchmarks for 1- and 3-year period of time. We have -- our 3-year performance is better than the majority of our large competitors. And I'm very pleased to say not just in our core products, but we are top decile in our high-yield products. And importantly, our strategic income opportunity product, which is a go-anywhere fund, we are in the top quartile in that product for 1- and 3-year period, beating most of our large peers.","In our scientific active equity area, we are going to make a very large push in 2013 because our results are terrific, with 84% of our products exceeding their benchmarks for 1 year and 90% for 3 years. A tremendous turnaround for the team. This product has better alpha than about 95% of all large cap series products in the world. And so we talk about this as a quant product. This product should be sold to the non-quant players. We hope to be showing this to clients who have large core holdings and large cap products because we have a very, very competitive story to-date.","It's no mystery, we made some large changes in our fundamental equities because of mixed performance, with less than 50% of our AUM above our benchmark. We're not satisfied with it. We made some very large changes with the knowledge that in some of those changes, we're going to lose assets. This is a fundamental belief that we needed to upgrade our teams, build stronger and more robust teams, and I am very pleased with a short-term results of our new teams. Our emerging equity team that came on board early last year, they were over 700 basis points above the benchmark, exceeding almost everybody in terms of performance. And we are in dialogue with clients about these products.","Our European equity, where quite frankly, there's just not much flows into European equities in the last year, but we grew by about $3 billion in European equities. Our 1, our 3- and 5-year track record is in the top quartile. So we have these pockets that have done well. We have had pockets of area that have done poorly, and we replaced those teams and are building those teams up to be much more respectable.","In our multi-asset product area, we were about at the 49 percentile for some of the core products, not acceptable, right at the middle essentially. And we are working it very heavily in making sure our teams continue to build performance that hopefully approaches the top quartile. I am very confident in our teams though. Last year, despite being around the 50th percentile, we still produced 11% returns for our clients in that product. And I should say, it is now the 10th year in a row we earned and generated 11% returns. So on an absolute basis, these products have done fabulously well. On a relative basis, we were right in the middle of the pack. And we hope with the investments of -- in our teams to augment our existing great team that we have, that will -- this will benefit in terms even a better performance.","And in alternative, we continue to build momentum, and we've had solid, solid performance in some of our products. One of our fixed income products had a 39% return. Other fixed income products had close to 15% returns. It's certainly -- we talked about the PPIP was a huge success we had for the American taxpayers and our clients in terms of 23.5% net performance. That's after fees, by the way, to our clients.","Let me look ahead in 2013. I am very thrilled, excited about the coming year, probably more excited than I have in many years. We are seeing tangible results from the changes in the firm's architecture that we announced last summer to better align the needs of our clients. We're seeing a strong response in the investments that we built in terms of investments in brand and other things like that. And importantly, we continue to focus on execution to achieve consistent organic growth and momentum.","We're starting to see the results of that in the last 2 quarters. Since the start of a year, we've generated over $14 billion in new fundings, and we're also looking at about a $49 billion largely institutional pipeline. So the funding at the beginning of the year has been large, larger than any year to have $14 billion of fundings in the first 2 weeks and still -- and having a $49 billion pipeline.","So growth is coming from an increasingly global set of clients, with the AUM manage for international clients approaching about 50%. And we recognize the importance of reaching clients through the depths of our products, our technology and our global reach.","Our focus areas over the past year have all shown good traction and will remain our focus in 2013. We continue to be heavily focused on ETFs. We'll be focused on retirement and income, alternatives, and risk management solutions will remain the growth areas for 2013.","In particular, we are putting even a greater emphasis on emerging markets and, particularly, China represents a key opportunity for BlackRock as both the destination and source for investments. China's market development has been marked by a long periods of status quo, punctuated by regulatory driven and often unanticipated changes. To succeed, we realized we need to be engaged in the key discussions and decisions, particularly helping create options to be in the position to execute successfully when there's opportunities emerging in China. And to best position BlackRock in this market, we're developing key relationships by expanding our investments and identifying senior leaders as demonstrated by our recent announcement this week that Hsueh-ming Wang will be joining us as our Chairman of BlackRock China, which is a fantastic hire for us. We have a true noted leader who will be helping us and me guide our position in China.","We already have nearly $200 billion in emerging market assets with the majority of those AUM passive products. We believe there's a tremendous opportunity to grow our active franchise. While it takes time, with strong managers, with performance that will attract clients' attention. For example, we hired a top-tier portfolio manager for Asian equities last winter and already his strong results are gaining traction with our clients.","So looking forward, we are going to embrace the changing investment landscape and evolve our organization to maintain superior performance and to meet the changing needs of our clients. The drive for performance and excellence is implicit in everything we do, every moment, every day, every time we intersect with our clients. Our business is a fiduciary-based business. And as a fiduciary, investment performance remains our top priority.","We are also focused on managing ourself efficiently and working smarter to ensure strong returns to our shareholders. As Ann Marie discussed, we remain committed to returning value to our shareholders. In 2012, we returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders with our dividend and continued strong repurchase activity, buying a total of 9.1 million shares for the year. This will continue to be a priority in 2013. I am very pleased to say that our board approved that 12% increase in our annual dividend and has given us the discretion to purchase additional 7.5 million shares, which is bringing up our capacity now to 10.2 million shares.","The things that we have spent -- in the last few years preparing for and positioning our firms are now happening. I've discussed margins in every one of these calls. I said when there's beta, we will scale appropriately. Our business is scaling appropriately. And in the fourth quarter, we posted a 42.6% operating margin, which is a result of strong organic growth, beta, market discipline. And remember, this is a 40%-plus margin in a year where we absorbed a substantial new investment in our brand, investment in our teams and unprecedented levels of regulatory costs. I've always said that we could easily break through the 40% margin in strong markets, and we did. I continue to believe a full year margin of greater than 40% is appropriate, so we will continue to drive efficiencies to making sure that we continue to build our platform and to build the most efficient asset management firm in the world.","So in closing, the key takeaways for me are this: One, after 3 years of continuous evolution and focus in investing in our people, our products, our technology and, more recently, our brand, our clients and partners are understanding our business model more than ever before and the results are validating the benefits of the diverse business model we have built. Secondarily, we've continued to differentiate ourselves from our peers, which uniquely positions us to continue to be driving momentum in 2013. And three, we are relentlessly focused on executing against our strategic growth priorities.","Let me just state one thing because, obviously, there's always -- there was some uncertainty about leadership at BlackRock. Let me be very clear about my views of the BlackRock leadership. We have what I believe the best, the deepest management team in the industry. Myself and my team will be leading the business for years to come with skill and innovation. I can't tell you how proud I am in working with my team and how much I enjoy having a leadership team that helps me and the entire firm navigate a better future for our clients, a better future for our shareholders.","Once again, I need to just thank our employees for really delivering a great year for our clients in terms of performance and what I would say, a great year for our shareholders in delivering the financial results that are expected from us.","With that, thank you, everyone. And we'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  Our first question will come from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I've got 2 questions; they're kind of related. One, there's widespread belief that investors will reengage in equities and you said in your prepared remarks about re-risking. I'd love to hear -- and we think of re-risking as more tactical in short term -- but would love to hear your latest thoughts on reengagement, which we think is more longer term and strategic. So when accounting for the fiscal cliff, are there indications of reengagement in either the retail or institutional investors? And maybe if so, what are you seeing differently in the beginning of this year or even the end of last year, that may have been different than what we saw in either early 2011 or even early 2010?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. Ken, I was trying to talk about that. I agree with you, re-risking is a tactical trade. Obviously, in some areas, that may be happening. But the flows that we're seeing institutionally through iShares and mutual funds, it appears to me that people -- the Federal Reserve's actions in terms of persistent low rates and now making, in my mind, fixed income much riskier, it's hard for me to say moving from fixed income products to equities is a re-risking trade. It's more of a diversification of risk trade maybe. And we are seeing very -- beginning to see some large scale, what I'll call, systematic changes in behavior. Since the beginning of the year, we have one large institutional client heavily oriented towards fixed income. They awarded us about $6.5 billion entirely in equities, mostly in index. But in our conversation with the client, it is a reorientation of risk, how they think about it. And as I said, this investor has predominantly been a fixed income investor, and they're diversifying their portfolios accordingly. And so I think these are -- the movements we're beginning to see is -- it's not tactical anymore. It is much more of a secular movement. And I think that will -- even in the ETF flows, you're seeing a consistent flow. If you look at the flows year-to-date, and I'm talking about the first 15, 16 days in ETF, the flows, I think, as an industry are more than 80% in fixed income. This doesn't feel to me that it's a risk on tactical movement. It's people are looking for exposure in more equity-like products.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I have a quick question, maybe following up to Ken's a little bit just on this topic. I mean, you gave that example where that one institutional client is looking at shifting its allocation towards equities. In your view, I mean how -- if we see that more broadly or if you've seen them more broadly, do you -- outside of maybe dividend strategies, I mean, how do you think -- do you think most of that will actually flow to beta strategies, like your index products, or more to ETFs? And to what extent do you think or the fact that tax rates have gone up at least on individuals and tax flow accounts that, that may even accelerate demand for ETFs and the index products at least in the retail world?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, I mean, this one client is a non-U.S. client so tax rates had nothing to do with this one client. It was a global client. I think everyone are looking at different strategies. As you said, I think there is a strong movement towards dividend-oriented products. There is strong movement into beta products, as you barbell, for those clients who are barbelling risk or going into beta products and may be at 20% allocation in the higher alpha products. But it's our view, and this is why we're making these large investments, there's going to be great opportunities in the alpha products. And so I think what you're going to see over the course of a secular trend, which may take 1 to 3 years, maybe longer, you're going to see people, as they get comfortable in equities, maybe through beta products, they're going to start navigating and seeing opportunities in alpha products as long as the risk reward, total return after expenses are greater than the beta products. And so to me, we believe that will be the trend. We're betting on it. We're investing in it. And quite frankly, I'm happy we're not seeing this today because we're building our track record with a lot of our fundamental teams right now. And if the re-risking was going on or the secular change in the active equities today, I'd miss a lot of it because I don't have the duration of time and performance with the new teams. We benefit in some of our teams but not all our teams. So we are pretty pleased with the reorientation into equities chiefly going into beta products. And as we build those relationship with our clients, and this is -- when we did the BGI transaction, I said from the very beginning to a lot of people's skepticism, that having beta and alpha side-by-side is a very strong position. Most people never thought they could be side-by-side. We believe by working with our clients, we're agnostic whether they go into beta or alpha. We want to have a relationship. By having our clients right now going into beta, we know what their emphasis are doing. We know what they're thinking about. And then we now have time as they think to relook at alpha products, that we could have that dialogue. So this is playing totally into our strategy.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. And maybe just a follow-up on the money fund business, just kind of curious. I mean, yourselves and a bunch of your peers have announced just in the past week or so about reporting daily NAVs. And in general, at least my general sense is, I guess, the industry is kind of, yourselves including, maybe come to the conclusion that at this point it may not be perfect but maybe floating NAVs is the best solution for some products at least. Can you maybe talk a little bit about your client reaction to that to the extent you've had interactions about it or...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Sure, sure. Let me just be precise with it. We have always had a constructive positioning in this. We always believe that we needed to change the money market industry to make it much safer with less systemic risks. We always believe that we need to create a sounder product for our clients and users of the product. So I've always believed that we needed to have a constructive dialogue with the regulators in Europe and in the United States, so we have taken a much more constructive approach than some of our peers over the years on this point. I am very pleased with the movement that we made in this industry. This was led by Goldman Sachs. But I do believe daily NAV is a good step in -- by providing more transparency, which we've always said at BlackRock, we're prepared to do this. And we may disagree with the outcomes and how they -- what ultimately comes and how do we navigate risk, but we're having a constructive dialogue. I do believe that net result will be a safer money market fund industry, and I believe the product will be sound for investors. I'm not here to suggest that we're 100% supporting floating rate NAV. We believe there's other approaches that could probably achieve the same results without a float, but I'm not -- we're going to be constructive on this. But the key element is to make this a product in which our investors see opportunities to invest to make excess returns. At the same time, making sure as an industry, we don't represent real risk for the industry and for society.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned, Larry, maybe the last call, last couple of calls, the opportunity to grow the ETF business and the fixed income platform. I'm just a little bit curious if you could maybe update your thoughts on that and where you see the greatest growth from, either geographic or product-wise as well?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. Rob Kapito is here as President. He's spending a great deal of time on this. He is the BlackRock board member on our ETF iShares platform. Rob, why don't you just come here and answer that question.","Robert Steven Kapito","So Bill, we see -- we still see a lot of demand in the emerging market sector because clients are still a bit confused as to how to take advantage of the individual areas in the emerging markets, and this gives clients great diversification very quickly with liquidity in that market. So we think that is an area that's going to continue to grow. We also see a significant amount of people that are looking for buy and hold, and that's why we created the new Core Series. And we're starting to see a lot of interest in that Core Series, especially from the individual investor. And that's very exciting and that's why we created that, so we'll continue to be talking about that. And then, of course, we have some innovations that we're going to introduce into the marketplace. One is an ETF that's going to look a bit like a bond but have all the benefits of an equity and the attributes of a bond. And with all people struggling right now to find diversification in the bond market, we think this will be a very liquid and transparent way to get into that market. So we're bringing the BlackRock innovation into the ETF market. And we hope in the next several months to make several introductions into this market with products that we think are very, very much in demand from our clients, both in fixed income and in equities. And I would say the other 2 areas that we're very excited about, of course, is the high-yield area. As people look for more income and diversification, the HYG product that we have continues to grow, and we have top decile managers in that area in the active space. And then we also have the ETF space to offer them product as well. And lastly, with the continued demand for income, our dividend income ETFs are also seeing a lot of interest. So we're very bullish on the products that we currently have. But we're going to bring the BlackRock innovation to bear very, very shortly, and we'll be introducing those into the market. You'll hear a lot about them.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just, Larry, coming back to margins and your commentary about at least 40% margin is notable. Throughout 2012, I think it was a very big year for expenses that you highlighted a few things. As you looked out to this year notwithstanding the marketing spend you mentioned this first quarter about messaging, but are you at a point where the investment spend can't keep up with the revenue growth, that could allow for the margins to be even structurally a bit higher. I mean, all I keep hearing is scale and flow leverage. And so I'm wondering, can you actually plow the money back fast enough not to let the margins go a bit higher?","Laurence Douglas Fink","As you know, Bill, we do manage our investments very accordingly to where we see the -- very specifically related to where we believe our margins should be. We made a lot of investments. I don't believe we have to make as large of investments in terms of portfolio teams. Now we need to start beginning to see the revenues there. But we are going to innovate. As Rob discussed, we'll be -- we are investing a lot of money in technology. We are actually investing a lot of money right now in terms of making sure we're compliant with all of the regulatory issues, which I think is going to be a burden, a much greater burden for our competitors because I don't think they have the technology to do that because I think all of us are going to be facing much greater scrutiny in terms of regulation. And this is not just a U.S. phenomenon, it's a global phenomenon. It's true in Japan and Europe and everywhere else. So it is -- it's broad-based, and we're spending a lot of time on that. But no, if we have a stable to upwardly moving markets, there is no reason not to think that our margins can increase and, therefore, we're not going to need to invest as much going forward as you would continue to see margin increases. But look it, I've come a long ways in the last few years. By talking about baseline around 40% margins, and we've been able to deliver -- some of you think I'm a little too pessimistic on how I try to manage margins, but I really do believe -- if I had to think about what we've done the last 3 years in terms of investing and now we're starting to see those benefits of investing, at the same time, very big increases in our margins. So we are -- we will continue to invest where we see appropriate. I will continue to buy fill-in companies in terms of capital management, buying companies that we see -- the opportunities like we saw with Claymore or the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF platform. So it's going to be a mixture of investing and passing through higher margins to our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just given your focus on organic revenue growth really versus organic AUM growth, can you provide some perspective here on the mix shift that we're seeing away from active equities and alternatives and maybe look at it a different way? And I also know lower industry demand for C assets [ph] is kind of impacting this. But what do you really expect management fee accretion from growth from higher fee products? Is this something you're still looking for?","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. I mean, we still -- in our trends, we are still seeing the fact that revenue growth, from what we see in our own data, is exceeding AUM growth. And that's founded on -- some of the growth we're experiencing is in channels and opportunities where those fee relationships inherently are higher. And if you just think about within, for example, the fixed income world, what's more appealing now is a more specialized product compared to a more core product. So we have been seeing that trend within our 2012 data, and we do expect that again in 2013.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just a follow up on the Solutions revenue, which had a really nice sequential pickup here. Can you help us think about any seasonality or unusual items that may have impacted the fourth quarter results? And also, can you provide us an update on the revenue mix here? I believe there's kind of 3 main segments, one is sort of risk management Aladdin, two is long-term AUM and three is really short-term assignments.","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. Oh...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Oh, go ahead -- I'll talk about the -- you talk about...","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. So first of all, with respect to the quarter, it was a very clean quarter. A year ago, we had a onetime large completion. So when you look at it compared to a year ago, that's the difference you are seeing. But if you look at this fourth quarter, it was a pretty clean quarter. And as I've said before, the mix of those core Aladdin revenues are 65% to 70% of those overall revenues. So you're down to what I would call the non-repetitive. We've got to earn them again, or a vast minority of the assignments. So, so much of our BRS assignment revenues are now coming from the core repeatable revenues.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I would say what you're also seeing is a number of completions in the setting up of the Aladdin assignments. As you know, the setup of Aladdin, the implementation phase, very low fee, very highly cost in terms of manpower -- of the implementation. And when you begin to now go from implementation to having the full Aladdin setup working for our clients, then the overall fees kick in. And that's also what you're starting to see on the revenue line of Aladdin revenues. And as I always used to say, sometimes we got to balance it out because when you are doing the initiation and the setup of Aladdin, it's -- they're very low fees and very high expenses, harmful for our overall margins. But once that kicks in, obviously it's a net positive in the margins. And so you're seeing the completion of implementations and the beginning in some of these clients of the full Aladdin setup. And as I said, we have an extraordinary pipeline in 2013 in terms of the Aladdin utilization.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe a question on the cash flow. You guys increased the dividend and increased the authorization. I think if we look over the past 2 years just on the buyback side, you had some ongoing buybacks and then you had some, I don't know, unusual or the big tranches. So when we start thinking about going forward, your strategy on the dividend seems very clear. But when you look at the remaining, say, roughly $2 billion of cash flow that you generate, do you have like a sense of like priority of like 50% of that will be used for ongoing buybacks and 50% maybe for small acquisitions, investments, seed, regulatory? Just trying to get a sense if we can somewhat predict...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, it's hard for me to -- first of all, we do have a strong consistent dividend policy. Then the rest of the capital management I look at are the opportunities we're investing. If I see opportunities in investing that are more creative than share repurchase, I will do more of that. If I don't see as many opportunities -- or we have many opportunities that don't require that much money. Our commitment is to be really robust in our capital management after, as you said, regulatory stuff and all that other stuff. So there could be a moment in which the ratios move quite extraordinary to all share repurchase of our cash to a period of time when we see opportunities, a smaller repurchase program because of opportunities in the inorganic acquisition area. But you should assume, if we believe -- if we are going to do an acquisition -- in every acquisition, it has to be accretive to share repurchase.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned in the past that the ETFs, sometimes you experience some seasonality as the year goes on and fourth quarter is strong. But it also feels like the structural growth in the adoption of the ETF product is underlying, driving a lot of the strength. So I just want to get a sense, like 2012 was a strong year overall, the fourth quarter was strong. Do you still tend to see some seasonality in the first half of the year? Or do you feel like, given the marketing spend, given the structural growth that you're seeing, that's enough to offset some of that seasonality?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, last year, we didn't see that seasonality that we saw all the years before. So we always used to see a huge fourth quarter and outflows in the first quarter. And last year, that did not happen. And so far, this year, we're seeing strong inflows after a strong fourth quarter, which, if this persists, I think it is fair to say there's structural growth in the industry itself. And it certainly feels like there's structural growth in the industry. And as the largest participant in this, we're a beneficiary of that. So I'm not going to make one claim at the moment. I don't think I have enough information. But if we're -- in our conversations with our clients, more and more clients are adopting a utilization of ETFs. In fact, clients today that have heavily used lower fee index funds, they're now saying, \"Okay, I want a percent of my index funds to have even greater liquidity.\" And so they're seeing -- so they're seeing some now investing in higher cost ETFs relative to their index fund, but that allows them with much more flexibility and portability for them in terms of navigating their asset allocations. So you are seeing more utilization, more adaptation of ETFs, I think, worldwide.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question on the alternative business. You mentioned that you're growing your alternative retail AUM. You had some good flows there. But I guess if you look at the overall dollars in the alternative buckets, still relatively small, I guess, versus the totality of the business and maybe the opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about this convergence, which I think might be a bit of a buzzword? But I mean, the alternative retail opportunity for you guys, what that means and what sort of the outlook is to grow alternative product in the retail channel?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, let me let Rob answer that.","Robert Steven Kapito","So like institutional investors that are trying to get some more yield and better returns in a low rate environment, the retail investor has also now started to look for alternative investments. Previous -- in previous years, you had to be an accredited investor, and there wasn't a wrapper that was sufficient to be able to sell to the individual investors. And over the last several years, we've cracked that code and have been able to create mutual funds that have alternative type investments in them. We have launched a series of these mutual funds now that have alternative type investments in them in the various sectors, whether they be anything from commodities, real estate and almost quasi hedge fund-like products that we are already seeing some very strong demand and have interest from all of the wire house systems to be the manufacturer of that particular product for their distribution. So we expect that to continue. The second area that I would put in alternatives would be model-based investing where a lot of the individual investors are also clamoring for more yield. And that is going to be distributed through models that we are going to provide to the distribution houses where they will either execute the trades based upon our models, or we will execute the trades, and a good portion of that is going to be in alternative investments. So today, there is much better wrappers and much better products that are going to allow the individuals to invest. And we expect to play a very big role in the manufacturing of that product for the individual investor.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just in the multi-asset class segment, if you will. Can you talk a little bit about how those products are being used in the channel? I mean, obviously, performance, is there sort of, I guess, more of a risk-management approach when you think about those products versus maybe more sort of upmarket capture vehicles? Or you could just discuss what's happening in multi-asset class a bit.","Robert Steven Kapito","So there are both sides to that. There are those that want to take more risk in those, and there are those -- there are probably more people that want a risk-managed approach to the multi-asset product. And there, again, we're doing the same thing for the individual investor that we're doing for the retail investor. I would just say that the space has become very crowded because a lot of the smaller hedge funds are crowding into spaces such as the distressed areas such as the credit area. But the biggest piece of that is going to be what we're going to call \"outcome type\" products where people are looking for a specific outcome and -- or you can describe that as target date. And we're putting together those type of products in the multi-asset area that I don't think a lot of our competitors are really thinking about. And that takes a lot of technology and risk management in order to provide the appropriate outcome to the type of investor that's there. So in the generic hedge fund, distressed type multi-asset, there we're seeing a lot of competition. But in the multi-asset where it's more risk managed, target date, outcome oriented, that's where we're really going to be able to grow. One area that we have that you'll notice, we're working on the performances, our global allocation product. It's a flagship product. Over any 10-year period you want to look at, it's had stellar performance. Last year, our performance was not as good as some of our other competitors, and that's because we had a little less risk on it. But the long-term performance is very good, and it's a go anywhere-type of product, global-type product that clients will continue to look for, and we have a good long-term record in that. And we hope to continue to raise more assets in it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I just wanted to come back to the ETF business and maybe a little bit more detail. You just talked about the strength in the fourth quarter and year-to-date, but I think one of the things we would point out is clearly, that you've benefited from the whole index shift between, well -- that Vanguard announced. And when we talk to some investors in that space, clearly, some people switched right away back to your product. So just wondering, when you talk to institutional investors in this space, do you think there's still a big pipeline of folks that are evaluating and might shift back to -- or want to be in the MSCI products and will be in your iShares products? Or do you think that's basically behind us and it's now a battle for new flows?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, first of all, Vanguard is a tremendous firm, a great competitor. They're a big client of ours. We have never done anything in -- as something that we are -- a fight between BlackRock and Vanguard, that's a topical myth by the media. We are just trying to execute our strategy and provide what we think are great outcomes. We are still in conversation with a number of large-based clients right now on our emerging market product to go into our emerging market ETF. And so specifically, to your question, there are still more flows to come, we think. But let me just cite one other reason. Our tracking error on that product was better than our competitors. And so when -- once again, people just talk about management fees, and we have kept on telling everyone, \"You're not looking at the total way how they should be looked at.\" Especially for institutions who are cognizant of tracking error bid\/ask spread among the issues around management fees. And so when we look at our positioning and our -- even in our emerging market product area, we had a very competitive product last year. So it's not just because of a change of index. It is also because, if you look at our success in navigating that portfolio in 2012, we had better tracking error, and we have a very tight bid\/ask spread. So you add tracking error bid\/ask spread plus the fees, they're very competitive to each other. And that's how we look at everything. And I think the marketplace is starting to recognize it in terms of efficiency for after-tax. No firm can claim better than us. We spend a lot more time in making sure our clients get a complete product, whether that is tracking error, whether that's tax efficiency. So we think about all these things. We just don't think about one dimension. And I do believe it is that consistency of looking at it on behalf of our clients, whether this is the appropriate index, whether we have the right tracking error, whether we are managing to an after-tax return, I think it all comes together that we have a very compelling product.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very fair. But just to stay on the index side just for one more minute, or one more question here, I think in the past, when you've talked about the whole pricing competition and so forth, you've also said that maybe in the process, you might be able to reduce some of the index fees you pay to save some of the expenses. So does this whole index selection now show that there's actually a lot of power in the index and we'll not see abilities to reduce pricing there? And then on the flip side, does it actually give you more appetite to be in that index business yourself, if regulators allow it, either by buying somebody or building something out organically, which I think you've talked about before?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So as a fiduciary, we have to be relentless in terms of our expenses. We have constant dialogue with our service providers, whether they're index providers or custodial banks, to get the lowest fees possible. At this moment, we have no true desire in buying an index provider. They do a very fine job, but their -- our job is to be a fiduciary, making sure we get the lowest fees, but also helping -- being partners with the index providers. And quite frankly, we believe MSCI provides a great index product. They've done a very good job, in my mind, navigating global index products. And we will continue to work with them, but we will continue to be a fiduciary on behalf of our clients, making sure we have the lowest fees.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just wanted to come back to the institutional client that you mentioned who is predominantly fixed income switching back to equities or in discussions to do so.","Laurence Douglas Fink","They have done it.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it's done. So curious to get -- I've seen you talk about it in the past increased allocations to alternatives, now we have this whole debate of fixed income to equity. So that particular client, what sort of allocation strategy did they have before in percentages by asset bucket, if you will? And how are they shifting that now?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I don't -- that's -- I've never -- I don't know that. That's not terribly transparent to me. We -- but it's fair to say this client is heavily dominated by fixed income products by the nature of its liabilities, the nature of what it historically looked at risk. And what they're saying today, that because of low interest rates -- and keep in mind, this is not a dollar-based institution. It's not a U.S. institution. They believe you're going to be able to get higher returns with the appropriate risk. So it was an extraordinary amount of reallocation into equities and we are a benefit of that. We having dialogues with many global institutions now about this whole idea of relooking at equities, and I think this is going to be one of the major themes of 2013. And as I said, I don't know if this is -- we should call this a re-risking strategy anymore. That's my new view. It's looking at, on a risk-adjusted basis, where -- on a relative value, where you can have the most appropriate returns. And so I think you're going to see movement -- more movement into equities, and this has been my overall theme personally for the last 2 years, and it's now starting to manifest in behavior with our clients.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. So along the same lines, and then I'll -- just one last one from me after that is, is there an intermediate step in terms of -- do you think that balance funds, hybrid funds take more inflows than equities in the near term instead of just a larger shift from one asset class to the other?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No question. There are going to be some -- especially on the retail side, you're going to see people looking for more -- a global allocation-type of product, giving the management of a fund the responsibility of allocating across sector and product and region. So it really depends. So a lot of clients believe they could do that themselves. They have their own CIO, and they're using our products as vehicles in doing so. And other ones are going to say, \"Why don't you guys do that on top of what we already asked you to do?\" So I don't view it as one trend in that. It really depends on the specificity of a client. Does the client have their own CIO? Do they not? How do the clients think about it? Do the clients have consultants -- if a client has a consultant, they may think a little differently because a consultant will do the allocation, working alongside with the client. So I don't think there's one prescribed behavior. I am pleased to say that we are in dialogue with many clients working alongside with their consultants, working directly with the clients in terms of talking about risk exposures in a low rate environment.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one for me, and sorry to make you sort of repeat yourself on the operating margin, but we've talked a lot about the marketing spend and where you are on that, but you also made a comment that a lot of the hiring on the equity side, the active side of the business, is kind of behind you. So given that, if we continue to see a bigger portion of your assets and revenues in the passive side of the business, is it fair to assume that the comp ratio should go down? So that should be an incremental benefit to the margin as well, right?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, I hope our barbelling at BlackRock continues and we have just as great a performance fees, if not greater. I am very pleased to pay a lot of comp when our teams pay -- provide the returns that they did. So I'm not going to make a judgment on that, but if -- there's no question, if more and more money goes into beta products, then you would see changes in the comp line in terms of that behavior. But our success will be -- if a lot of money goes into beta, there is going to be money going into the alternative strategies that we get a component of that, too.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess just a follow up on a comment you made about some of the outflows you have been seeing on the active equity side as a result of the personnel turnover. I guess, where are you in that process? And do you think we should see more of that over the next kind of 6, 12 months?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Actually, with -- one of our recent teams that we brought on we're actually in the process of potentially having a big block of assets moving to BlackRock. So -- but if we have the performance with our new teams where -- we will not see the outflow. So I don't -- I think we're chiefly behind. I know of one area where we -- I think in the first quarter we're going to see some outflows, but it's very modest. But in all the other cases, I think those outflows are chiefly behind us. And as I said, we're now seeing -- we're now in dialogue of a big block going into one of our new team's products.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess on the regulatory front, you've already addressed the money markets side. But I guess, if you could maybe update us on the sec lending potential changes in Europe and then any other issues out there that you are either monitoring or thinking might be impactful to the business over the next kind of [indiscernible]...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, there's no regulatory changes for sec lending. There was a non -- there was a group that's talking about sec lending, but it was -- there's nothing -- that was not a regulatory statement. It was just a group that's saying there should be issues. So that's not -- we're going to have more supervision. We're going to have to be more buttoned down. We're prepared to be working with all our regulators and providing more data, more research. To me, that's going to be -- we're going to see a lot more scrutiny and much more need for information to our regulators worldwide. So it's not -- it's something we're living with. We're not fighting. It's just part of our business. But I don't -- we're going to see in Europe the whole changes in retrocessions, so the -- that is going to be probably the biggest change. How do you reward your distributors? How do distributors make money in an area where there's no retrocessions? That's going to be the big change in 2013 in Europe. And quite frankly, I think, worldwide, that question is being asked. How transparent are the costs of execution? How transparent are the costs of information to the retail clients going to be? And how does that impact manufacturers like BlackRock and everyone else? But we're in front of it. We believe we are navigating this quite successfully. As you know, part of our investment in teams, we have teams in Brussels and we have teams in Washington working with our regulators. And so we're involved in that. That was part of our investment, making sure we are considered a constructive information provider to our regulators that we're helping them think about risks and thinking about how they should navigate going forward. So it is just part of our business, and we're not fighting it. And we're building the functionality to provide the information that our clients -- that our regulators are going to ask of us. And I would underscore -- they're going to ask us for that information. They're going to ask every one of our competitors. Maybe that's one of the reasons why Aladdin is picking up more an accelerated type of request for Aladdin because we're going to be in a pretty good position by having our Aladdin position, by providing the transparency of information to regulators. I can't say that about a lot of other firms, and that could be why we're seeing more inquiry.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Hopefully, everybody enjoys 2013. And let's hope Washington gets its act together and that we could have a sensible solution in terms of our deficits. And if we have that, we can have a very productive year in our markets. That is, in my mind, the biggest drag to our economy. The economy is not dragging by itself, but Washington is dragging our economy by inaction and importantly, confusion. So I'll leave it at that. Thanks, everyone. Thanks to all the employees. I look forward to talking to everybody after the first quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

My name is David, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Inc. Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and Head of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Patrick Olson. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Olson, you may begin your conference.","Patrick Olson","Thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining BlackRock's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. ","Before we begin, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed, with the SEC, reports which lists some of the factors which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements. Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. ","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ann Marie to discuss our financial results. Ann Marie?","Ann Marie Petach","Thank you, Patrick. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. I know it's a busy earnings morning out there today. I want to take you through the financial results for the quarter and the full year, which were quite positive given the extraordinary global market volatility. ","BlackRock delivered strong financial results this year, with full year EPS up 8%. This performance highlights the strength of the company, the breadth of our product set and our global footprint. Combined with our risk tools, these strengths uniquely position us to meet the diverse needs of clients in this challenging environment. While flows for the quarter were strong relative to the industry, we were not immune to the impact of the current markets on our revenue. Still, we maintained strong margins by balancing beta-driven revenue effects with expense management. ","We also took actions to position the business well going into 2012. The business generated operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the year, allowing us to fund a large return of cash to shareholders. This includes the repurchase of 618,000 shares, costing about $100 million in the fourth quarter. Larry's going to be talking more about the market environment generally and our focus areas for 2012. ","The key takeaway for me is that in the turbulent markets we've been seeing, BlackRock demonstrated that our product and geographic diversification is working. We are built to help clients in markets like these, and we can perform well despite global headwinds and macro uncertainties. With that, let me quickly walk you through the results. As I make my comments, I'll be referring to the supplement. You can find it on our website. And as usual, I'll be talking about primarily as-adjusted results.","As you can see on Slide 1 of the supplement, we announced full year earnings of $11.85, again, reflecting a year-over-year growth in EPS of 8%. This was driven by a 7% increase in operating earnings and supported by our share buyback activity. Operating's earnings growth was driven by both revenue growth and margin improvement.","On Slide 2, you can see that our full year operating margin improved from 39.3% in 2010 to 39.7% in 2011, and this margin improvement despite again the market environment. Our compensation-to-revenue ratio of 34.7% was consistent with 2010, which was 34.8% and, really, the range we've been running in for the last several years of 35%. So nothing's changed there.","Slide 3 shows the extent of market volatility in the fourth quarter. Given the majority of our equity assets priced daily and focusing on average rather than period-end markets. U.S. markets fared relatively well, ending the year with a strong recovery. But world markets, emerging markets, energy and mining fared poorly, driven in part by European uncertainties. Compared to prior periods, world markets were down around 5%, and emerging markets were down in the double digits. Volatility and global market declines affected investor sentiment. And since about half of our equity AUM is tied to non-U.S. markets, this obviously impacted our revenues. ","We generated business that buffered some of these market effects, as we saw net new business, clients-favored index, EPS and multi-asset products in the face of this uncertainty. These products saw inflows and was otherwise, generally, a negative flow environment.","I'm now going to walk through a comparison of fourth quarter results compared to a year ago then discuss our results compared to the prior quarter. On Slide 5, you can see that earnings per share of $3.06 included $3.14 of operating earnings and $0.08 of nonoperating expense. EPS was negatively impacted by lower performance fees but benefited from our share repurchase program. While we recorded positive marks on our investment portfolio, the marks were just not as positive as a year ago. The fourth quarter as-adjusted tax rate was 32%. We've been running in this area for the last few quarters. All things being equal, I think this is a reasonable rate to think about as we enter 2012.","Moving to Slide 6. Year-over-year operating earnings of $841 million reflected revenue diversity, organic growth and expense controls, partially offsetting the market-related effects on revenues.","Slide 7, you can see how our business model benefits from diverse revenue sources. Fourth quarter revenues were $2.2 billion. This includes $1.9 billion of base fees, $147 million of performance fees and a record $149 million of BRS revenues. In the fourth quarter, we generated $364 million of revenue. That's 16% of the total from sources other than base fees. In 2011, we benefited from increases in revenue across numerous sources. That included full year $72 million increase in sec lending revenue, that's a 22% year-over-year increase, and a $50 million increase in BRS revenues, an 11% year-over-year increase. So you can see we have components of revenues growing at double-digit rates. ","Almost 60% of our hedge funds outperformed the relative HFRI indices over the past 12 months. Despite that fact, fourth quarter performance fees of $147 million were down $179 million compared to a year ago. As with many hedge funds across the industry, several of our own hedge funds ended the year below high watermarks. Our performance varies by fund. But as we begin 2012, the gap to high watermarks for the fund that had been our most material performance fee drivers are only below high watermarks in the low single digits. So while performance was down, this feels much different and much better than 2008. At the same time, we continue to benefit from strong performance under traditional products, where we generated $100 million of performance fees in the quarter.","As I mentioned, BlackRock Solutions and Advisory revenues reached a record high for the quarter of $149 million, as well as a full year record high. Growth continued in our core Aladdin business as clients sought out sophisticated tools to manage risk in the face of volatility. The revenues also reflect the completion of a major advisory assignment in the fourth quarter. ","On a full year basis, nearly 80% of the growth in BRS revenues came from ongoing Aladdin assignments, which will continue to benefit the revenue base in 2012 and beyond because these are very long-lived relationships. Much of the growth came from international clients, and that's transforming BRS from a predominantly U.S. business to one which is truly global.","Fourth quarter base fees of $1.9 billion, as you can see on Slide 8, are down $88 million from 2010. This primarily reflects the volatile and negative world equity markets. The decline in our equity-related revenues was offset partially by flight of new business into ETFs and other index products, as well as the flows into multi-asset class products. The diversity of our long-dated offerings across active and passive products serving multiple client types and multiple regions is one of our key strengths that helps us maintain strong revenues relative to the challenging external environment. Compared to a year ago, we also saw the revenue effect of the exit from low-yielding cash products, so we did see some reversal of that trend with clients coming back into cash products in the fourth quarter.","Turning now to Slide 9. You can see that our expense controls contributed to a 9% decrease in as-adjusted expenses, which totaled $1.4 billion, as well as contributed to our strong margin. We recorded a $32 million onetime charge in the fourth quarter related to several restructuring opportunities that will benefit us beginning next year. These opportunities were associated primarily with the continued integration of iShares, on more global and integrated approach to marketing and additional efficiencies in technology and operations associated with further progress towards a single global operating platform. We excluded this charge from as-adjusted results. ","At the same time, we continue to invest in our business. We added net over 900 people to the firm in 2011. Just last week, we announced the acquisition of a Canadian ETF platform and we continue our commitment to our brand. These are all things Larry's going to talk more about. These are important investments for the long term.","Moving on to sequential quarter results. Operating results were relatively stable, which I know everyone really focuses on how we're doing sequentially, while nonoperating results benefited from the favorable movements in markets right at the end of the year. ","On Slide 11, you can see sequentially EPS improved by $0.23. That included $0.21 associated with improved marks on our co- and seed investments, and I'll talk a little bit more about nonoperating in a minute. Stable operating income of $841 million, seen on Slide 12, was supported by stability in revenues and stability in expenses.","Moving to Slide 13. A $56 million increase in performance fees and a $32 million increase in BRS revenues were offset by market-related decreases in base fees, which you can see on Slide 14. The pressure on base fees related to the effect of unfavorable markets on equity and AUM which overwhelmed what was really a good quarter for strong net new business.","As I mentioned earlier, we've continued our expense discipline. As you can see on Slide 15, expenses were stable across most categories. Expenses did include in the quarter $8 million of fund launch costs associated with the $300 million closed-end fund investing in utilities and infrastructure. I think a good example of the type of income-oriented products we're trying to offer our clients.","Slide 17 shows nonoperating expense of $21 million, which included $18 million of positive marks, primarily on our co-investments and private equity. On a full year basis, our marks were positive $26 million, and net interest expense for the quarter has been stable. The value of the investment portfolio was up about 10% this quarter, closed the year at about $1.2 billion or $1.1 billion when you exclude investments that represent hedges or which were hedged. The growth relative to prior quarter related primarily to the seeding of several new retail alternative products, all of them we think important opportunities for our clients. ","And just to give you the examples, there was a Long\/Short Credit Fund, a commodity fund and a Renminbi Bond Fund. As a reminder, we've got no proprietary investments. We invest alongside our clients. We see new product as required for the base business. Our investments are aligned with the interest of our clients. Really, when you think of our whole business model, our revenues and business are predicated on acting as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients, and we receive a fee for providing those services. So we're not a balance sheet company. In fact, when we look at our entire balance sheet, it is really small. We have less than $8 billion of economic tangible assets on the balance sheet. And when you look at where these are, it's cash of over $3 billion, $2 billion of receivables and $1 billion portfolio we just talked about.","Moving to Slide 18. Our operating cash flow was about $2.7 billion last year, up about $100 million from 2010. And as I mentioned previously, we continued our share repurchase of 618,000 shares in the fourth quarter. Our full year payout ratio was 48%, and that included both our dividend and a core repurchase. When you include our repurchase of Bank of America's ownership stake, our payout ratio was 157%. We still have 3.6 million shares remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that our cash flow generation allows us ample opportunity to reward shareholders consistently. ","So to sum up, despite volatile markets, we delivered a healthy margin, generated substantial cash flow and returned a large amount of cash to shareholders. Looking ahead, we are extremely excited about the opportunities we have to work with our clients in 2012 and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue helping them navigate this challenging environment. We've entered the year more confident than ever in our business model and are intensely focused on executing the growth opportunities we see across our business. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry who will discuss the market environment, what we're seeing with our clients and the ideas and products that can help them navigate the current markets.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Ann Marie. Happy new year to everyone. I'm going to have a little more exhaustive review of the world today, and I'll try to put that in the context of BlackRock, and try to describe from our vantage point what our clients are seeing and what type of questions they're asking us. ","Let me just review really quickly 2011, which I think, by any course of the imagination, was a challenging market environment for a lot of people. We have the sovereign credit crisis in Europe, destabilization of the Middle East, continue economic uncertainty worldwide, renewed economic uncertainty in the emerging market area, a lot of tragedy in Japan with the tsunami and the earthquake, and the United States politically disappointing us in terms of the deficit ceilings and the persistent problems of unemployment in the United States, a persistent problem in housing in the United States and, by any long-term measure, muted growth. ","Unfortunately for 2012, it's not going to get that much better economically, and yet, I'm quite bullish as I was in 2011 on the direction of the global equity markets. But 2012 will represent a continuation of volatility. We have a very important election in France. I don't think the market appreciates the importance of that election. From my vantage point, if Sarkozy does lose an election, it would move, obviously, France more to the left. And I don't -- I have a hard time understanding the union between France and Germany in that circumstance. And so I think we have more political uncertainty in Europe than we normally do, on top of all this economic uncertainty. We, obviously, in our country in the United States, we have another election, which is going to lead to a lot of political gridlock and greater uncertainty. We have leadership changes in the latter part of this year in China, which could lead to different policy changes. We have threats from Iran, continued unrest in the Middle East and continued sovereign debt crisis in Europe. We will persistently have a muted housing market. I still think it's going to have another 2 years to truly stabilize housing in America. We continue to have unsustainable level of deficits in this country and we continue to have muted growth. ","So markets are going to be influenced a lot by these events, driven by government and politics. Yet at the same time, balance sheets are improving worldwide. Corporations in the United States, in many cases, in Europe have never been stronger. Cash balances have never been bigger, and the amount of de-risking that has been done worldwide leads me to have a -- despite all this uncertainty, a more positive overview. And one of the big challenges for all investors worldwide is to stop looking at the blogs, the immediacy of news and focus on long-term challenges and how to manage your long-term liabilities over those long-term challenges. This is not being done as much as they should be. This is why we've seen such a de-risking. But it is my belief for those investors who have the ability to overcome the challenges of the short-term news events and start focusing on their own internal challenges and their own internal liabilities and try to design portfolios and returns that will navigate higher returns over 5- and 10-year cycles. Those investors are going to be benefited much more than those who are continue focusing on the immediacy of the moment. ","And so I believe, overall, we are going to have a positive trending market over the course of 2012, and yet, there's going to be a lot of volatility within that time. It is very -- it is not surprising to me watching how Europe has stabilized, at the same time, that you're the ECB do their own form of quantitative easing and they could do that through a 3-year term debt repo, which is giving a lot of purchasing power, not unlike what happened in the United States when our Federal Reserve did the quantitative easing. So you're starting to see aggressive auctions now in sovereign credits in Europe. Let's hope those continue. But this is as a result of the ECB actions. And I don't believe the ECB has been given enough credit for their actions. Mario Draghi also has one more major tool in his toolkit that our Federal Reserve does not have. A short-term rates in Europe were 1%, so there's a great opportunity, if necessary, to lower rates also in Europe to producing more steep yield curve, which will invent -- ultimately create better opportunities in buying longer-term credit. So I think we're going to have this mix and match going forward in 2012, but I have, like I did in 2011, a bias towards focusing on long-term investing.","These challenges, though, really create real difficulties for a lot of our investors, and I'm pleased to say BlackRock is well positioned to work with our clients. And I'm not just talking about institutional clients. And I'm not talking about just U.S. clients, but global institutional clients. Our retail clients are all looking for advice. Most investors -- pension funds are looking for returns of 7-plus percent. Very hard to achieve that when you own bonds that are yielding 2%. And so the dialogues we need to have with our investors are very different than the dialogues we had 5 and 7 and 10 years ago when you had significant opportunities in yield and bonds to make those type of returns. Dialogues today require talking about many more aspects of investing today, and no firm in the world is as well positioned to have that more complete dialogue talking to our investors' challenges. ","Earlier or late last year, we did have an institutional conference with our clients, and the theme of the client -- of the conference was investors are no longer have the ability to find low-hanging fruit, but they're going to have to spend more time in finding that high-hanging fruit. And I think that's going to be the theme for 2012.","The other big issue, and no one else has this platform, clients have to spend more time focusing on their own specific solutions. And I -- the way we are positioned -- and I'm going to talk about some of the major theme for 2012, how we're positioning to help our clients into solutions, but I just need to also, as I do every time we talk about it, is the overlay of what our BlackRock Solutions risk management Aladdin platform allows us to do in navigating these types of solution-based conversations with our clients. ","So if I had to just reflect on the fourth quarter, as we think about now going into 2012, the diversity of our business model has substantially dampened the impact of volatile markets. Ann Marie spoke about the growth of solutions, the beta products versus alpha products, and I'm going to go into more granular detail about the Defined Contribution about multi-asset strategies. But it's the diversity of products that is allowing us to have more complex conversation with clients, more stable earnings and a more powerful future, especially in this low-rate environment that I don't believe people truly understand the impact on many asset managers, the impact on our clients of this persistence low-rate environment. ","So let me talk about our growth areas for 2012 in these uncertain markets that I just discussed. Also, I have to overlay not just this uncertain market as we enter 2012. We are going to have a persistent issue related to the aging populations worldwide and the need for better retirement solutions. It's interesting for me to watch the global dialogue of the U.S. and the Europe about deficits. And yet, there's such a small dialogue about retirement. It is my opinion the retirement crisis or the lack of monies necessary to meet our aging population and our -- and a population worldwide that's going to live longer, the biggest crisis is not just going to be a sovereign credit crisis, but the biggest crisis we're going to face in the coming years is a retirement crisis, the -- having the appropriateness of money to live the lifestyle that you're accustomed to during your retirement ages. This is not being discussed. This is a severe issue, and the persistence of low rate aggravates the problem much greater. ","So with those ideas, I wanted to talk about where we believe, for BlackRock, are 5 key opportunities for making, obviously, our clients in a better position, but in doing so obviously, making BlackRock a better stock to own. Part one, we do believe very strongly as people start looking at risk budgeting, the use of indexing in ETFs becomes a larger component of your framework, and we are very much a part of that dialogue. Despite some negative flows in alpha products, which was industry-wide, we benefited as a firm because of our strong position in the beta products, both in the index funds and the ETF products. We believe this will carry on. ","And when you think about risk budgeting, we believe -- and we just started seeing a trend. We're going to see more and more investors move out of active types of strategies and some -- in some, not all, fixed income strategies to go into more indexing. We believe they're going to see, as a result of it, more of a barbelling a lot of investors in fixed income and go into the high-yield area, maybe the bank loan area. There's great opportunities in other product like munis. They're obviously going to go into emerging market debt. ","But in terms of treasuries and maybe mortgages, you're going to see a lot more need for -- in the risk budgeting component, indexation or ETFs. And then you're going to allow these institutions to start thinking about taking greater alpha risk in other product, whether it is high yield or any other types of yielding product. And it may mean a greater allocation, which really, the first time in many years, impacted the equities in the form of dividend stocks and other things like that. But our first position is indexing and ETFs. ","Our second area of growth for 2012 and beyond, as we have been investing aggressively, as Ann Marie spoke about, and that is alternatives. Where we believe clients are going to use indexing or ETFs on one side of the barbell, and they're going to be more aggressive in terms of alternatives. We expect the alternative paydays to start coming out as we build -- are building more and more teams, and we will continue to build out more and more products and teams in the various alternative space. We are in the markets right now in a -- in many types of products, whether it's alternative energy, private equity and other forms of alternatives space. We are in the market of raising money right now. ","But I will also say, we see great opportunities in many alpha products at BlackRock. We had outflows in our scientific active equity area last year, but our performance was great. The dialogue with our clients is beginning to have a turnaround, and we think we will see, by the end of 2012, inflows into this product. As I mentioned early before, we are continuing to have great dialogue about high yield. Emerging market debt, today we won a very important assignment today, about $350 million in emerging market debt fund. So we are starting to see clients start navigating and not just in alternatives, but in other types of, what I would call, higher alpha opportunity long-holding products. ","We are seeing clients focus on model-driven fixed income. We are seeing clients saying, after a lot of negative noise earlier last year, the clients who entered the muni market last year had some of the great returns of anyone as we witnessed state and local governments navigating down their deficit issues and becoming a little more responsible. And the muni market responded very, very nicely on that. So we are seeing not just opportunities in the beta product, but in also the specialized alpha products, which leads me to our multi-asset strategy solution. ","More and more clients are looking for more of a fiduciary relationship with firms like BlackRock. Other firms are participating very nicely in this. But clients are coming to us for a more -- they're looking for a more complete solutions. They're looking for a more complex, more comprehensive relationship with us, and most importantly, they're looking for a deeper dialogue. And in the fourth quarter, when I go over some of the highlights of some of the wins, this is an area that we're continuing to see growth. We're continuing to add more employees in this area and building a broader depth of people.","The third area -- excuse me, the fourth area is retirement and income. As I said, I can't think of a more important area that we all have to focus on. This is not just a U.S. phenomenon. This is going to be a worldwide phenomenon. Aging population worldwide is creating much greater need for better retirement solutions. And I think at BlackRock, we are trying to navigate products into these solutions. We're showing up more and more of the Defined Contribution business, where we added $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter net new business or -- and we added $31 billion of net new assets in our DC business for the year, which represented, for us, about a 10% organic growth area in this area. And as I think I said in other quarterly report -- earnings, there's only less than a dozen firms that are in this area of defined contribution. And so we're seeing seismic changes in the asset management business. The Defined Contribution, movement out of defined benefit, and the Defined Contribution is a very good example of that. Obviously, the movement out of active into indexing is another good example. The utilization of ETFs is another good example. ","So fifth area that we're focusing as the theme for 2012 is income. Investors worldwide have to rethink about income. In this low-rate, volatile environment, clients are looking for more products that can provide, obviously, less volatility in pure equities. But their -- but they can't afford to own bonds yielding 2%. And so they are looking for solutions that, as I discussed before, that may have high-yield elements to it. It may have preferred stock, preferred bond elements to it. And most importantly, it's going to be heavily oriented towards dividend stocks that have lower beta tracking than the normal equity markets. But once again, to have a dialogue with our client about these products, have -- showing how these types of products can have lowing track -- lower beta than the market but higher return than bonds, requires a comprehensive dialogue with our clients. ","Let me just overlay all that, as I said earlier, which differentiates us in that BlackRock Solutions, which clearly had an exceptional year and quarter. The momentum into 2012 continues. As Ann Marie spoke about it, this was predominantly a U.S. business that is becoming a very global business for us. This year, we expanded, as I said, in Europe and Asia. We added 2 more Aladdin clients in Japan. We saw a huge increase in our advisory relationships and assignments in Europe to work with governments and financial institutions navigate their circumstances. And we reached now -- in terms of the Aladdin system utilization, we now have $10.2 trillion onto our risk analytic platform that we help clients in navigating risk. Our pipeline for Aladdin implementation has never been stronger. We are only weakened in that platform because of the utilization of people and time, and I believe 2012 will be even more robust for us than 2011. ","Before I go into some specific details, I also have to just say, our #1 responsibility is producing returns. And that's true for tracking error in our beta products, where we exhibited some very weak tracking error in one of our products in 2010. We turned that around, and we had very positive flows in our emerging market ETF product. We have to have a very strong alpha, where I would say, in 2011, some of our products underperformed. Some of our products did very well. But overall, we did well. I am not happy with where we are. I wanted to be even better than well in terms of the alpha products. We know our clients are not just hiring us for advice. They're hiring us for performance, and every client and every employee understands that.","In 2011, to build this momentum, we're continuing to invest in our people and our brand. Going into 2012, we are going to build our brand awareness worldwide, it'll be a major strategic effort for us. And as Ann Marie discussed as a statement of growth, we added close to 900 people worldwide as we continue to build out our platform. ","One other thing I wanted to just talk about the returning of value to our shareholders. Obviously, 2011, we did quite a bit of that. It is my expectation that we are going to continue to use an enormous large free cash flow, combination of dividends, stock repurchases, and a little later, I'll talk about some possible M&A opportunities. ","Let me go into the details of the different products really quickly and then we'll open up for questions, because I know a lot of you are going to jump off but then get on to the other institutions who had calls today. ","Overall, in the ETF market, our iShares product really picked up momentum from, I would say, a slow start in the first quarter to a very strong finish. I am very pleased to say that our flows into 2012 continue to be quite aggressive where we already, year-to-date, and our ETF products have close to $4.4 billion in new flows into our products. For the year, last year, we had about $53 billion of flows, and it really picked up a lot of the momentum in the fourth quarter. I am pleased to say that we recaptured the #1 share in net flows in the United States, where, as I said earlier in the year, we really did not do as well as we expected. I think I said in our last third quarter report that I expected much more from our team and we are starting to see that. And we continue to have a large international dominance in our ETF platform worldwide. ","We continue to try to build that dominance, as Ann Marie announced -- noted, that we did buy Claymore Securities, an ETF platform in Canada. And why that was important for us because we have a huge market in Canada right now, and we're very happy with our position in Canada. Our presence in Canada was predominantly institutional. Claymore has a very strong retail presence where we did not have that type of strong presence. They had some very strong products like the Canadian dollar gold fund, very simplistic products. And it's those simplistic products are the best, so I don't mean that in any negative way. I mean that in a very positive way. And so it really fit very nicely into our product mix and our client profile mix. And so we look forward to doing that. And I do believe, just as a footnote, there are going to be many more opportunities for us to fill in our ETF presence worldwide if these -- if and when other companies come up for sale. ","On the retail side, I'm particularly pleased with our North American results in 2011, and I think we're in a very good position for 2012. As I discussed earlier, we picked up market share in U.S. retail. There were huge outflows in the U.S. mutual fund business at ETFs, and we had inflows. I unfortunately believe you're going to continue to see outflows in traditional mutual funds in the United States, as clients are trying to diversify and look for different products, but this trend is not going to be arrested any time soon in the industry. And I do believe BlackRock will continue to pick net market share. As I said over the last few years, this is a big priority for us to continue to build out our presence in the U.S. mutual fund business. When I spoke about one of our priorities in 2012, to continue to build our brand and put a big effort, we believe it's really important for us as we build out our presence in U.S. and international retail, that our brand presence has to be a much stronger result. ","In international retail, however, we had outflows, like the industry, and it's a function of the massive de-risking that is going on in Europe. We're sitting here thinking about how difficult Europe is. Imagine if you're sitting there with your pension fund, sitting in some form of a long-term investment, many people have capitulated and frozen, and the whole industry have seen, most recently, outflows in the international retail. And most of this money just sitting in cash, and so it's not this -- it's not like this money is running away and permanently gone. It's -- people are looking for greater stability to get back into the marketplace. At the moment, though, I don't see a turnaround in any short period of time in international retail for an industry. It's -- it will continue to have, I want to call, mediocre flows until we see a more stability in the continent. ","Institutionally, same idea. As we have all this uncertainty and the persistence of low rates, we're seeing more and more institutions de-risk, and they de-risk in the form of moving from active to passive. Fortunately, our business model allows us to take advantage of that, and I believe we are going to continue to take advantage of that. It is our hope, as we continue to build out our alternative products, we will continue to benefit from that, and we will see that. So in the fourth quarter, in our -- in institutional, we did have positive flows in our index products. And I must say, we are continuing to see clients seeking probably more passive strategies on the institutional side. ","I do believe, like we've seen in many other years, this reminds me of the first quarter of '09 when we discussed to all of you at the end of what happened with '08, how clients capitulated, clients paused, clients looked for advice. And then starting the second and third quarter, we started to see clients doing much more active strategies. I do believe that will be the same process. And I can't tell you the types of conversations we have with our investors now in the first quarter are much more dynamic than we had last year, and clients are looking for the solution-based relationships. ","So I'm very pleased about how we are being positioned, but I don't want to say that we are seeing a massive turnaround in that -- in behavior from the fourth quarter into the first quarter. But this is the time pension funds, retirement funds, endowments, insurance company ask themselves how are they going to position themselves in the future. They will be going to their respective boards and talking about strategies, risk budgeting, and that's where we're having a dialogue. And I believe we're playing a bigger role in helping our clients play that role. So I am looking here to be the -- I look to the same themes that we saw in '09 on the institutional side. ","Let me just talk -- touch on a few things, and it's getting time for open up there for questions. As I said earlier, our Defined Contribution business continues to be strong with about $6 billion -- over $6 billion of inflows in the quarter. Our multi-asset strategy, once again, the solution-based stuff that I'm talking about, we have $3.2 billion of net new business, and clients are looking for more customized solutions. ","One of the good creative products we created last year, and I think I mentioned it in the third quarter, and this is a product that we did a wrapper using annuity products in some of our glidepath products with Met Life. We launched this product in May, and we continue to generate strong inflows. This is something that we budgeted, about $1 billion product. We are now at $2.4 billion in size, of which $1.1 billion was raised in the fourth quarter alone. So when you're innovative, when you've designed products that fit the clients' needs, we see the benefits.","In terms of alternatives, we had outflows in a product that was more currency and commodity based, and that -- we're going to see big inflows and outflows that was more currency-overlay type of product. And -- but we continue to have more dialogue that -- with more investors worldwide in our alternative products. Ann Marie talked about some of the performance stuff that we've ever had before. And we believe we're going to see real inflows in 2012 if we use 2011 as a year to really building these products. ","In cash, we've seen -- in the fourth quarter, we saw inflows for the first time in, I think, 6 quarters, and we'll see where the cash management business goes in this low-rate environment. But the one thing I could say related to the cash management that's somewhat connected, that's in security lending. That produced some very good returns for us and our clients in 2012 (sic) [2011], especially in the fourth quarter. We're seeing more hedge funds looking to utilize stocks again, especially in the fourth quarter. And so if I could talk about cash management and sec lending, that was a very big pleasant surprise for us, and we continue to see utilization rates going up. And there is a -- despite how low rates are, there's a steep yield curve between 1-day and 90-day money. And so that's been helpful. ","On the BlackRock Advisory business, where we are advising money for large clients, some are very well-known clients, we continue to be -- and I am pleased to say, we're continuing to liquidate these -- some of these portfolios, as our clients are achieving the objectives they needed to achieve in terms of giving us these advisory assignments as -- and now, they're starting to wind these down. So we're going to continue to see that side of our AUM going down. As you know, this is a -- just a very, very low fee basis. We were very pleased with the role that we have played in some of these large-scale public advisory assignments. And I do believe when there's a need for us to play those roles, we will be back playing those roles again. ","Let me just touch on 2 other things, and that's the M&A environment. I have never seen a more asymmetric market, massive sellers in the asset management business. Obviously, the trends are very hostile for a lot of asset managers, and two, you're seeing, because of Basel III and capital needs, many institutions that are affiliated with financial institutions are -- that are looking to decouple their asset management businesses. As I said in the third quarter and I'll say it again, we are not looking at any large platform purchase at all worldwide. There's rumors that we are involved in some large-scale platforms. I will deny that now. We are not. But we are very active in looking at fill-in products. We see some very unique opportunities now, and we are very excited about the opportunities we will have in terms of fill-in products, either in product or a fill in, in country. And we are in the presence of some active dialogues right now, but they're not these large-scale platforms. We do not believe those will be fitting for BlackRock, and so I'll leave it at that related to M&A. ","The regulatory environment will be upon us sometime this year. We still have -- this is very fluid. This will impact all of us in financial institutional land. It will have an impact on our clients. It will have an impact on BlackRock and other things. So we will see how all this plays out. We are very excited about the CFTC announcement and vote last week. This is a great example, whereby a regulator did the right thing for investors and assurance that we're going to have segregation of our collateral. So when people talk about regulation, some regulation is good for all of us. And I will be -- we will be very out-front in regulation, making sure that in the regulation, as it's being formulated, that it's good for our investors. And we will be vocal when it is. And so there are regulation that everyone should be proud of, that we are building a sounder, safer financial community. There is some regulation, though, I'm not going to get into that I'm worried about, that could have an impact on cost of doing business. And we will quietly discuss that with the regulators in how to minimize those costs to our clients. ","Overall, I would say 2011 was a good year. I'm very, very bullish on our positioning for 2012. I don't believe we have ever been in a position to take advantage of our business platform, in dealing with clients, in navigating these troubled marketplaces to give us even a larger presence, a larger opportunity and, obviously, great growth opportunities for earnings for all of us, for all of our shareholders. ","Let me open it for questions, and let me wish everyone a very healthy 2012.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I think the one thing you didn't really talk about much in your prepared remarks was the pipeline this quarter, which I think now for the second quarter in a row has declined. So hoping that you could give us a little bit more detail on the sales cycle and what else contributed to that. Obviously, there were some passive inflows this quarter. Maybe even touch a little bit upon what the mix is in terms of the business that you're seeing that could come online.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I did not purposely talk about the pipeline, not that I'm trying to hide it. I'm trying to deemphasize it. As our business becomes more and more -- with more and more flows in retail, when we talk about pipeline, it was -- A, it was only institutional. It was -- because we have no pipeline retail. It's -- and so we're trying to deemphasize how one thinks about it. Two, in the pipeline, there is a lot of noise related to indexing, which confuses people. And so we have -- we purposely did not discuss it. We are still seeing, as I said in my prepared remarks, a great deal of interest in index types of products. We are in more dialogue with more clients, as I said, institutionally right now for strategies, but there's nothing translating into a pipeline yet. But -- so the pipeline is about $50-odd billion, and then you have this one outflow that we telegraphed in the third quarter, which a client is insourcing a bunch of indexing product. But I don't think our pipeline, by the way, is any different in terms of the feel, in terms of the flows, ins and outs than it is any other times. It's just what we are witnessing now, the pipeline is a very noisy statistic. And so that's why I did not discuss it in my prepared remarks. But I don't -- but we are not seeing any real massive change in the flow or the style. But we're seeing it in the mix, as you suggested. We continue to see more interest temporarily in index-like products. I talked about the $4.5 billion of flows in our -- in iShares year-to-date. I talked about we just won a $350 million flow in emerging fixed income today. So we're seeing a large breadth of inflows. We've actually have a great pipeline in alternatives, but obviously, it's a sheer number, that's quite small. And so I don't think there's much tonality difference, Alex, than other quarters. It's just noisier because of the ins and outs of index business.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just real quick. One of the things that you highlighted for this year was the whole defined retirement opportunity. Now there's some regulatory changes coming up on the DC side. I know you're not a big DC player in terms of record keeping or anything like that, but are there opportunities for you to capitalize in that? Or do you think it's going to be a non-event that is really going to go...","Laurence Douglas Fink","We're not a record keeper. So we don't do that. We continue to pick up large -- I would say, we're benefiting from the consolidation of ETF -- excuse me, DC players. And related to the regulatory issues you discussed, because we're investment only, it's a big advantage for us. We're -- because we're investment only, because we are -- we only manufacture and we don't compete with our distribution partners, we have advantages of working with many distribution platforms, and that has allowed us to continue to have, what I would say, double-digit growth rates for DC, which we think we will continue to do this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess in terms of your capital, if you could maybe talk about what a targeted payout ratio between the dividends and buybacks, and then obviously, bucketing in the talk around the fill-in products or potential acquisitions.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm going to let Ann Marie talk about it for a second. But hey, let me just talk about dividend policy as I think about it. I don't -- I think a dividend policy should hover between 40% and 50% payout ratio. I've said this for the last few years. We are not changing that. Depending on what we see in M&A opportunities or what we design the relative ability to buy stock back, we will navigate in that range. But we will continue to be active in stock repurchases. We continue to have growing cash flow, and I will continue to say I hate having a large balance sheet. I do not want to ever -- we will never compete with our clients. And so the best thing for our investors is having a very active constructive process of using our free cash flow for dividend, for stock repurchase. And if we see unique opportunities on the M&A side, we will do it that way. I will not buy a company if I think stock repurchase is so much more superior. Obviously, we are a revenue-growth story. So we're going to look for opportunities, and hopefully, we can find opportunities in companies where it is revenue positive and accretive at the same time. And that's what we're going to continue to do. And so, Ann Marie, do you have any other commentary on this?","Ann Marie Petach","No, I think that's really covered it.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess the follow-up on, in terms of the headcount reductions that we're talking about for the fourth quarter, and then I think there's also some commentary about ongoing focus to lower cost regions. I mean, how should we think about that with regards to 2012 expenses and potential margins?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, we have nothing -- we're -- the downsizing was done last year with the purpose of making sure we go into 2012 straight on. We have nothing in the plans in terms of any types of headcount reduction, in terms of expenses. We are navigating our expenses very aggressively. We are -- we still have growth opportunities. We will still have some headcount growth in 2012. And one should assume, as I said in other quarters, is our intention, and this is subject to markets and opportunities, we want to have margins above 40%, but it's going to be a balance over -- versus all these other issues. And maybe off-line, Ann Marie could give you more color, or Patrick and team, in terms of how we look at that.","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. I would just say, one important thing is we're going to always reallocate resources where we think they're most important for our clients and where we've got the greatest growth opportunities and, likewise, adjust our expenses on that. So part of 2012 was really positioning ourselves to take advantage of the right opportunities in 2012 for us and our clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Larry, I'm sort of curious. I mean, you sort of talked about the low-rate backdrop and sort of the barbell on a couple of different businesses and sort of the trends overall, both U.S. and non-U.S. When you --  and you mentioned earlier about sort of the share erosion for U.S. to each of mutual fund companies. What do you think happens with the economics of the business? I mean, will there be a sort of a collective reaction, at some point in time, to try and stunt some of the growth in the ETF business? Or how do you sort of see the pricing element of the business?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, I would still say the majority -- 75% of ETF growth is not cannibalizing mutual funds. I still think most of it is cannibalizing stock purchases. It's still a very institutional product, where it, as I said, cannibalizes stock purchases. I think the biggest culprit of mutual fund outflows into -- in the U.S. was underperformance and just overall de-risking. So I'm not -- but there's no question, there's going to have to be some form of reckoning with the mutual fund industry if there's a persistent underperformance to really rebuild confidence with those managers. One should expect lower fees of some sort, because unquestionably, whether people believe me or not where ETF flows are being generated from, there is a perception that ETF flows are cannibalizing active equity management. And so the knee-jerk reaction for some people may be we're going to have to stop that and maybe you're going to see industry trend to lower fees. I will tell you, mutual fund boards are going to have to start asking those types of questions across all the different complexes.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. The second question is, and maybe you sort of talked about it in your comments about sort of dealing with the regulators behind the scenes. But you didn't really discuss the money market reform. Sort of curious where your thoughts are today, and what you think the most likely outcome will be for the industry given some of the dialogue between floating rate and NAV, capital buffers and redemption restrictions, if you will.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I think it's really fluid. We've had conversation with different regulators, and I don't think there's a consistent view from all the different regulators at the moment. But there is a consistent view that there must be some change. So I don't want to -- I think every regulator says we need to find ways to stabilize society from the risk of money market funds, and we can't have the same risks that we exhibited in 2008. How you implement, whether as you suggested variable NAV or capital or some form of restrictions, each, I would say there are biases by the different regulators. So I don't know where it's going to come out. We have been a strong advocate of having capital put aside for it. We believe we don't -- we believe no different than the Basel standards, whereby you have multi-years to build your capital standard. From our vantage point, the regulators should have allow managers to build capital associated with the money market fund business over many years, maybe reserving a component of the fees to build that capital buffer. I think it'll make the money market fund industry a stronger one. And so we have been, for 2, 3 years, a strong advocate of that. As you know, at this moment, FASB does not allow us to retain any of our fees for a capital buffer. So it is -- right now, under accounting standards, we can't do that. So we need changes in not only regulatory, but we need changes in accounting to get that done. And we have been fighting our -- this is one of the issues that I've always had with the accounting standard board related to why can't we have capital buffers. But we have not been permitted. So we'll see, Bill. I don't -- I really don't have a final view, but we are advocating for change.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Hopson with Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So as you pointed out, the iShares market share stabilized in the fourth quarter, are you thinking that this is sustainable from here? And then in terms of seasonality, fourth quarter stronger, typically first quarter weaker, obviously, you're not necessarily seeing that. But any thoughts on that potential trend?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Our weakness in the latter part of 2010 and the early part of 2011 in terms of our flows in our North American ETF platform, a lot of it was self-inflicted, as I said. We had -- our largest outflow product was our emerging market ETF product. And we -- I think by the second quarter of last year, we stabilized it, and we actually have had very, very good positive tracking. And we saw $4 billion of positive inflows in that fund as a result of that. Once again, it validates our view that tracking is a very important component how people look at ETFs, and our experience of that really validated that. And so this is why we are so forceful in terms of making sure we perform in terms of what the indexes that we're going to perform as the index or in many cases, hopefully, outperform. But I do believe we will continue to have a strong position in the industry going forward. So I do like our position in the industry. I continue to believe we have great opportunities there, both in North America and in Europe. So whether it's sustainable, I would -- my bias would say yes. But it's a function of the whims of the marketplace. Clearly, if there's a view that everyone's going to be re-risking, you may see more flows in the QQQs or the -- or more flows into a S&P product. So you -- if you -- it really depends on where the market is. And if we are the strongest, most liquid product in those areas, a positive side about how we're positioned, we have more breadth than any other ETF player in the market. I would say one last thing that I should have said. I do believe, despite my views, I do -- we are still seeing great evidence that many people are putting more and more money into bond ETFs, and we are benefiting from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kelly with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Larry, you mentioned that you have strong dialogue in the alternative space. So just curious, which clients are -- you're having the most discussions with and how diverse the strategies are looking for and when you think that could actually start to take hold.","Laurence Douglas Fink","We're having, as I said, more dialogue than ever before. We actually have a lot of pipeline of small little wins. We've had a couple of number of wins so far this year. We are in some finals of some very large wins. We see, at the moment, interest globally, U.S. and Asia and Europe. So we are in -- I know of a number of big dialogues that we have internationally right now. We have had -- in one of our products that we're trying to wrap up a close, we have strong interest in Europe, and we are just trying to wind it up. So it's not concentrated in one region or in -- it's certainly not concentrated in one style of client.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just a little bit more color on multi-asset. So obviously, you have a big stake in that space rapidly growing. Are there any products that you're not currently offering or additional strategies that you think you can branch out into that would help you grow even faster in that space?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. I mean, look at -- we need to continue to build out our reputation in LDI, in fiduciary. These are the areas where you're seeing a lot of growth in the -- of the 2 product areas. Those are probably the 2 biggest growth areas, especially in Europe. Our view is we're going to see more fiduciary in the United States. That's one of our big bets. We've had 1 or 2 wins in the fiduciary business in the United States. We are having a lot of conversations, and we believe this is where  there are going to be some changes. It's very expensive for a lot of small pension funds to run their pension funds. And so we are in lot of quite a bit of dialogue in the fiduciary. The other 2 areas that I would say that we -- in my mind, we have a strong presence, that's the Global Allocation products where we still have a strong position, and the area which interfaces not only in multi-strategy, multi-asset but also intersects with the Defined Contribution business, and that's the target date products that is -- that has really fueled to our growth and will continue to fuel our growth in 2012.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one follow-up on the pipeline. It seems like from a conversation standpoint, you guys have been pretty active. So when you look at the environment and then maybe any seasonality, is there anything unusual when you look at the level of the pipeline versus how active you feel, meaning in terms of the conversations with clients and like the momentum going forward?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I would say -- when we talk about the barbell, I would say, if one trend is you're seeing more barbelling, you're see more indexing and more conversations on alternatives. I think this is an industry trend, and that you're seeing that in the flows, whether it is flows with us or flows with every other asset manager. Lot of people are still de-risking despite -- no one listens to me -- or not no one, but I mean, I really do believe people should be taking on risk, and I've been saying this for months. But our pipeline by asset class is generally the same, but our alternatives, we're starting to get some momentum. A lot of it is just the investments we made in 2011 in terms of having our client team focusing more alternatives and building up the alternative manufacturing platform. But it does feel like more barbelling is going on, and so it is consistent with my themes that I discussed it. I'm very -- I wish more investors started focusing on long-term strategies, because I think some of the de-risking is -- could be, long term, very harmful for the institutions, if they're focusing on the next new cycle.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe just on the -- a little bit on the regulatory side. So you guys, I think, you have the trading platform coming up sometime maybe over the next couple of months or quarters. But just when you look at the regulation, you said there's some areas that you might be concerned about. Obviously, for, at least, on the broker side or the sell side, the Volcker Rule continues to be some uncertainty around that. When you guys look at it in terms of what you can offer on the trading platform versus how that ultimately gets implemented, are there scenarios where you're concerned in terms of liquidity in the fixed income markets, and how that can impact pricing in the markets for your investors?","Laurence Douglas Fink","We've been very noisy about the Volcker Rule. We think the Volcker Rule role is not just bad for the sell side. We think it's bad for all investors. As you suggested, it's going to reduce liquidity worldwide. And I mean, when I travel overseas, I hear more and more institutions complain about the possible impact in the Volcker Rule. Without getting into any detail, let me just be very clear. We are creating this trading platform, or hope to create this trading platform, because we're frightened of the Volcker Rule and the impact of liquidity and the impact of bid-ask spreads. We are doing this only for the betterment of our clients to reduce friction cost and trading cost in doing this. If we -- when we create this, this is not meant to be a -- we're not meant to be us becoming a broker-dealer and competing with Wall Street. It's meant for us to be a better fiduciary for our clients. My greatest hope, that we don't have to do this, that the bids, the liquidity in Wall Street is greater than ever before, the bid-ask spread is tighter than ever before, and I'm spending a lot of money for nothing. Obviously, I'm spending a lot of money because I'm more -- we're more frightened about the impact of this and the impact on all of -- all investors worldwide. And as a result of it, we're creating this as a mechanism, so we could offer a better solution to our investors who invest with us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a question, maybe more for Ann Marie. But -- I guess one of the issues, unfortunately, some investors have with ETFs and betas kind of the growth -- the fee structure and maybe not giving as much focus on the higher margins there. Is there any way of getting a sense of, to the extent you guys have been very successful in improving your margins over the past year, is there any kind of analysis you've done or color you can give us on how much of that may be driven by this somewhat of a mix shift towards what may be lower fee but higher-margin products like index and ETFs or anything you can provide on that?","Ann Marie Petach","I would say it's been balanced, because we've had strong flows into all different types of indexed products, the lower fee, institutional as well as our good liquid ETFs that carry with them other benefits, liquidity and tax efficiency. So I think we don't try and digest it quite the way you've said, is it the mix of business benefiting the margin. Because we run the platform and the support to support the whole business, not just one segment. So I really feel like it's been margin improvement coming from the underlying way we're running the firm rather than the mix of business per se.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe one question for Larry. Obviously, a lot of regulatory uncertainty out there and just kind of any update you can provide on your thoughts or your -- based in your conversations with the treasury, about SIFI designation and if you think that's really not going to be much of an issue for  -- not going to be an overhang for you or the latest thoughts on that?","Laurence Douglas Fink","My latest thoughts, I know nothing more today than I did 4 months ago. I don't believe -- I think the regulators asked for a comment -- ask to comments related to asset managers and SIFI designation. I think that was delayed, if I'm correct, in terms of submitting our letter. I don't believe regulators have come to terms as to how they should think about asset managers for SIFI designation, and so I don't think there has been much movement towards that. And so we are equating to work and have a dialogue with our regulators about how they should think about all asset managers, or specifically, BlackRock, should be included or not included in the definition of SIFI regulation. So without digging myself into a deep hole, I'm going to conclude it with that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No, I think I said it all. Thank you for everyone for your time. I know it's a busy time. And thanks to all of BlackRock employees for working really hard and enduring difficult markets but coming through this quite successfully. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3344":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions).","Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry, Gary, and Rob make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results will of course or may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, let the call begin.","Gary Shedlin","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present the results for the first quarter of 2014. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results, and as usual I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","BlackRock delivered first quarter earnings per share of $4.43, up 21% compared to 2013. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 15% higher than a year ago, reflecting continued revenue growth and a decline in G&A expense.","First quarter non-operating results reflected $69 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, which were impacted by the monetization of a non-strategic opportunistic private equity investment. The first quarter as adjusted tax rate was 30% and we continue to believe this remains appropriate planning assumption for 2014.","Underpinning our results was continued organic growth despite volatile market conditions in the first quarter. We saw $27 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of approximately 3% with organic revenue growth once again outpacing organic asset growth notwithstanding the volatility which impacted our shares during the quarter. Our highly diversified multi-client platform generated more than $5 billion of net flows across each of our Retail, iShares, and Institutional businesses.","First quarter revenues were $2.7 billion, up $221 million or 9% from a year ago, and were driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees, and revenues from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes.","Base fees increased to $162 million or 8% from a year ago as average assets on our management increased as a function of organic growth, market appreciation, and the acquisitions of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses. Base fees were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter and part due to change in our AUM mix, which was impacted by relatively weaker data in markets with higher fee products and a lower day count in the first quarter.","Performance fees for the quarter increased $50 million from a year ago, primarily due to a performance fee associated with a planned final liquidation of the opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund that was partially liquidated in the fourth quarter. This fund now holds only a residual balance with limited additional performance potential.","BlackRock Solutions revenues of $154 million were up 22% year-over-year and were roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter. Our Aladdin business, which represents 71% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, was up 10% year-over-year. Sequential results were once again impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenues as we continue to onboard a number of very large clients on to the Aladdin platform.","Our Financial Markets Advisory or FMA group continues to post strong revenues. Now this quarter reflected a higher level of revenue associated with asset disposition assignments in prior quarters, the FMA group continues to develop a more institutionalized advisory model with a focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the changing regulatory environment.","Expenses for the first quarter rose $80 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increases in revenue-related items including compensation and direct fund expense, partially offset by a decline in G&A expense.","Compensation expense increased from a year ago broadly in line with growth in the overall business. As we have previously noted, the first quarter adjusted compensation to revenue ratio generally runs higher than the full year due to the seasonality of payroll taxes, which increased year-over-year due to appreciation of BlackRock's share price.","General administration expense declined $80 million year-over-year due to a number of factors, including the impact of closed-end fund launch costs in last year's first quarter, a current one-time benefit from a reverse of UK-related real estate related retirement obligation, which is no longer required to be funded and lower other expense, partially offset by foreign currency exchange movements.","Our G&A expense in the first quarter also benefited from a delay in the timing of certain expense items, including marketing and promotional spend which will be incurred throughout the remainder of 2014.","Our operating margin for the first quarter was 41.4%, 140 basis points higher than a year ago. Notwithstanding the lower level of G&A expense in the current quarter, we continue to demonstrate benefits of scale in our overall business.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by reinvesting in our business and returning excess cash to shareholders through a consistent and systematic capital management policy. As previously discussed, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.93 per share of common stock. We also repurchased an additional $250 million worth of shares during the first quarter and are committed to maintaining a steady level of repurchases during 2014.","BlackRock's financial results reflect the breadth and depth of our investment and distribution platforms. Our first quarter results reflect continued focus on key strategic themes including income, outcomes, alternative, and strategic data, as clients look to both active and passive vehicles to meet their evolving long-term investment needs.","We continue to see strong growth in global retail. Retail long-term net flows were $14 billion for the quarter, representing 11% annualized organic growth rate and were positive across all asset classes. International retail once again demonstrated strong results generating long-term net inflows of $9.8 billion representing a 25% annualized organic growth rate.","Equity flows of $4 billion were led by our top performing European equity suite, while fixed income net inflows of $2.5 billion were driven by demand for our short duration, unconstrained and high yield bond products. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.7 billion reflect the continuing momentum in our global allocation fund, a key component of our bundled outcome oriented family of products.","U.S. Retail's quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion, representing annualized organic growth of 5%, were led by fixed income's continued success in our duration managed product suite. We also saw accelerated interest across our diversified retail alternative platform with $1.5 billion of net inflows. Importantly, our global long\/short equity fund, managed by our SAE team saw accelerated flows in the quarter with each of global long\/short equity and global long\/short credit attracting more than $700 million in net new assets during the quarter.","Global iShares generated $7.8 billion of net new business in the quarter driven by fixed income flows. In the face of market volatility iShares continued to deliver the efficiency, liquidity, and performance our clients expect from the leading global ETF provider. In total, iShares equity flows for the quarter generated nearly $1 billion in net new assets, which flows into developed markets more than offsetting outflows of nearly $8 billion from EEM, our flagship for emerging markets ETF.","In recent weeks, however, we have witnessed a change in emerging market sentiment and flows have reversed with approximately $4 billion coming into EEM since quarter-end.","The global ETF industry experienced strong fixed income flows during the quarter and iShares was well-positioned to capitalize on investor demand with a diverse suite of offerings across duration and style. For the quarter, we captured the number one global market share of industry fixed income ETF flows generating approximately $6.6 billion in net new assets, including $4.6 billion from Europe.","Our institutional business generated $5 billion in net long-term inflows for the quarter. Strong passive net inflows is $17.6 billion were partially offset by active net outflows of $12.6 billion. Overall results were characterized by a number of sizeable client inflows and outflows driven by a variety of factors.","Within passive, we saw both rerisking and increased usage of Liability Driven Investing or LBI as clients rebalanced their pension plan taking advantage of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios. As markets and interest rates continue to rise, we expect to see more of this type of immunization activity. That said we also saw the redemption of single large LBI assignment in connection with the annuitization of a client's pension obligation.","Active outflows were driven by several factors including corporate events and legacy performance issues. Active fixed income flows were impacted by a single $6 billion outflow driven by the acquisition of the client by an entity affiliated with a competing asset manager. Fundamental equity flows were negatively impacted by a large subadvisor redemption, which was linked to legacy under-performance.","Finally despite continued strong overall performance we also experienced outflows of approximately $4 billion in SAE, including a significant client redemption that we were able to leverage the breadth of our platform to capture a larger passive mandate from the same client.","Larry will discuss performance in more detail but we believe that our current investment performance in both active fixed income and equities is strong and competitively well-positioned.","During the quarter, we also saw continued growth in targeted institutional sub-segments including the client contribution where we generated more than $8 billion of net inflows with particular strength coming from our LifePath, target based suite and passive equity offerings. In institutional alternatives, net inflows into hedge funded funds were offset by capital return and other liquid products. However, strong fundraising continued in illiquid alternatives with more than $1 billion in commitments raised for the fifth consecutive quarter.","Across retail and institutional clients, we saw almost $2 billion of core alternative flows during the first quarter, the highest category flows we have seen four years.","Overall, the quarter again demonstrated the consistency and stability by our diverse platform and we continue to believe that we are well-positioned for the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. While the first quarter marked the fifth straight quarterly rise for the S&P 500, equity markets experienced significant intra quarter volatility. Central Bank policy continued to be a key focus area. Global economic indicators fluctuated relative to expectations and the market attempted to digest heightened geopolitical concerns, all of which impacted asset prices.","Volatility continued in early April as valuation concerns and short-term de-risking drove the worst week for domestic equity market since 2012. And I expect this type of volatility is likely to impact markets for the remainder of the year.","The industry has seen positive mutual fund flow throughout this latest market setback. That's a good sign that long-term investors are actively engaged helping to offset hedge fund deleveraging.","In the midst of these challenges BlackRock clients' goals remain consistent focused on investing to improve their financial futures. More than ever our clients, both institutional and individuals need to think beyond the next new cycle and the next quarter to meet their long-term investment objectives.","BlackRock's focus on long-term strategic themes, like outcome-oriented investing, retirement and longevity allows us to have a differentiated conversation with our clients and to provide them with the advice they need to meet their long-term goals. Our client dialogue is enhanced by our ability to integrate technology and risk management into our investment approach and harness our collective intelligence across the entire firm.","BlackRock attracted $27 billion in long-term net new flows in the first quarter, which again reflects the diversity and breadth of our business with positive contributions coming from all client types, all asset classes, and all regions. We have more products on more buy list than ever before. The level of RFPs we're involved in and the level of client interest across our platform from active and passive and increasingly in alternatives continues to rise, and we're seeing momentum in important long-term asset classes like infrastructure where investments we've made on our platform are beginning to pay dividends. My focus and the focus of BlackRock's leadership is on capitalizing the opportunities we see to deliver the solutions our clients need.","We recognize these opportunities must start with a strong investment performance and performance is at the foundation of the BlackRock culture. We structured our business to give portfolio managers the technology, the risk management tool, and a forum of information sharing, and at the end giving them autonomy to promote the superior investment performance that our clients expect.","One significant differentiator for BlackRock is BII or the BlackRock Investment Institute. By bringing together our investment professionals to daily meetings, topical investment forums, and knowledge sharing events, BII heightened the best ideas from our top investors and shared some of the most interesting solutions with our clients. We're focused on fostering in an environment of information sharing to benefit our portfolio managers while which would ultimately enhance performance for our clients.","We are benefiting from that enhanced performance across our fixed income business where 89% of our active fixed income AUM is above benchmarker peer medium for three years. We are also seeing strong performance in many areas of alternatives, multi-asset and equities, including European and Asian equities, and we fully expect the same from our new equity teams in the U.S.","We talked at length about the work we've done to address performance issues in our U.S. equity business. This quarter, we saw $4 billion of outflows related to a legacy performance in that business primarily driven by a loss of a very large subadvisory assignment. We recognize that our fundamental equity performance was not in line with our clients' expectations; it required a significant investment and talent. We made these investments and we remain encouraged by the performance of our new teams.","Since the new teams joined BlackRock over the past two years, our U.S. basic value improved from the 51st percentile to the 7th percentile, our large cap core from the 76th percentile to the 16th percentile, and our large cap value from the 97th percentile to the 37th percentile. These are the trends that we continue to expect and through these trends we expect to see investors asking BlackRock about what we could do for them in active U.S. equities.","As we know from our experience in restructuring our active fixed income business several years ago, the process is costly and it takes time to build long-term scalable track records. The results we are seeing today in terms of fixed income performance inflows highlights the reward from successfully executing on this type of overhaul. BlackRock is committed to bring in the top-tier alpha producers and we are confident that the moves we made in our active U.S. equity business will position ourselves to achieve that goal.","Fixed income represents a meaningful opportunity for BlackRock. The fixed income ecosystem is going through significant changes. The industry is witnessing a heightened period of client interest and on all fronts BlackRock is positioned to win. The competitive landscape in fixed income is evolving, which highlights the importance of strong performance. As we start to see a shift in the performance paradigm among industry leaders BlackRock has the product and the investment performance in place to attract flows from both retail and institutional clients.","As we've discussed on prior calls, the industry has experienced a shift from traditional, long duration fixed income to more flexible, unconstrained products as clients access the risk of duration they have under portfolios. This theme drove a substantial portion of double-digit organic growth we saw in our global retail business.","International retail, we saw growing momentum in our unconstrained fixed income global opportunity fund which raised over $900 million during the quarter. And in the U.S., our flagship strategic income opportunities fund continue to generate strong investor demand with $2.7 billion of flow in the quarter.","SIO has generated $10 billion of flows in the last five quarters and now stands at early $14 billion of AUM. What began as a retail theme early last year is now resonating with institutional and defined contribution clients as well. We invested nearly $1 billion in SIO during the last quarter.","Fixed income demand on the institutional side is also been driven by early signs of pension plans taking advantage of improved funding ratios to rebalance and immunize portfolios, and BlackRock experienced strong LVI flow this quarter as a result.","Clients are also increasingly looking to ETFs to manage their fixed income portfolios. A Greenwich Associates report on the institutional use of fixed income ETFs found that one of five non-users plan to start investing in fixed income ETFs in the coming year, while two-thirds of existing users have increased their usage since 2011. Survey respondents named iShares as their preferred provider of fixed income ETFs with pricing, the liquidity and breadth our product offering their top considerations.","Fixed income is a growth business for BlackRock and it has our largest flow category in the first quarter. The breadth of our product offerings and performance meaningfully in excess of our key competitor positions us well for the continuing rotation within fixed income and to gain market share as the landscape continues to evolve.","Our platform breadth and diversity of our deep relations with clients are also a differentiator for BlackRock.","Gary spoke about some of the large flows we saw in institutional business this quarter and BlackRock's ability to bring a variety of products and service oriented solutions to clients often position us to recapture what would otherwise be lost opportunities.","In the case of one pension risk transfer to an insurance provider, although mandates moved away from BlackRock due to successful execution of an LDI mandate, we want a BlackRock Solution assignment to perform monitoring and valuation on that same asset pool. The service transition was made possibly by our existing relationships, our strong management capabilities and risk management capabilities and reputation, which includes providing Aladdin or Aladdin risk support services to 12 of the top 35 insurance providers globally.","As a fiduciary it is critical that BlackRock not only provides the investment performance and solutions our clients need but also to take a leadership role in advocating for the best interest and those are the broader markets and the economy. That's why last month I sent a letter to CEOs of every company in the S&P 500 urging them to focus on the long-term to make investments in their businesses that will create opportunities and drive future growth.","BlackRock believes it is our responsibility and obligation to maximize the value of the assets our clients entrusted us, and that prudent management practices and strong leadership by boards of directors promoting company's long-term successes and to lead a better risk adjusted return for investors.","BlackRock is also working actively with regulator to help build constructive solutions that improve the financial ecosystem for all investors. We recently submitted a letter, comment letter to the Financial Stability Board to address concern over the impact asset managers might have on market stability. While we share the FSB's desire for a safer market environment, and we agree with our focus on products rather than firms, we argue that leverage rather than size should be the primary stream when determining the appropriate level of regulatory scrutiny.","We will continue to engage with regulators and policy makers that help insure that regulation is appropriately focused on where risk may exist at the product and at the product level and the practice level.","Looking forward, we remained committed to partnering with our clients around the world to deliver them all that BlackRock has to offer. Last week, we hosted our Institutional Client Conference where we spoke with more than 100 clients on paving new pass to achieve outcomes for those who entrust us with our assets.","On June 17th, we will be hosting our second Investor Day to discuss key drivers of future growth for BlackRock.","I'd like to close by taking a minute to talk about BlackRock's focus on our talent. Talent is something we as a management team and our board of directors review continuously in order to build a deep bench of senior executives. We view setting high standards for talent as a core responsibility to best serve our clients and investors. We are excited to have a variety of senior leaders stepping into new roles and to welcome a number of senior hires to BlackRock.","Those new hires include Salim Ramji, who was a senior partner in McKinsey & Company, will be joining the firm later this month as our new Global Head of Corporate Strategy. Chris Jones will be joining BlackRock as our Chief Investment Officer and Head of Fundamental Equities for the Americas and Co-Head of our Global Fundamental Equity team. And Helen Zhu recently joined to help BlackRock in our Chinese Equity business. Our talent strategy reflects a focus effort we have taken to develop our people and enhance our culture.","We are committed to rotating leaders into roles that present them with new challenges, driving their responsibilities, and maximizing their impact on the firm. These efforts to develop and invest in top-tier talent will serve to drive BlackRock's long-term growth and to enhance both the experiences of our clients and the value it deliver to shareholders.","As always, I want to thank our employees for a dedicated service this quarter in helping our clients to build better financial futures.","With that, I will open up it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","First, I would like to see if you could talk about the level and the outlook for institutional fixed income investment dollars in motion. You called that in the press release the shift towards unconstrained and you talked in the call about short-term strategies, but taking this from another angle would you expect the amount of money in motion to increase further given the high profile performance and management stability issues at PIMCO and to what extent has this already started and, based on your past experience, what kind of scale of opportunity is there here?","Laurence Fink","I don't ever comment on our competitors. PIMCO is a fabulous investment firm so and Bill Gross has been a friend of mine for over 40 years, not that quite long about 38 years so. We're in a great position; we're seeing increasingly more dialogue from institutional clients than we've seen before. We began to see accelerated inflows on the retail side but now we are in more dialogue with more consulting firms, advisory firms to pension fund. So corporations are looking at how they should look at fixed income. Some of it is -- some of the movement is towards unconstrained into like SIO products. And let me just speak about BlackRock and reiterate having close to 90% of our products above their benchmark and some of them are in -- and many of them are in the top quartile now is a reason why people are coming to BlackRock both institutionally and retail.","Where we are beginning to see some increased dialogues though, Ken, is in defined contribution side where this is an area where we had very little penetration on the fixed income side, we had large penetration on the index equity side. So we are now enjoying more flows retail and institutional and in all components of institutional, and I believe we will begin in the second and third quarters to see an acceleration in terms of money in motion as you called it in the fixed income universe.","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","All right. Thank you. And then to follow-up, can you talk about the performance of the core alternative strategies so far this year? We're seeing some hedge fund strategies suffering pretty weak absolute returns earlier in this year and I'm interested to hear how your various strategies are performing and maybe which areas are performing better and which areas are performing worse?","Gary Shedlin","Well, you're correct in saying there some hedge funds that have done very poorly and that was heavily oriented towards the macro strategies. Our macro strategy hedge fund has relatively poor performance. However, our single hedge fund strategies or fixed income hedge fund strategies have all done quite well, and in fact we took advantage of some of the pain within the marketplace over the last two months.","I would say overall we performed very strongly in our hedge fund strategies. Our multi -- our long\/short equity or long\/short fixed income hedge funds where we're seeing some very large flows both retail and institutional we had good performance. So we continue to see acceleration in conversations in the alternative space too.","Two areas that I would like to highlight on the outside where we're beginning to have a total change in dialogue one is our real estate area where we have had performance issues out five years ago. And we have changes of leadership there, we did the acquisition of our teams and we are now in more dialogues on real estate than we had been in many, many years and infrastructure. Infrastructure we brought along a team over three years ago and we are now starting to see accelerating flows into our infrastructure alternative area. We're about $2 billion and I expect to see a doubling of flows over the next 12 months to 24 months in our infrastructure area. This is an area that I think is going to, we're going to have to continue to do invest in.","As we think about the world going forward, there is a greater and greater need for infrastructure in the developing world, in the developed world and most certainly in the U.S., and we believe this is a great asset category for many of our investors. And so we look at this as an area of extreme growth.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Just want to circle back on institutional fixed income specifically LDI. I thought it was interesting that the mandate wins here seems to be really concentrated in passive and not active. So first, do you think we need higher rates for this rate to really accelerate? And then, will these wins you think reside mostly in a passive business or a mix between active and passive?","Laurence Fink","Well LDI is a means in which you're trying to minimize risk and I do believe because of the growth in passive fixed income strategies in the ETF area and in obviously in the index side it's a great product for moving into LDI. So I would say there would be a higher propensity for investors seeking passive strategies and active strategies for LDI. But I think you're going to see in some care areas a growth of may be the unconstrained product areas into LDI also as a way of having a diversification in terms of fixed income strategies. But you should assume when people go to an LDI strategy they're essentially de-risking and a component of that de-risking is staying pretty current on to an index and this is why you're seeing a higher propensity to go into passive strategies.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Thanks, and just my follow-up here on the illiquid alt business which is mostly a retail phenomenon. Which specific types of platforms and investor basis are really demanding these products and I'm really thinking about what your long\/short credit and long\/short equity fund?","Laurence Fink","I'll let Rob talk about that.","Robert Kapito","So the retail base is thirsty for alternatives, and so long\/short credit and long\/short equity but both global are important for the retail base. And we've launched since 2011 six '40 act alternative products; they continue to raise money. In the first quarter alone it was $1.4 billion, and that's driven as I mentioned by the long\/short credit, which has had very good performance as well as the global long\/short equity funds, and each of those has raised over $700 million putting them in the selling fund. So it's really a retail thirst and of course that's coming from what else is available to them which is low rates on the fixed income side, and sometimes using dividend fund as a surrogate. So they need that double-digit returns and that's where we're seeing the interest from.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - KBW","First question is on just about a year-and-a-half I mean two years ago you made a move to combine the ETF and the retail distribution force. Just curious if there any way of quantifying or color you could give on what impact you may be seeing that has in terms of hoping to drive ETF flows and you like you're still at the early stages of that or is that kind of been helpful run rate so to speak?","Laurence Fink","So we are still at the earlier stages in that and what it gives us the ability to do is have more holistic conversations with our clients because clients own both passive and active whether they describe that an index funds, ETFs, or active portfolios. So most clients have been focused more on asset allocation and this way having people I can talk both sides of that conversation really resonates with them creating portfolios that are much more sticky going forward or that when there's an asset allocation they will asset allocate within BlackRock because we can offer the whole slate of products.","It has taken a while to get that underway because it requires a significant amount of training combining the sales force to have that and also to, in a sense, upgrade our sales force to be able to talk more holistically. So while we've seen success it's still in the early stages and we expect more to come on that.","Robert Lee - KBW","And maybe as a follow-up you've had really strong retail organic growth outside the U.S. Maybe give a little bit color on maybe by geographic region or country kind of where you're seeing that and kind of if there is any specific markets that I believe or by -- I know there's the odd equity business I guess in the UK, but any color there would be helpful?","Laurence Fink","Rob, it's been very broad based, it's been so gratifying. It's throughout EMEA and Latin America actually. Areas of great growth have been really, I would say the core of Europe, Italy, Germany, Switzerland where we saw very good flows. So it just continues to dominate, and then even in Asia I don't know retail flows about $2 billion came from different countries in Asia. So it speaks very broadly about our global footprint and our growing brand recognition in PacAm, in Europe and in Asia and we continue to drive a strong position as an independent asset management platform working with our distribution partners worldwide.","But also let me -- also say what is a key driver to the success is the expansion of high performing products whether it's our performance in fixed income, our performance in European equities, active equities where we're in the top decile for five years, and our growing success in Asian equities where we have Andrew Swan now with about two-and-a-half years under his belt at BlackRock with exceptional performance. So it is about our positioning worldwide globally, but it also the underlying component of that success is a growing success in our active product suite.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Matthew Kelly with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelly - Morgan Stanley","First, I wanted to just touch on the ETF landscape and there's been a lot of activity both iShares and in competitor. So I'd just be curious how active we should expect you to be on the new product launch perspective and where your efforts are focused both by product and region, and where you've seen the most interest from some of your competitors? And maybe that's a better question for Rob, either of you.","Laurence Fink","Yes, let me just give you a macro view and let Rob get into the granularity of products. But if you look at -- we had real large movements within the ETF space. In the first few weeks of January, we had up to $8 billion of outflows in EM, which was pretty disconcerting. Since that we had $4 billion of inflows. But importantly, since quarter-end, which is all public, so I can talk about it, we've had $10 billion in net inflows in our iShares products. So year-to-date we're over $17 billion of net flows. At quarter-end we were approximately $7.5 billion, so huge change in momentum.","And so getting into the both the competitive landscape change, generally when you have more I would say more of an international flavor of investing we benefit, when it's more of a domestic flavor some of our competitors benefit. But I would tell you we're in a very good position to remain a leader in the ETF business in 2014. Rob, why don't you go talk about some of the products that we're launching and we're proposing and\u2026","Robert Kapito","So we focus on what our clients' needs are the changing landscape in the markets. So we have eight new products already this year. And we're currency hedged to our enhanced international equity products and the other are fixed income. Obviously, there was a very big demand for short duration due to the fact that people -- most people thing that interest rates at some point have a higher probability of rising and there has also been a lot of interest in the municipal area.","So we're going to be very opportunistic, we're going to follow the lead of our clients. And in some cases we're going to grow market share and in some cases we're going to take market share where we may have been late to the gain but we see an opportunity and people respect the brand, our ability to have the best tracking errors and liquidity in the marketplace. So we're going to go out in both of those. But we're going to continue to be -- have our nose close to the marketplace. And we will be very active in new products that we believe that we can have scale.","Matthew Kelly - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then my follow-up is, I'd just curious to get your thoughts as a management team on the recent changes in the UK budget and impact on pension markets over there and where you're kind of -- where that -- where BlackRock is positioned to potentially benefit from any of those changes that they can throw?","Robert Kapito","Well, I'm glad you asked that because this is a huge opportunity for us and we spend a lot of time and effort developing our retirement products around the world and I think you heard Larry talk a lot about the need for retirement products. And what you're talking about is really the UK pension reform where there will be less money going into the annuity product and more money going into products that are created for retirement. And as you know you've heard us talk about our extensive U.S. DC experience with our LifePath products and our floating products.","We estimate that this opportunity in the UK alone could be about $25 billion in assets that might have gone into annuities that now will be, as Gary likes to say, money in motion. So we intend to put a lot of effort on putting together more retirement products to capitalize in this market. And I think BlackRock is uniquely positioned because of our multi-asset strategies and our product development, specifically tailored to the retirement area of which almost two-thirds of our assets at BlackRock are retirement related.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","So Michael Lewis caused quite a stir with his book that came out this month. And Larry, just wondering where you guys stand on the whole debate about market structure, whether you think the markets are rigged or whether you think regulators should be doing more to kind of level the playing field, if you will? And just kind of asking this question because giving your size and obviously you guys have a lot of influence as to how the market structure unfolds?","Laurence Fink","Well, we have invested tens and tens of million of dollars for making sure that the high frequency traders did not arbitrage us. We looked at it is a fiduciary responsibility making sure that we always provide our clients best execution. And we only do execution with the reputable counterparties and market venues. So this is something that we've been focused on for years.","Obviously, it's a piece of -- it's a book that quits, obviously greater public awareness and we think there should be greater public awareness on these activity. But this is something we've been focused on for years, it is not -- our behavior has been consistent that our job as a fiduciary and get the best execution.","We believe that market structure should always be there to be protecting investors. We believe in the concept of equal access of information. We believe in the concept of simplification of order types and message orders. So this is something we've been living with it may be in the public purview but this has been as a component of the market for years and years and years and I think I spoke about this in the past few quarterly updates that we have been vigilant in making sure that we're building adequacy in terms of our trading platform that we are providing best execution for our clients. That's what I care about more than anything else that we are there making sure that with all of the new technologies that we are not been arbitraged or that we have more friction cost in our execution.","Because of the high preponderance of our equity holdings or index, as you know, we have to be so mindful of friction related to trading. And so this is why we've been very aggressive making sure we have that we focus on best execution, and I think this is a story that should be discussed, but this is a story that we've been aware of for years and have addressed it internally in terms of our platform.","Chris Harris - Wells Fargo","Understood. Thank you very much for that. And just really quick follow-up on the business. You called out the performance of some of your newer team members and they're really having a very good impact, just kind of curious to get your thought, how long do you think it's going to take for the better performance to really start moving the needle on flows. Do you think it might take something like three years to really start getting a lot better or in your experiences could we start seeing a bigger opportunity?","Laurence Fink","I want to say bifurcated market. In alternatives you could have no track record and announce a strategy and if the strategy makes sense, we've seen this in the marketplace; people are able to raise money. So it really depends on the product itself as we are beginning to see some nice flows and certainly much more dialogue in our Asian equity platform where we have just under a three-year track record there.","It takes more than a year for the key, I would say, on products like large cap core and large cap value and it may be three to four years -- two to three-year type of process. After three years, I think you then get on many buy lists across the board.","Robert Kapito","Some of these teams though actually that have joined the --","Laurence Fink","Have carried.","Robert Kapito","Have a following. So even though they didn't have a track record here, they are bringing with them track record. So we are now that they're onboard we're seeing those people be more willing to move now that they know they have settled in with us, so we will see some flows from there.","Laurence Fink","And that's the key if they continue to have the performance that they had at their prior place, we can benefit early. But in terms of our witnessing what happened in fixed income, in that case it was really more than a three-year process in which we needed to reprove ourselves because we had such a strong position in fixed income, we lost it, and it took three to four years of building that team back and building the performance back up. I don't think there is anyone straight line that's the way that we have review all the different products, it really depends on the circumstances around the team and the product itself.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs","Larry, can you talk about the growth of fixed income on constrained. It's interesting that you're now seeing I guess an institutional interest for SIO. Is that a trend, number one, the expected institutional interest will continue to drift towards on constrained you're seeing that may be with allocations? And then relatively are you concerned at all about capacity and maybe trading friction in fixed income as the quest for returns in yield, goes more sort of off index, if you will?","Laurence Fink","Unquestionably we are in more dialogues with more public and private institutional plans than ever before on the concept of some form of unconstrained. It may not just be SIO there are other products, we have FIGO, we have other types of products. So we are and we're looking at creating more unconstrained type of product, so it may not just being one. And we are beginning to see more interest on the defined contribution side for unconstrained. So I think this is going to accelerate in a very large way.","Unquestionably anyone specific product like an SIO will have, see this could not be $100 billion fund, it was never designed to be something like that but do we have quite a bit of bandwidth and capacity for the near about future absolutely. And so we're not concerned about capacity at the moment in any one of our products. But it -- this is just beginning, this groundswell towards -- moving towards an unconstrained type of fixed income product. I think this will accelerate and I think it will become a very large -- well it is a very large component of our dialogue with institutions worldwide today. The -- what is second part of your question? Marc was that -- did I answer that?","Marc Irizarry - Goldman Sachs","Just in terms of trading?","Laurence Fink","Oh, trading. Yes, friction cost. There is no question as balance sheets of the dealers are more contained you see wider spreads than fixed income. I don't think this is a long-term problem, it may be a short-term problem; it will move, it will create more movement towards exchange trading for fixed income. And I do believe this is one of the reasons why more interest in ETFs and fixed income. So you don't have to focus on a bond, you could focus on ETFs that have maturity or ETFs that are connected to benchmarks. And so this is one of the reason why we think fixed income ETFs will grow dramatically over the course of next two years.","But there is no question, there is times of great illiquidity and fixed income as dealers have cut back their capital associated with fixed income. And at times it represents larger friction cost than other times, but I do believe that will create a faster evolution towards more exchange traded fixed income platforms.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America","Gary, maybe a few number questions. So I think you mentioned and you saw it in the release just on G&A, there were some items that were real estate benefit. And then I think non-op gains were a bit elevated and then same thing with performance fees. So I guess any color around some of those lumpy items?","Gary Shedlin","Sure. So on the G&A expense, as we mentioned the current quarter reflects what we call a dilapidation reversal, which is a function of some building we have over in London that obviously artificially reduced expenses for the quarter.","As we also mentioned, there were some lower expense due to timing of the spend; the most major component there is our MMP spend that we called out on a variety of quarters.","The fourth quarter as you know was actually impacted in many cases by the opposites, we had higher MMP spending during time and we have some lease exit cost and a variety of other accruals. So I think if you listened carefully, which I'm sure you did, in the fourth quarter we tried to walk you through what portion of our fourth quarter G&A increase was kind of tied to our continued growth of the business and we really haven't changed our view on that at that moment. So I think that the type of analysis you guys generally did in the fourth quarter looking at the first quarter, we still standby.","In the non-op side, you correctly mentioned that the non-op was driven by the monetization of the non-strategic opportunistic key investment that was really tied to some years ago where we had a little bit of different strategy around potentially growing our off business, which obviously has changed at the moment. And so I would say again there that the street generally was fairly consistent in terms of estimates of our non-op with the exception of that one-time item.","And I think on performance fees we really talked about it. I mean, we mentioned in the fourth quarter this is really the final piece of that liquidation. And at the moment, we would expect that most of the performance fees to be generally recurring in nature tied to our core goals business.","Laurence Fink","But as you think about business, we are going to have return of capital, successful monetizations of these things, this is the normal course of business and also this is why we have to continue to have an engine of growth of new products and this is one of the key components of it.","Gary Shedlin","And in connection with that again another $1 billion of commitments that were in the quarter which takes that up for now five consecutive quarters. So keep in mind that those numbers are not hitting our net new business flows until the capital is actually deployed, and once that capital is deployed it then obviously becomes available both to generate performance fees in the future.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","Just thank you for your commitment in investing in BlackRock. As I said earlier, I think the quarter is an example of the diversification of our business model, of having a strong presence in active and passive and fixed income and equities and alternatives and it really shows up quite well in our first quarter.","And probably the other two major point that I would like to lead everybody, during the course of the quarter as we had this extreme volatility and market movement, every day during the volatility we had consistent inflows, which leads me to say that much of the market movement was more of a hedge fund oriented fast money type of behavior, long-term investors were committed to putting money to work and we saw no change in investor behavior in the first quarter. Also as a statement towards -- as we look towards the second and third quarter, we have never been in more active dialogue with more clients, with more consultants, with more distribution partners about BlackRock products probably in our corporate history and hopefully we can show you at the end of the second quarter that those dialogues turn into commitments.","Once again, thanks for all the support, and I want to thank all the employees for all the support. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3459":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher J. Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Chris. Good morning and happy New Year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses, both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","The differentiation and strength of BlackRock\u2019s diverse global investment and technology platform allowed us to continue to invest for growth during 2016 despite market volatility and macro-political uncertainty during the year. We saw strong results in our iShares, institutional and technology businesses and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders.","Against a challenging backdrop for the asset management industry, BlackRock once again executed on each components of our framework for shareholder value creation. BlackRock generated $202 billion of total net inflows in 2016, the strongest flows in our history including nearly $100 billion in the fourth quarter. We expanded our full year operating margin by 80 basis points to 43.7%. Finally, after investing for growth, we returned approximately $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders during the year.","In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $5.14, both up 8% from a year ago. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion was flat versus a year ago while earnings per share of $19.29 was down 2%, reflecting lower non-operating income and a higher tax rate in 2016. Non-operating results for the quarter included $6 million of net investment gains. Recall that non-operating results in last year\u2019s fourth quarter included $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment.","Our as adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 28.6%, reflecting the impact of several non-recurring items compared to a rate of 30% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and potential tax reform. In an environment where growth in the asset management industry has been elusive, BlackRock\u2019s diverse global platform is thriving, delivering outcomes for our clients and differentiated organic growth for our shareholders.","BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter total net inflows of $98 billion included $88 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%, $18 billion of flows into our cash management business and $7 billion of advisory outflows related to crisis era portfolio liquidation assignments.","For the full year 2016, BlackRock generated record total net inflows of $202 billion including long-term net inflows of $181 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic growth rate. Fourth quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 1% year-over-year, driven by higher average AUM but offset by the impact of divergent beta, FX, and mix shift. For the full year, base fees were effectively flat. On a constant currency basis, base fees were up 3% versus last year\u2019s fourth and 2% for the full year 2016. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% as the negative impact of fixed income data, divergent equity beta and continued DoLlar appreciation more than offset organic fee growth in the period.","While we delivered robust organic asset growth during the year, our blended fee rate has been impacted by a number of factors that we have repeatedly discussed with you, including divergent equity beta and DoLlar appreciation as well as recent client preferences for lower risk asset classes and index over active strategies. However, while these headwinds are pervasive in our industry, our broad based solutions focused investment platform is built to meet client preferences in any environment, whether risk on or risk off, and we remain confident that BlackRock can consistently grow client assets and base fees, both of which ended 2016 at record highs.","Fourth quarter performance fees of a $129 million were driven by our single strategy hedge fund and long-only equity products. Full year performance fees of $295 million decreased 52% from 2015, reflecting a challenging year for the hedge fund industry. BlackRock Solutions fourth quarter revenue of $197 million was up 15% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.","Full year Aladdin revenue of $594 million, which represented 83% of BlackRock Solutions revenue, was 13% year-over-year driven by a number of sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2016. Aladdin is coming off a record year in terms of new client revenue and continues to benefit from strong market demand from both institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries. We\u2019ve seen particularly high levels of demand for our newest product, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management in a current regulatory environment and are actively implementing for clients in the United States, Europe and Asia.","Total expense declined 3% in 2016, reflecting lower compensation expense and continued G&A expense discipline. For the full year, compensation expense decreased $122 million or 3%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis.","Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $55 million year-over-year or 13%, reflecting lower marketing and promotional spend in the current quarter and $23 million of deal related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the year ago quarter. Sequentially, fourth quarter G&A expense increased $43 million, primarily reflected a planned uptick in the year-end marketing and promotional spend, and higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense. Full year G&A expense of $1.3 billion was 6% below 2015 levels, despite the impact of acquisitions on our run rate, reflecting expense awareness in the volatile market environment. Assuming stable markets, we would expect a modestly higher level of G&A expense in 2017.","Despite an overall decline in 2016 revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we delivered 4% organic asset growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as adjusted operating margin to 43.7% for the year. While we remain committed to realizing the benefits of our scale for clients and shareholders alike, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We do remain keenly focused on striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.","During 2016, we returned approximately $2.7 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2017, we remain committed to a predictable and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.50 a share, representing an increase of 9% over the prior level. Since instituting our dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its annual dividend per share at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 21%.","We repurchased approximately $1.1 billion of shares in 2016 and now have repurchased over 13 million shares during the last four years, resulting in a 13% unlevered compounded annual return for our shareholders. We remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders and anticipate a similar annual level of share repurchases in 2017. However, such amounts could vary based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price.","In connection with this ongoing commitment, our Board has authorized an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9 million shares including 3 million shares which are remaining under our prior program, announced in January 2015.","Our 2016 financial results reflected benefits of our differentiated global business model. Record full year total net inflows of $202 billion including nearly $100 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter were diversified across asset classes and benefitted from significant flows into iShares as both institutional and retail clients use ETFs for core investments, precision exposures and financial instruments. Global iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. Fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $51 billion were driven by demand for U.S. market exposures as equity markets rallied following the U.S. elections. Notwithstanding flat fourth quarter fixed income iShares flows, which were impacted by the significant move in long-term yields during the quarter, we continue to see an acceleration in the adoption of fixed income ETFs. Full year 2016\u2019s fixed income iShares in flows of $60 billion represented an organic growth rate of 24%.","BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise saw record long-term net inflows of $41 billion for the quarter and $51 billion for the year, positive across active and index strategies for both periods. Quarterly institutional active inflows of $6 billion were led by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives as clients utilized BlackRock\u2019s broad range of investment strategies and customized solutions to achieve their investment goals. Institutional index inflows of $35 billion in the fourth quarter were driven by fixed income inflows of $26 billion which reflected solutions based LDI activity, primarily in Europe.","We also ended 2016 with another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last four years, we\u2019ve raised more than $22 billion in commitments for our fund of funds, real estate, infrastructure, opportunistic credit, and all solutions businesses and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients.","Blackrock\u2019s global retail franchise saw fourth quarter outflows $2 billion and full year outflows of $11 billion, reflecting continued performance challenges in the active mutual fund industry as well as macro, political and regulatory uncertainty. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash business generated $18 billion and $29 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investments we\u2019ve made to expand the scale of our cash management offerings drove strong flows in 2016 and we\u2019re well-positioned for additional demand and market share gains in the coming year.","In the summary, in a year marked by periods of market volatility, divergent beta and significant currency movements, our diversified business model once again delivered industry-leading organic growth and consistent financial results that allowed us to continue investing for the future. We are committed to continuously evolving our platform as our clients\u2019 needs change and believe our platform is well-positioned as it\u2019s ever been to meet those needs and to deliver long term value for our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Thanks Gary. Happy New Year, everyone, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call.","In the year dominated by extraordinary macro and geopolitical uncertainty, BlackRock continues to earn our clients\u2019 trust by delivering strong results. BlackRock\u2019s fourth quarter and 2016 results reflect the benefits of continuously investing in our business to better serve our clients. We\u2019re building out our investment teams and resources, we\u2019re expanding our technology footprint and we\u2019re evolving our risk management capabilities as we continue to anticipate change in the world, in our economies and most importantly, in our industry. As a result, more and more investors are turning to BlackRock to design, to deliver investment solutions that will help them achieve their long term financial goals.","2016 was a turbulent year for investors, whether institutions or individual investors, one that no one fully predicted. Global political events like Brexit, the U.S. political -- U.S. presidential election and the Italian referendum have forced many of our clients and also our self to rethink our assumptions and our perceptions of the world. Even with some political surprises, the global economy began to show signs of optimism throughout 2016.","The U.S. equity market surged to all-time high as expectations for fiscal stimulus, reflation, and tax and regulatory reform has sparked investor optimism and enthusiasm. The Fed\u2019s decision to raise rates in December and the signal of additional hikes in 2017 suggest that the long period of accommodative monitory policy in the U.S. may finally subside at a faster rate that many have had anticipated.","However, uncertainty and the wave of populism upending the political status quo persist. And despite the rally in U.S. for domestic equities since we\u2019ve had our U.S. election, many of our investors are seeing a very different performance in their other markets. As Gary suggested, we see negative fixed income markets. We see underperforming international equities and a very strong DoLlar, which means for the DoLlar based investors with broad global asset allocation such as pension funds, the fourth quarter was more challenging than the market perception.","We don\u2019t know exactly how the next two years will unfold but we do know that in a challenging and changing environment, investors will look to BlackRock more than ever before. And our responsibility that we feel for our clients has never been greater. Throughout our history, BlackRock has always been focused on thinking ahead of our clients and repositioning our firm in advance of those perceived changes.","Our results this year in a difficult environment for asset managers reflect the benefits of our deeper relationships that we\u2019ve built with our clients worldwide in areas where we\u2019ve invested in our business over time. As Gary said, BlackRock saw total net inflows of $202 billion for the full year of 2016, including nearly a $100 billion in our fourth quarter.","We generated record annual institutional and iShares flow of $51 billion institutionally and $140 billion in iShares. We actually grew net assets in 15 countries greater than $1 billion. We had more than 53 products in retail and iShares that generated more than $1 billion in net inflows. I think those two statistics alone identify the breadth of our platform.","In 2016, the BlackRock Investment Institute reached more clients, regulators and policy makers than ever before, providing a forum for deep, timely and relevant dialog on all macro issues. The institute hosted calls after Brexit and the U.S. election, each time reaching nearly 5,000 external participants. This type of engagement has created tremendous value for our clients and built a deeper and more direct relationship with our clients.","We acquired BGI and iShares franchise more than six years ago when iShares had $385 billion in AUM. Since then, we invested in the future of ETFs, building the market, expanding its presence, building a fixed income presence, a global presence, building products in anticipation of change of demand, whether its factors or smart beta and launched innovative news. We\u2019ve grown our iShares AUM now to $1.3 trillion as more clients than ever before are using ETFs for transparent, liquid and efficient exposures, and we will continue and very aggressively in the growth and evolution of this market.","iShares generated $49 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter and a record $140 billion in inflows for the full year, earning the number one market share of global U.S., European equities and fixed income ETF flows for 2016. ETFs are being used by a diversified, growing set of institutional and retail clients. We are experiencing -- as I\u2019ve said in many of these conferences that we\u2019re seeing more and more investors using ETFs actively, not just for a passive exposure but using them actively to try to get exposures where they think those exposures will outperform. We believe that will continue to be a great, great growth area for these products. And importantly, the expansion -- the diversification of the ETF ecosystem is creating a deeper, more dynamic market for ETF trading; it is also enhancing liquidity for all investors worldwide.","In 2016, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. core franchise to deliver the highest quality product at the best value to our clients at a time when they needed it most. We received very positive feedback from our clients on this move and iShares gathered $29 billion of flows in our global core products in this quarter alone.","We also continue to invest in fixed income ETFs. BlackRock has long seen the value in fixed income ETFs and has invested for years in building this market, even as many of our industry -- many of our industry question this opportunity. 2016, the fixed income ETF industry reached a milestone, crossing $600 billion in assets with BlackRock\u2019s managing a large component of that. During heightened market movements after the U.S. election, trading volumes in the U.S. fixed income ETFs surged to the highest level of the year. Fixed income ETFs or iShares once again performed under stress in line with what our clients expected when they bought iShares, offering investors substantial on exchange liquidity. Fixed income ETFs remain a strategic priority and a significant growth opportunity for BlackRock and our clients.","Smart beta ETFs are another area of strategic investment for Black Rock where we are the number one player in AUM, growing at a 37% organic growth rate in 2016. We all know that in 2016 we saw a retail investor shipping away from traditional active funds, with the U.S. active equity mutual fund industry experiencing $280 billion of outflows, representing the industry\u2019s worst year on record. And we at BlackRock experienced some of the same headwinds across our traditional active mutual funds. But because the way we\u2019re positioned, because how we\u2019re trying to help our clients by having both passive and active, we\u2019re working with the clients as they navigate the need between active and passive.","I believe investors are going to continue to rethink their approach to active benefit; they may now move more towards factor-based strategies; they may have asset allocation or portfolio construction, but I do believe, we\u2019re going to continue to see a drive using ETFs for active returns. We\u2019ve been purposely investing in our platform to provide our clients with a full spectrum of offerings and to enhance alpha generating active strategies.","We ended this quarter with 88% of our taxable fixed income, 91% of our scientific active equity, and 65% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark, or peer median for the five-year period. We\u2019re confident that our top performing franchise like Asian Equities and our unconstrained fixed income, which are proven to thrive in a rising rate environment, are well-positioned for 2017.","Factor-based investing helps bridge the gap between active and index, and it\u2019s been an area of significant focus for BlackRock and our clients in 2016. BlackRock manages over a $150 billion in factor-based strategies including smart beta ETFs and our factor-based AUM grew at an organic growth rate in 2016 of 17%. We have a responsibility to provide our clients with the ability to focus on environmental and social issues, while simultaneously generating strong financial returns. We launched BlackRock\u2019s sustainable investing platform a year ago and have since built a range of equity and fixed income strategies that target positive environmental and social impact.","We have frequently advocated for the benefits of infrastructure investing. And within the U.S. alone, markets are anticipating up to $1 trillion of domestic infrastructure investments over the next few years. And we all know, we desperately need those investments. BlackRock has built infrastructure and broader real estate platforms, both organically and inorganically over time, and we currently manage $29 billion in real asset AUM.","We invested in our global cash management business in anticipation of regulatory reform and a rising rate environment. BlackRock is now positioned as a skilled player with the broadest range of solutions. At a time when we anticipated an uptick in demand, we saw $18 billion of flows in our fourth quarter alone, and now we have a cash management business that\u2019s over $400 billion.","Over the past year, we have spoken to the increasing depth and quality of the solution orientation and solution oriented conversations that BlackRock is having with our institutional clients in face of this global uncertainty. Even as these clients pause to assess the changing investment landscape, growth in 2016 was driven particularly by our financial institution business, as insurance clients looked to BlackRock for highly customized portfolio. Our institutional business saw a record fourth quarter and full year net inflows, cross both active and passive.","We have the right pieces on our platform but the key to designing and delivering a robust solution that targets specific outcomes for our clients is technology, which has always been at BlackRock\u2019s core. We see strong and growing demand for BlackRock\u2019s technology offerings.","More and more asset managers, asset owners, banks, wealth managers, insurance companies are valuing the differentiating ability of our Aladdin platform and other technology offerings at BlackRock to help them achieve their goals. We\u2019re constantly enhancing our existing technology as well as coming up with new ways to use Aladdin to serve our clients.","In 2016, we launched our Aladdin Risk for Wealth platform which empowers wealth managers\u2019 home offices to better understand risk. We also introduced Aladdin Portfolio Builder which provides financial advisors with highly intuitive portfolio construction tools. We continue to see robust client interest in FutureAdvisor and iRetire offerings. We also recently announced a minority investment and partnership with iCapital, the leading technology enabled illiquid alternatives distribution platform for retail investors.","In addition to technology, our people enable us to differentiate ourselves for our clients. Every year together with our Board of Directors, we take a fresh look at our organization which includes developing talent and positioning our leaders in role that can broaden their experiences and maximize their potential for BlackRock and our clients.","2016, we unified our active equity platform. We unified our beta platform and we globalized our fixed income platform, all of which will help us benefit from the potential -- full potential of our global investment scale. At the same time, they create more tailored client experience in each geography where we operate. We strengthened our regional management of our clients and marketing activities in line with our commitment to be global with a local identity and a local footprint.","It is the quality and dedication of our teams across the globe that positions us well for 2017. There are reasons that we have forged such trusting and trusted relationships with our clients and why our clients turn to BlackRock to solve the biggest financial challenges. I\u2019m really proud of the depth of the talent of the firm and leadership we have today. We\u2019ve never had a more talented group of men and women than we have today, and we\u2019ve the finest leadership in the history of the firm today.","BlackRock has been adept at repositioning our investment platform and technology capabilities in advance of change. I promise you, we\u2019ll continue to be in front of those needs and we\u2019ll continue to change with the needs of our clients. As paradigm shift, we\u2019ll have an even greater responsibility to help our clients navigate the markets and plan for their retirements. We\u2019ve a responsibility to continue to invest in broadening and deepening our investment platform. We have a responsibility to be a thought and opinion leader worldwide, globally and locally to every one of our clients. And throughout BlackRock\u2019s history, we have demonstrated the ability to invest in our business for growth like no other firm while expanding our margins, raising our dividend rates and prudently returning capital to our shareholders.","As we enter 2017, we will continue to make investments in BlackRock\u2019s future to grow our technology footprint, to expand our investment capabilities and to further enhance our talent level, all to meet our daily responsibility to every client whether that client has awarded us a $1,000 or if that client awarded us $10 billion, we have a responsibility to every client. And we are building a firm to meet those responsibilities every day. ","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on U.S. retail product demand trends including iShares as brokers modernize their business models for implementation of the U.S. DOL rule?","Laurence D. Fink","Yes. We\u2019re being very responsive to potential changes that the DOL announced, recognize that different distribution firm have decided to go in various different ways to respond to the DOL changes. So, you\u2019re going to see from some of them a shift from brokerage to advisory accounts; you\u2019re going to see some of the index funds grow, particularly the ETFs. So, there is going to be an increased focus on the performance there and of course the cost. And also, what we\u2019re responding to is a growth in portfolio construction services and the need for greater sophistication and scalable technologies where we are responding with tools like Aladdin wealth.","So, many of this is going to be model driven. We\u2019re responding by making sure that we are priced correctly in the products that we\u2019re offering, so that we will be included in the models at the appropriate price, that we\u2019re also providing the technology for those institutions that need model driven solutions, and we\u2019re also utilizing a lot of the analytics we have to help those firms. So, it\u2019s products; it\u2019s appropriate pricing; it\u2019s technology; and it\u2019s portfolio solutions. And depending upon the distribution center, we\u2019re focusing on the appropriate ones for each one of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please go ahead.","Bill Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question. I ask this quite a bit, but I\u2019m going to ask it again anyway. I guess if I look at the quarter, tremendous flows, little bit of a fee give-up, some of it mix, some of it macro, very good margins underneath that; appreciate your guidance on M&A obviously and G&A. As you look at the 2017, how do you think about that interplay between fee rates and margins assuming the markets are relatively consistent and not a lot of volatility in currency, which I know is asking [ph] a lot but just trying to get an understanding of the volume versus margin dynamic for the Company, looking ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Let me go over some of the headwind issues that we all faced and we can get into the specifics. I think we have to understand the context of 2016. First and foremost, the last quarter of 2015, obviously the equity markets fell; we had equity markets down 12% of one time in the first quarter. And so, we had huge headwinds in the first half of the year. The other big headwind that we had all year and actually accelerated in the fourth quarter was the strength of the DoLlar. And so, those are two of the big macro issues that we had to face.","One of the great statistics that I think about going forward into next year, our average assets in 2016 were up 2%, our spot close is up 11%, and that just gives you a color of some of the issues that we had. And I think that\u2019s a big macro context of thinking about how you should think about our business. Obviously I am going to have Gary go into the specificity of the fee rates, but I would just say from the top of the house, I think you said it pretty well because of the margin. I think scale is a driver that is so important how we look at it. When we look at lowering fees for market share opportunities for delivering the needs to our clients and having higher margins, this is how we think about doing this, working and focusing on the clients\u2019 needs, doing what we think is best, building market share but also driving margin. But, let me have Gary go into the specificity of your question.","Gary S. Shedlin","Good morning, Bill and thanks for asking the question. So, look, let\u2019s deal with them separately. I think in terms of fee rate, there is really four primary reasons that you\u2019ve seen a decline in our fee rate, whether year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter or sequentially. First obviously is FX. We saw DoLlar appreciation, primarily versus the euro and the pound, roughly 4% on the euro, 16% against the pound during the year and that obviously relative to the stock of our business increases the relative weighting of our DoLlar denominated FX, which tends to have lower fees then our non-U.S. DoLlar denominated product.","In many cases, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of the same phenomenon in terms of equity beta. We\u2019ve talked about divergent equity beta but this year in particular you saw various higher fee international markets, whether it be Europe, Asia X or Japan. Underperforming domestic U.S. markets; and as with the FX that also increases the relative weighting of our lower fee DoLlar denominated assets under management. ","We saw mix shift. When we talked about mix shift, we really talk about that as a client preference issue. So, during 2016, we saw clients favoring index over active, we saw clients favoring fixed income over equity and multi-asset, and even within our cash business, we saw a huge preference for government over prime funds. And in each of those instances, you\u2019re seeing changes in fee rates from what was traditionally higher fee product to at least in this year, lower fee product. And then finally, we actually took some of our own action in terms of price reductions with certain iShares core and fixed income that was later in the year, but again with that what I would call investment, we\u2019ve been very clear that we think that would be accretive to shareholder value over time and I think as you heard, we\u2019ve had strong progress today in terms of our core performance so far.","So, in each of these cases, all of these items are going to impact fee rates over time, but I think the key issue is, those set of circumstances, whether they are market driven or client driven, will also change over time. And I think the key issue for BlackRock is that we have a broad-based enough platform to be able to meet client preferences in any market and to basically deliver solutions base and outcomes to them that basically makes sense. So, that\u2019s the fee rate piece of it.","In terms of margins, I think what I would say as we think about margins, I\u2019ll give the standard statement that we don\u2019t manage to a margin target, I think you\u2019ve all heard that long enough but I think that in a year where we obviously saw a difference, i.e. 4% asset growth versus less organic base fee growth, I think we were able to demonstrate that we can basically mange the business in that environment and in fact notwithstanding an overall decline in our revenues which was fundamentally driven by performance fees, we were still able to deliver not only 80 basis points of margin improvement but record flows during the year. So, again that interplay between revenue growth and margin, I think we\u2019re pretty well-established in terms of our ability to operate in most environments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Worthington","So, to continue with the fee rate discussion, what has been the reaction to your announced lowering of fees on active products announced last quarter? And maybe, given the reaction, what are your thoughts about broadening or expanding that investment to other asset classes and other products?","Laurence D. Fink","So, the response actually has been good. And without lowering the fees, we might not be included in some of the models that a lot of the clients are now using and distribution centers are using. But what\u2019s important to us is not only performance as one of the levers that we look to go out and use to get clients to buy our products but also our competitive position and where we stand in price and most of our mutual funds have boards that we also have to respond to as well. So, since we made the changes, four of our funds have been upgraded by Morningstar, three of the government funds and one of the high yield funds, and they\u2019ve all now become middle [ph] rated. And so that\u2019s important to us, so that they are included in a lot of what our distribution forces can sell and how they\u2019re evaluated. So, beyond performance, we also want to strive to be in at least the top quartile of expenses. And of course in a very low rate environment that also helps to drive performance. So, the response has been very good by those that evaluate us, the response has been good by the distribution centers, and the response has been shown in creating and getting more assets. So, over time, we\u2019re going to be responsive to the competitive environment to make sure that we\u2019re included in the sales of these and we expect that sales will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Michael Cyprys","Just getting back to G&A, it looks like it\u2019s down about 8% year-on-year, if you back out the one-time deal costs from a year ago. So, just can you talk to what\u2019s driving that reduction in G&A, how much of that relates to tech projects rolling off versus say more sustainable cost reduction? And then just as you think about G&A over the next couple of years, what level do you think is sustainable to or required to your sustainable 5% organic growth?","Gary S. Shedlin","So, this year, I think obviously the G&A delta was as we talked about, there was some non-recurring items that basically were tied to our M&A activity last year, which rolled off. And frankly, this year, the big -- I would say the big delta as you think about G&A, obviously the biggest manageable component of that is our marketing budget. And I think that one is one that we tried to manage appropriately in a year where we\u2019re seeing lots of clients delay their investment allocation decisions with a lot of volatility. We\u2019ll be obviously looking at that pretty carefully in the context of the current environment as we get into this year. We also, as you probably noticed, just also hired a new Chief Marketing Officer, Frank Cooper who will be taking his own look at our marketing and our spending strategies that we\u2019ll clearly be taking a careful look at.","There is also some other items that I think you have to be vary worry [ph] of where FX gets in the way [ph] and also G&A impacts training, I think it has recruiting, it has a bunch of things that are obviously tied to broader growth objectives as we grow the Company. We kept our headcount pretty flat last year and that was even after our first quarter reduction that we talked about. I think Larry communicated that we needed to be in growth mode during the year and we were. So, I think frankly, the big drivers of G&A spend going forward will clearly be our ability to right size our marketing budget in the context of the current environment and will be tied obviously to our desire to grow headcount as we see opportunities for growth going forward.","The final item is obviously leveraging our scale. So, there is technology, there is real estate, some of -- is more step function as opposed to overall growth. And I think that will be important to keep in mind. I think those are really the big issues. I think that this year was clearly in the context of the environment, a lower year for us, and we would expect numbers to me modestly higher from the next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please go ahead.","Robert Lee","I was curious with the capital management and your dividend increase, and maybe the signal from that, and maybe year ago you increased the dividend 5% and as you mentioned, it was coming off of a tougher fourth quarter 2015 and a rough start to 2016, this year it\u2019s 9%, pick back up, just getting a sense of assuming we should read that to be the year certainly has an improved outlook for your earnings, your earnings profile over the coming year and next several years. I just want to get some color on that.","Gary S. Shedlin","I will jump in and then Larry can add on his views. Look, our predictable and balanced approach to capital management really has not changed. I think we remain first committed to investing in our business; we then try to target a dividend payout ratio of around 40% to 50% on a full year basis, that\u2019s a target, that\u2019s not a policy; and then, we effectively look to return any additional cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases.","The total payout ratio is really an output of how we see opportunities for the next year; it\u2019s not an input to our budgeting or financial planning process. And over the last few years, I think you\u2019ve probably seen that our share repurchases broadly have been fairly constant, in terms of DoLlar amounts. Obviously as the share price has gone up, the number of shares that we\u2019re purchasing is going down slightly. And we\u2019ve been fairly consistent in trying to increase our dividend.","So, this year, the dividend is obviously up 9% to $2.50 a share. We\u2019ve obviously reloaded our share repurchase authorization and expect that next year\u2019s share repurchases from a DoLlar perspective would be broadly consistent with what we did in 2015. And we think frankly that combination has been very effective for shareholders. The dividend has now gone up at a compounded annual rate of about 11% over the last five years. We\u2019ve got 13 million shares repurchased; I think we mentioned about a 13% unlevered return, and I think that\u2019s obviously good. And our share count is down roughly about 4% since we began this, and that\u2019s after issuing shares for deferred compensation while at the same time reinvesting in the business and effectively delevering as EBITDA has grown relative to our constant amount of long-term debt.","So, I think it\u2019s a balance and I think we felt as we -- given the stability and diversification of our model and our ability to deliver more consistent and predictable results that we just support that dividend going into this year.","Laurence D. Fink","Robert, I think you framed the macro setting well. We went into last year with a pretty harsh market in the fourth quarter 2015 and first quarter 2016. We now are seeing more conservative dividend. As I said, our average assets are up 11% this year from a spot rate -- I mean spot rate assets are up 11% from average asset, up 2 during the year. And we\u2019re following the same type of formula that as Gary suggested in terms of our dividend policy. I would say -- in absolute though, we wanted to show the enthusiasm to our shareholders of announcing a 9% dividend increase.","Gary S. Shedlin","And I will just end with this, which as I know all you guys have incredibly sophisticated earnings model, so I certainly would look to project your earnings per share based off the dividend that we basically declare each year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous. Please go ahead.","Patrick Davitt","On the comment you just made about institutional delay, is that backward looking or ongoing? And within that same, you obviously saw a big uptick in institutional index flows. Do you get the sense that that\u2019s just institution kind of meeting equity exposure, rolling into index with the intention of maybe reallocating that to more active strategy at same point?","Laurence D. Fink","No, I don\u2019t think there has been any -- as I said, we are seeing more institutions using index and the allocation to these various exposures as the active strategy. And I think this is one of the key characteristics of the market, is not taking into the full context.","In terms of institutions, I think into the fourth -- we said in the third quarter, institutions are pausing. They put some money to work in the fourth quarter; they put a lot of money to work at BlackRock in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re having deeper dialog with more institutions today than we ever had. The dialogs we\u2019re having with some very large insurance companies, pension funds worldwide are very encouraging whether they act in the first quarter, the second quarter of 2017, we\u2019ll see. But I do believe clients are reassessing their liabilities in the form of pension funds, clients are really looking at what their liability rates and the terms of insurance companies, they\u2019re looking at their asset allocations accordingly now and how they\u2019re going to do it, for insurance companies rise of interest rates, steepening of the yield curve is very positive and many insurance companies, I think we talked about early last year were short their liabilities, they were anticipating higher rates, and now with higher rates, some of them are putting some money to work.","So, I don\u2019t want to -- I think it\u2019d be unfair to say that we\u2019re going to expect these types of flows institutionally at BlackRock quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter but we do feel very good about our positioning and working with our global institutions. In terms of the asset allocation, we are having dialogs with some clients right now; we\u2019re talking more about alternatives. Rob Kapito has had two conversations with two large states in the last week about a bigger allocation in alternatives. So, I don\u2019t want to suggest there\u2019s one macro trend and one way of looking at asset allocation but I can say we\u2019re involved in a lot of very deep conversations. And I do believe the market is still misunderstanding how people are using passive strategies. They\u2019re not just using it because they want to be indexed; they\u2019re using passive strategies that are very liquid that they can navigate around markets to take active exposures.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Brian Bedell","Larry, last quarter, you talked -- we talked about the pace of Depart of Labor fiduciary rule implementation and advisor behavior. I think you mentioned that you did think it was going to be fairly rapid shift towards passive from active products within the retail channels. Has your view changed on that, post the Trump win, in terms of again I guess what are you hearing from your wholesalers on advisor behavior and then allocation and implementation right into the deadline? And maybe just longer term, what\u2019s your view on how you think the Department of Labor\u2019s fiduciary rule might change with any kind of administrative changes?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, A, I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to change. Obviously, there is a lot of talk about it\u2019ll be modified, some conversations about it, that\u2019ll be totally eliminated. We believe the DoL rule has some very great components to it. I mean, as you know what we\u2019ve spoken for years-and-years-and-years that we have done a very bad job in our country in helping people navigate to the outcome of retirement.","And having better outcome oriented strategies whether we have a DoL or not is imperative or we\u2019re going to have more and more people angry that they\u2019re close to retirement with adequate pools of money to retire. That anger then does not go away.","So, we believe the DoL rule has quite a bit of merit but I know as much as you do in terms of how that would change, if it\u2019s going to change. Does it get totally eliminated? We\u2019ll see. What we see in terms of behaviors, and this is the important thing. And Rob said it very well; we have not seen much change in behaviors from the large distribution platforms. As Rob suggested, they are moving from a brokerage relationship to advisor relationship. They are moving ahead with doing more model based structuring. In fact, we won a biggest -- we were a part of a big award in terms of how models are going to be created in terms of are they going to be using our products or not.","So, in terms of behaviors, most firms are moving forward that some component, if not all of the components of DoL will be moving forward. We are very active in helping whether the DoL rule happens or not, more and more of the distribution houses are saying, we need better technology to help us navigate our clients\u2019 relationships and their portfolios. And that is why Aladdin for Wealth is growing very rapidly and has a potential for even more substantial growth in the future. So, in terms of our relationships with most of our advisors, we are seeing very little in terms of behavior changes.","Now, I am not here to tell you, on April 1st this year everything is going to change. Could it be elongated? Sure. But I do believe in most cases, most large advisory firms believe there is a -- this is a good thing for their clients and a good thing for them. And I believe we will see some form of DoL in the future but I know as good as you what this -- what specifically does that mean.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Michael Carrier","Hi. How are you doing? I guess the question, another one on the institutional side. And I hear what you\u2019re saying in terms of you saw a lot of money moving in index but there is demand for alternatives. Just I guess, there has been a lot of cash that\u2019s been on sidelines for a while now. I mean, just trying to get a sense, and I know it\u2019s one quarter but based on those discussions, are you starting to see more interest to put that money to work, and could this be a trend that we\u2019re going to see follow-through over the next few years as institutions have more confidence, I mean if rates are rising and things are starting to move forward?","Laurence D. Fink","I think I said this earlier today on television, I think if you reflect back to the end of 2016, for those who have panicked the first quarter of 2016 and stayed underinvested or out of the market entirely, they\u2019ve been hurt. If you think back to those investors who ran away from the market in 2008, 2009, they\u2019ve been really hurt. We are working with all our clients to try to help them be more invested. So, let\u2019s be clear, we believe it\u2019s a mistake the amount of cash is sitting on the sidelines worldwide.","The problem is clients say, I just missed the last 10% or 15%, maybe I should stay in the sidelines longer. Our job is to be helping our clients worldwide and helping them think about markets, thinking about exposures and helping them build an asset base to meet their liabilities. I don\u2019t believe -- as you said, one quarter versus another is going to really determine whether we are seeing a renewed interest in putting the money to work; certainly in the fourth quarter we did. Our dialogs that we\u2019re having worldwide indicate that we may see more money put to work. But I don\u2019t want to forecast that.","I\u2019m always disappointed of how much money is sitting in the sideline. And I believe at the end of every year, we talk about this that we need to have more of our clients, more of our investors to focus on the outcome investing and not whether the market\u2019s rich or cheap, because that gets caught up and getting in out of the market and therefore missing big market movements, and this is a big issue. I believe this is one of the reasons why we\u2019re having deeper dialog with our clients because we are talking about outcomes, we\u2019re not talking about a specific product; we\u2019re not talking active or passive. We\u2019re allowing our clients to make those decisions, whether they should have a bigger allocation and passive or active. We\u2019re making our clients determine whether they should be in high yield or unconstrained bond plan. We\u2019re allowing our clients to work on how to navigate; we\u2019ll give them input about what we think. But I do believe the fourth quarter of 2016 positioned us well because of how we\u2019re constantly, repeatingly talking about solution-based relationship.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence D. Fink","Let me just add on to what I just said. So, we believe that 2016 results again highlighted our benefits of BlackRock\u2019s differentiated investment position, our technology positioning, our risk management platform and positioning, and the impact of our investments we made over the last five years are the biggest growth products at BlackRock. And so, when I reflect on our 2016, it is about those investments we made 2, 3, 4 years ago that is really now creating the volume of growth that we have. It is the scale of our operation, the global footprint of our operation that has given us broader, deeper conversations with more clients throughout the world and we\u2019ll continue to drive deeper and broader conversations with our client in 2017.","Our stable financial results allow us to continue to pursue that long-term view. Investing in these future growth areas is when you adapt to stay ahead of our clients, and that\u2019s key. Staying ahead of our clients\u2019 needs is imperative. Not responding to the question; if we\u2019re responding to the question at the moment and we are not prepared, that question will be answered somewhere else. So, I believe it is that philosophy that is carrying BlackRock, that is differentiating BlackRock, and I think it is that positioning that is going to build momentum into 2017.","I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and having continued interest in BlackRock.

Nonoperating results reflected a $23 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, largely driven by private equity, real estate and distressed credit and mortgage investments. Recall that non-operating income in the second quarter of 2013 reflected a $39 million pretax gain relating to PennyMac's IPO.","Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was impacted by a noncash revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities based on various U.K. and domestic state tax law changes, which we exclude from as adjusted results. The third quarter as adjusted tax rate was approximately 30%, consistent with a 31% annual run rate, which remains in appropriate intermediate term planning assumption based on what we know today.","In the third quarter, we saw approximately $25 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. We, again, demonstrated the consistency of our highly diversified multi-client platform, with retail and iShares driving our organic growth this quarter, more than offsetting the outflows we saw in our Institutional business.","We've raised approximately $124 billion of long-term net new business over the past 12 months, representing a 4% organic growth rate. Because 86% of these net flows were generated by our retail and iShares channels, our organic revenue growth exceeded asset growth as these channels have higher effective fee rates compared to the firm's overall fee rate, the same dynamic held true in the third quarter.","As you can see on Page 10 in the supplement, third quarter revenues were $2.5 billion, up $152 million or 7% from a year ago. Revenues were driven by base fees, excluding securities lending, which increases a function of both organic growth and market appreciation, offset by reduced securities lending revenue, reflecting ongoing softness in the hard-to-borrow or special collateral markets. Sequentially, total base fees, which includes securities lending, declined by 1%, driven by mix and a seasonal decline in securities lending activity.","As a function of the market volatility we've witnessed in the latter half of the second quarter, we entered the third quarter with lower assets on our management and our average AUM for the second quarter. During the second quarter, we were also impacted by iShares outflows and a negative beta-driven mix change in markets linked to some of our higher fee businesses. We experienced the opposite phenomenon during the third quarter with iShares inflows and positive beta, which will benefit our base fee run rate as we enter the final quarter of the year.","Performance fees for the quarter reflected solid results in our diversified single strategy hedge fund platform. Our performance fee eligible products belong to a broad range of asset classes and investment strategies and are normally not dependent on a single fund or market theme. While the fourth quarter is generally our seasonally highest quarter of the year for performance fees, recall that last year's fourth quarter included a large one-time fee related to the wind down of the U.S. government PPIP portfolio.","Our BlackRock Solutions franchise benefited from robust activity in the third quarter. Revenues were $156 million, up $28 million compared to 2012. Our Aladdin business, which represented 72% of BlackRock Solutions revenue in the quarter, grew 19% year-over-year, benefiting from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation, client seeking multi-asset risk solutions and a growing client base that is progressing through multiple bases of implementation.","Our FMA business had a very strong quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 29%, driven by advisory fees related to completed assignments and deliverables. While our FMA business continues to benefit from ongoing regulatory change, especially in Europe, the revenue profile of FMA will be lumpier than the Aladdin business on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Revenue classified as other fell sequentially, primarily driven by our decreased ownership stake in PennyMac and lower transition management activity in the quarter. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we now hold an ownership stake of approximately 20% in PennyMac, down from 33% prior to PennyMac's IPO and our subsequent charitable contribution.","Turning to 12 -- Page 12, excuse me, of the supplement. Expenses rose $50 million year-over-year, driven primarily by increased marketing and promotion spend and revenue-related items, including compensation and direct fund expense. As we have previously indicated, the investment in our brand may vary quarter-to-quarter but over -- but our full year 2013 investment will be in line with 2012. Direct fund expense is largely linked to AUM levels, primarily in our index and iShares businesses.","Adjusting for fund launch costs in the third quarter of 2012, expenses rose 5% year-over-year compared to a 7% increase in revenue over the same period and resulted in an operating margin of 41.2%, a 50 basis point increase versus a year ago.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value with our first priority to invest in our business. We completed the acquisition of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF business in July and $16 billion in assets under management, extending BlackRock's footprint in Switzerland and bringing a broader range of opportunities to Swiss investors.","In addition, while not included in the third quarter, on October 4, we completed the previously announced acquisition of MGPA, a private equity real estate investment advisory company. This deal doubles the size of BlackRock's real estate advisory business, extends our reach to the Asia Pacific and EMEA regions and reinforces our commitment to offering investors access to markets worldwide. As previously noted, both transactions will not be material to our earnings per share.","Our capital management policy remains consistent. We repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares in the third quarter, in line with the past 2 quarters. As we have previously stated, in the current environment, we would expect to maintain this level of repurchases for the remainder of the year.","Our solid financial results once again reflect the benefits of our diverse platform and strong partnership with our clients. We saw positive inflows across all major asset classes and regions, with retail and iShares driving growth in our client businesses. Similar to the second quarter, the breadth of BlackRock's platform was demonstrated by 10 funds across retail and iShares, each generating more than $1 billion inflows.","We spoke at our Investor Day about our excitement around the global retail growth opportunity. This quarter, we saw long-term flows of $8.3 billion in retail, driving 7% year-to-date annualized organic growth, a significant increase compared to the 3% organic growth we saw for the full year 2012. Results were driven by many of our key themes, including income, alternatives and outcome-oriented solutions.","U.S. retail saw long-term net inflows of $3.4 billion, with strong flows, unconstrained fixed income and alternatives. This represents a continuation of the momentum we've witnessed in the second quarter with both our strategic income opportunities and global Long\/Short Credit Funds, again, delivering more than $1 billion in new flows.","In the face of sizable industry outflows this quarter, BlackRock's strong investment performance, proactive client conversations and breadth of product offerings once again drove net inflows and fixed income. On the equity side, we saw moderate outflows. Larry will spend some time on the positive investment performance trends of our recent hires later in his remarks, but we are still punching below our weight in equities and we have consistently recognized it will take time to see an inflection.","International retail saw a strong long-term net inflows of $4.9 billion, representing an 18% annualized organic growth rate. Flows were similarly driven by our global themes, including alternatives and outcome-based solutions. We experienced strong flows into equities, led by our top-performing European equity franchise, and experienced ongoing momentum in multi-asset as clients leveraged our solutions-oriented strategies, including global allocation, managed volatility and dynamic asset allocation.","Global iShares benefited from strong industry flows in September as risk appetite improved and once again demonstrated its leadership position. iShares remains the vehicle of choice for investors who want to quickly and efficiently express their views in the market. Following the macro-driven redemptions we experienced late in the second quarter, investors once again turned to iShares to increase risk allocations, driving significant inflows. In addition, we continue to see robust secondary market liquidity, which adds to the depth of markets for our clients.","For the quarter, iShares raised $20.2 billion of long-term net new business, equities led the way with approximately $21 billion of net inflows, while fixed income experienced modest redemptions. Year-to-date, iShares has accumulated nearly $45 billion of net flows, representing a 31% share of global industry flows for the quarter and 27% year-to-date.","Our Institutional business experienced $3.3 billion of net long-term outflows globally. However, we saw a continued momentum at Defined Contribution and in liquid alternatives. We saw passive outflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter, with equity outflows more than offsetting fixed income inflows, as market uncertainties slowed institutional fundings and re-risking strategies and caused some clients to tactically rebalance the weight from passive equity.","Active flows were roughly flat for the quarter, with strong inflows into fixed income and multi-asset, offset primarily by equity outflows. Fixed income inflows were driven by EMEA and APAC clients, while multi-asset inflows were paced by our LifePath August 8 franchise, which experienced $3 billion of net inflows, representing a 17% annualized organic growth rate. BlackRock now manages more than $80 billion of LifePath assets, which are a key driver growth for our Defined Contribution business.","Active equity outflows were driven by both scientific and fundamental strategies and were primarily performance-related. Part billing remains a prominent theme with institutional clients and we saw another strong quarter for illiquid alternatives. Year-to-date, we have now -- we secured nearly $5 billion of commitments, which will generate future net new business as those dollars are invested.","Overall, it was a very solid quarter, and with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Good morning, everyone. Thanks, Gary, and thanks for joining the call. The current market environment remains challenging. Uncertainty is high and fundamentals are taking a back seat to policy decisions. The narrative in Washington that's running the debt ceiling debate is reducing the confidence in investors and business leaders, leading to a short-term focus and risk adversion. Rather than investing in new equipment or job creation, CEOs are focused on increasing stock buybacks and dividends, which does little to drive long-term economic growth. Even with a deal to avoid a default, the damage has been done by the fact that we have had a debate, questioning whether the U.S. will pay its bills, and the impact will be a slowdown in economic growth.","In the face of this market uncertainty, BlackRock diverse platform continues to perform. We saw a $25 billion of net inflows this quarter, driven by positive flows in all major product categories and in all regions of the world. The flows we're seeing today and the stability of our platform are the result of investments we made in the business over the past few years. After acquiring BGI in 2009, BlackRock went through a period of integration that led many clients and consultants to take a wait-and-see approach. Could BlackRock marry active and passive investing that created more holistic solution for our clients?","We addressed these challenges, emerging 2 organizations, performance issues and certain products and creating a single cultural identity. During this time, we never lost our focus of -- on identifying and focusing and attending to the needs of our clients. We rededicated ourselves to: One, the pursuit of alpha generation, leveraging our risk management and analytic capabilities to better advise clients and create solutions; two, we built our brand; and three, strategically position BlackRock to address key investment themes.","The combination of strong performance and risk management focus, continued investment in our brand, a strategic focus on strengthening of client relationships positions BlackRock well beyond 2014. Top quartile investment performance is critical for BlackRock to be the world's premier investment manager. Several years ago, we went through a restructuring of our active fixed income business. What was a weakness coming out of the financial crisis is now a strength, and we are seeing the payoffs. Our strong performance track record across our fixed income book once again drove positive flows in a challenging market for the asset class.","We saw more than $7 billion in active fixed income inflows this quarter despite outflows in the industry. Our 1-, our 3- and importantly, our 4- and 3-quarter year performance is meaningful in excess of our key competitors in total return, unconstrained and high-yield and low-duration products we are all well positioned for a continuing rotation within fixed income. BlackRock's early investment in the unconstrained fixed income space positions us to capitalize on what I believe will be one of the defining themes of the foreseeable future, as investors reassess risk in their fixed income portfolios and look to limit the impact of duration in a rising rate environment.","Our unconstrained bond strategy, the Strategic Income Opportunity fund, had its third straight quarter with more than $1 billion in net inflows, driving growth in retail. On the Institutional side, we are having active conversations with our clients about the diversification benefits of our unconstrained allocation, and we expect to see more momentum coming from Institutional on that front.","Moving to equity performance, as we've discussed in the past, one critical area for investments for BlackRock has been our U.S. fundamental equity franchise. Much of the confidence I have been making these changes in our equity platform stemmed from the success we had in the rebuilding of our fixed income side.","BlackRock did see $5 billion of outflows this quarter on our active equity business. While we're not satisfied with that outflow, we are pleased with the investment performance we're seeing in some of our managers. And as Gary suggested, that outflow really came more from the international side and was more idiosyncratic than outflows that were stemming from portfolio manager turnover.","Our basic value fund is more than 450 basis points above its benchmark and is in the fourth percentile. Our large cap core product has risen from the 76th percentile to the 35th percentile and these funds -- since these funds came under new management, we have seen more than $2 billion in new institutional mandates in our fundamental large cap growth portfolios through the third quarter and had additional $1.8 billion mandate, which funded earlier this month. Our commitment to rebuilding our active equity business is just as strong as a commitment we made to rebuild our active fixed income business, and I expect to see the same positive results and flows over time.","Just as BlackRock needed to refocus in our investment performance, we also needed to build our brand to drive growth in our retail businesses, and the investments we made in the BlackRock and iShares brands are now delivering those results. As we've grown and diversified the firm over time, communicating a clear message has become a critical component of our client interaction. Over the past year, we've been reaching out aggressively to clients to educate them on the risk of fixed income and the need to prepare more effectively for retirement. And we're linking those messages directly to investment strategies and individual product offerings.","we're seeing the benefit of those efforts in increased traffic to our websites, much higher brand recognition, better client dialogue, more pulls from clients and improved flows in products targeted through our marketing and communication efforts. Retail is a key focus area for BlackRock's marketing effort. As Gary mentioned earlier, our global retail business has grown organically at a 7% annualized rate this year, more than double our 3% growth in 2012. These results are an outcome of our continued focus on driving investment performance across the entire platform and our investment in the BlackRock brand.","International retail is a significant growth driver, raising nearly $5 billion in new flows, the most in the quarters since 2009. The success we're seeing in international reflects our strategic plan to diversify this platform. Our active equity franchise drove nearly $2 billion in net flows, led by European equities, and the nearly $3 billion inflows we saw in active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives, demonstrated the benefits of deeper relationships we've been building across our global client base.","Outcome-oriented investing is another driver for retail. This is a high-growth market where BlackRock has a unique ability to package active and passive strategies, backed by BlackRock Solutions risk management and analytical capabilities. No other firm has that ability to put those 3 components together on a outcome-oriented investing platform. We aligned through our model portfolio initiative last year and now have more than 8,000 live subscriptions. We've seen strong client appetite for our packaged solutions, with nearly $2.7 billion in combined flows this quarter across our 2 flagship strategies, our Multi-Asset Income and our Global Allocation product.","In addition to driving growth in retail, we continue to be focused on positioning for the long-term secular trends in the ETF market. Clients use iShares as an efficient and transparent portfolio construction tool to move quickly in and out of investment exposures and increasingly as buy-and-hold vehicles to build core exposures. We see liquidity-oriented investors turn to iShares as a preferred vehicle when they want to increase market exposures as they did in mid-September and when they want to reduce exposures as they did at the end of the second quarter. Given the volatility on the liquid side of the product set and the seasonal trends we've seen over time, we tend to look at growth in iShares in a rolling 12-month basis. In the last 12 months, iShares has seen more than $80 billion of inflows, driving organic growth of 11%, consistent with our long-term expectations.","As we further penetrate the buy-and-hold segment, both through the Core Series and our strategic partnership with Fidelity, we expect more stable quarterly flow patterns. The iShares Core Series has delivered positive flows in every quarter since its launch date, including more than $9 billion of net flows year-to-date and more than $13 billion of flows since inception, representing organic growth of 20%. And on the Fidelity platform, we've seen iShares grow at an annualized organic rate of 13%, also led by our Core Series.","International expansion will also serve to increase diversification. iShares brought in more than $5 billion of flows in Europe this quarter, and we increased our presence in the market following the closure of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF platform acquisition in July. BlackRock continues to invest in the ETFs space to drive adoption and the new usage by broadening the client base using ETFs and launching innovative products. In the quarter, we saw our first bank client purchase of iSharesBonds and we launched near a short-duration bond fund that is well positioned for the current fixed income environment.","Let's talk about performance, investing in our brand and how our investments in key themes position BlackRock to deliver value. The key to growth is translated in that progress into strengthening our relationships with our clients. The depth and richness of conversations that BlackRock is having with clients have progressed substantially in the last couple of years. I've seen that in my own discussions with clients, and I hear the same from my colleagues across the firm worldwide.","The BlackRock Investment Institute or BII is an example of all that we are building coming together. BII sits at the center of our 1,600 portfolio managers, analysts and researchers worldwide. The Institute was created with a single goal in mind, to harness the best insight from our global investment team and leverage that insight through a robust dialogue across the entire BlackRock platform to drive performance. And I do believe our performance results recently speak loudly about the value of this Institute.","With the creation of BII, not only our investment team is better equipped to produce alpha, but BlackRock is also positioned to identify market themes and share our investors' thoughts and ideas with our clients. As an example, we hosted a call earlier this month on the fiscal challenges in Washington, which was led by several or top strategists and portfolio managers and was attended by more than 1,000 clients.","Additionally, in the last few weeks, we've had strong attendance and positive reactions at client events in Asia, in Brazil and in Washington. Our reputation for problem solving continues to build as more and more people turn to us for insight and counsel. They appreciate the perspective that BlackRock and our platform affords them and helping them solve these challenging financial problems.","What BlackRock brings to the table is resonating with clients. Our products are more -- are on more retail platforms and buy lists than ever before, and we're seeing that positioning to drive growth. In bringing together our retail and iShares sales force, we're having more holistic conversations with FAs and RIAs, and you're seeing that manifest in flows from these businesses.","I've met with a number institutional clients over the last few months, pension funds, consultants, central banks, sovereign well funds, and the reception is better than I've ever seen. The identity we're building and the clarity of message that we're delivering is differentiating BlackRock's value proposition.","As the uncertainty in Washington impacted institutional client asset allocation decisions in late September, we saw passive equity outflows for the first time since 2008, driven by profit taken in equities, rebalancing and a reduction in risk. However, we benefited on the other side of that reallocation with nearly $7 billion of net flows into fixed income, largely driven by international financial institutions, turning to BlackRock for domestic credit exposure and more than $4 billion in new money from official institutions across active and passive strategies.","We also saw a strong BlackRock Solutions results. BRS continues to be a key differentiator for us in client-seeking risk management solutions. Our financial market advisory business is benefiting from the ongoing regulatory change, particularly in Europe, and we continue to have robust dialogues regarding the benefits of our Aladdin risk management platform. We are close to signing one of our largest ever Aladdin assignments.","Before I wrap up, I'd like to spend a minute addressing the regulatory process. Last month, the Treasury's Office of Financial Research released its study for the FSOC on asset managers. As requested, we will submit a letter to the SEC detailing our views on the report by November 1. We think this study reinforced some of the important fundamental points in which we wholeheartedly agree. That report stated first, asset managers or agents, they're not principals. Asset managers act as fiduciaries on behalf of our clients. Second, asset managers are different from banks and insurance companies. Asset managers don't take deposits. Asset managers are not wholesale funded and asset managers don't benefit from any government guarantees and we aren't levered in any material way.","The study also raises a number of potential risks related to specific investment products or investment practices. We agree with some of those additional regulations, and we agree that it is warrant to look at this, as we have advocated reforms to address many of this risks. However, since these risks are unrelated to the size of asset managers, we believe regulation targeted at specific products and practices will be more effective than company-level regulation or just a few firms.","Looking ahead, BlackRock will continue to see the benefits of our investments we've made in our performance, in our brand, in our strategy and our relationships with our clients. The positive impact that these investments have delivered make me more confident that we're on the right path. As Gary noted, investing in our business where we see opportunities for our organic growth is a key objective, and I see substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock on the horizon. When I talk to clients, I see them looking at BlackRock differently they have in the past. They see us as a partner, as a firm that can deliver solutions unlike anyone else in the industry.","Our ability to combine active and passive solutions on a single platform, backed by risk management and analytical capabilities or our BlackRock Solutions business, position us to take our client dialogue to a higher level. And this is a higher level, both in institutional and now in the retail side. We're seeing those conversations drive an acceleration in our business and I expect to see that acceleration continue.","Finally, we'd like to thank all of our employees for the hard work and contribution to BlackRock. We look forward to the continuing to partner with our clients around the world to deliver them all that BlackRock has to offer.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you mentioned modeled portfolio. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper there because that's something we've heard a lot about on our end. So can you help us size this in your mind and how important building modeled portfolios with advisories are in terms of getting increased penetration for iShares in the channel?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I have Rob Kapito here. Rob, you want to come over and answer? Rob is spending a great deal of time working with these channels, especially with the Morgan Stanley channel, related to models and how that impacts our active and our iShares.","Robert S. Kapito","So clients are now looking for a more holistic solution to their clients' portfolios, and they're looking for more asset allocation. And we are finding that clients have both active and passive in their portfolios. And what they're requiring now is for us to build model portfolios that they could use our products in them or use other products in them. So iShares is certainly a significant part of that asset allocation. So we think by providing these models to the advisors that, that will stimulate our -- their use of our products in their portfolios and that should help the growth of iShares, as well as our other passive and active portfolios.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Matt, one of the thing that we're trying to do, and we're not there yet, is making sure that we can use some of the Aladdin capabilities on the retail side, too. So that's something we are studying, we are in dialogue with many different distribution platforms. And so the first component of really adding value to our -- to the retail side is these model portfolios, which we're developing, but also can there be some analytical support in addition.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe this one is a little bit more for Gary, but you mentioned the fee rates in some of the iShares products and how there's a little bit of a tailwind now that your back in what we have see in the fourth quarter, there's been a lot of focus from investors on EEM. So I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of -- maybe help us size a little bit better both the impact on fee rate and sec lending fees from the shift that you saw during the third quarter and now into the fourth quarter, if there's anything incrementally you can give us?","Gary S. Shedlin","Well, Matt, I would make the following observations. I mean, I think, as we enter the third quarter, we saw really 3 different dynamics that basically created a little bit of headwinds for us since we came into the quarter. One, obviously, as I mentioned was that our spot assets under management at the end of the second quarter basically ended up being below the average for the second quarter. And that obviously was one element. Two, is we saw some clear outflows in iShares, particularly around EEM in the latter part of the second quarter, as we mentioned. And the third element was overall beta mix, which I think is very important, where we basically saw significantly worse beta performance in markets like the emerging markets, natural resources, the world index which, obviously, is relevant because we have some of our higher-fee products in those markets. As it relates to the third quarter, as we basically get through the third quarter, we basically saw all of those trends reverse. So we basically end up actually having a spot AUM at the end of the third quarter, as you can see in the tables, about 3% higher than our average for the quarter. We, obviously, benefited from strong inflows in iShares in September at the latter part of the quarter, as you know some of that was driven by EEM. And then finally, we actually saw beta improvement in those markets that are at higher fee products, completely opposite of what we saw in the second quarter. So that all sets us up well to basically enter the fourth quarter with a better run rate. On the other hand, on securities lending, as you mentioned, which as you know is part of our base fee line, we did see meaningful compression and spreads. And so while we saw our average on loan balances go up roughly by about 7% year-over-year, we did see significant spread compression primarily around the lability spreads where we saw those spread declined a little over 30%. And I would say that, that's obviously created the drag.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Can I just -- let me just add one more thing, Gary, on that. So sec lending is a result of a need for people to borrow stock, whether it's a hedge fund or our people were -- and generally you see a lot of activity around mergers and some type of corporate event. And we all know the merger market, corporate event market has been rather low compared to other years. And hedge fund behavior has predominantly been more of a derisking type of strategy this year, as evident of what our hedge fund results relative to the S&P. And so the sec lending liability spreads have come down quite a bit. And whether this is a seasonal issue or secular issue, we'll find out. But unquestionably, sec lending volumes are down quite a bit in terms of the fees.","Gary S. Shedlin","So Matt, just to finalize on that. I would just basically see that, as Larry said, that's driven primarily by the special collateral mark. And I would say that unless we see a meaningful change in the conviction of hedge funds around their trading activity, change in leverage or change in, basically, the M&A environment, I don't think we would expect to see a major change in that in the coming quarter.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I'll just -- one quick follow-up for me, it's just on the OFR report. Larry, you mentioned, and I know there's a lot to still to be determined there, but just -- can you give us a sense for what your conversations have been with the regulators kind of coming into that, going out of that? Any steps you've already take to satisfy any requirements from them or anything else you can give us incremental will be helpful.","Laurence Douglas Fink","A, we had no conversation with any of the regulators prior to the publication. That would have been considered lobbying under Dodd-Frank, and so we did not have any dialogue. And we read the results, we read the results simultaneous with everyone else. We are now with the publication. We are in dialogue with the different regulators, the different participants in the FSOC. And all I could say is the conversations are good, they're robust. Our letter will most probably be public when we submit it in November 1, but it's just a process and we are very comfortable with the dialogue and the process that the regulators are putting forth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington with JPMorgan.","Alex Kigel","This is actually Alex Kigel, in for Ken. Ken apologizes he's not able to join us today. We, basically, just wanted to know about your fixed income business. It seems like June was, in part, an inflection point for the fixed income investors. What are your thoughts about 3Q sales as an indication of fixed income investor behavior, as we continue to see rates potentially move higher at some point? Can we look at BlackRock solid fixed income sales for 3 -- for the third quarter as an indication of your resilience of the fixed income franchise? As we see it, potentially, rates start to rise?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, a, I think that activity in Washington is going to probably mute. The fixed income rate rise for some time, so I'm just going to -- I disagree with your proposition right off the bat. I think we're in a lower rate environment, a lot of people suggest today. And I do believe -- as I said, I do believe the behavior in Washington is dragging our economy down. And I actually believe the Federal Reserve is probably more reserved in terms of any movement related to tapering and there's going to be a lot more -- they're going to probably pause waiting to see if indeed the economy is impacted by Washington's behavior. It is our view that we are well positioned, as I said. We are very well positioned in fixed income because of performance. We are very well positioned because our position in unconstrained fixed income. And we are well positioned because of our solid performance in credit and high yield. So you put all those things together, if there is going to be flows, if there's rotation, I think we're very well positioned for that. And as we saw in the third quarter, we did see people look to us as -- in terms of adding fixed income exposures. And I would say, very clearly, the dialogues we're having with clients related to fixed income are more active than they have been in years for us. And so if the dialogue we're having with clients worldwide institutionally retail, if that's an indicator of forward growth, then I think we're going to be -- we're going to have consistent growth in the future.","Alex Kigel","Great. And just as a follow-up, can you please update on the progress you feel you're making in teaching fixed income ETFs to institutional investors, i.e., particularly banks and financial institutions, and as well as institutional investors and actively managed short-term fixed income products?","Laurence Douglas Fink","We continue to have -- as I said, when I've got a dialogue in fixed income, it does translate also to dialogue in iSharesBond. It's not just the active fixed income unconstrained side. It is, as I said in my prepared remarks, iSharesBonds, we have our first bank client, we have many conversations going on now and our new ETF product has been near, which is a low-duration type of product, for those who are frightened of the longer-duration products. So I think -- as I said, we have consonant whether they are in ETFs, ETF bonds and\/or our active products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick question, maybe hoping you could give some color on how you guys positioned the money funds given everything going on, the potential U.S. default, and not only maybe avoiding technical issues that can arise, but also maybe some of the knock-on effects that could come about as well?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, let me just state overall. We have dozens of teams working on contingent plans throughout the organization. Our job is to be a fiduciary and our job is to focus on even the unanticipated risk associated with any default. So beyond our money market funds, I think it would be incorrect to think that that's all we're focusing on related to default, there are many municipal bond market to collateral management of swaps to working with the custodians. You'll have to understand, the rating agencies, even if only one treasury bond, this is a coupon payment, definitionally, the entire sector then is considered a defaulted security. And so we have to be prepared for all the contingencies, whether they're T-bills or any other bond, U.S. bond, instrument. And so, I think, we're doing a very good job without getting in, in any of the details to making sure that we're anticipating those unanticipated problems associated with this type of event. As we all know, when you think back about the Lehman Brothers result, everybody thought that Lehman Brothers was it. But then when the reserve fund had that Lehman Brothers exposure, that's when I believe that we really fell off a cliff 5 years ago. And so our job is having these task teams working towards all the unanticipated possibilities that would occur in terms of collateral management, in terms of clearing, in terms of what is considered good collateral and bad collateral. So in addition to our money market funds, where we're obviously very focused on, we're focused at across all different of our platforms.","Brennan Hawken - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then a question on the regulation, you had mentioned that you guys had started up a really active dialogue with the regulators here on the back of this OFR report. Just kind of curious, it's the one thing that I'm trying to struggle to get my head around is, if there is some kind of city designation for a large asset manager, what -- how does that manifest itself, like what does it mean? Does it just mean enhanced supervision? Does it mean capital? In your dialogues, do you have any sense of that or can you give us any color...","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. But let me just step backwards, I think you're aware we have capital set aside for operational risk, that was a condition we had with our U.K. and U.S. regulators. So unlike many other asset managers, we are already in that position. We are already regulated because of PNC's 20% ownership with us by the Federal Reserve. We are regulated by the control of the currency because of our bank trust division that we bought when we acquired -- when we bought BGI. So we have -- we're a firm that is very heavily regulated across region and across all the different regulators. So your question is a good question, but I can't answer it. But I can say we have -- we are -- we have regulatory oversight by many of those regulators that other firms, if they were a SIFI, do not at this present time. And it's a good question, what does that mean? Because the OFR did state, we are not a bank, we're a fiduciary, we're an agent. And OFR stated that these are not our assets, we're not levered, so I honestly don't know what it would mean if they designated a bunch of firms as SIFIs. And that's why my comment was very specific related to one of the ways that we've read into the OFR is that maybe they are going to regulate specific products like money market funds. But they may begin some type of supervision over, let's say, all types of products that have some x amount of leverage. So that would incorporate leverage type of hedge funds and other types of products like that. So we're not -- this is too early in the dialogue, too early, I believe, in the regulatory reviews of what they're going to do. But I think the OFR report was a very fair, in my mind, a very just report about what asset managers are and adjustly cited some risks associated with some of the types of businesses that asset managers are in. And so we are working alongside with regulators in responding to their questions as best we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Larry, maybe -- first on flows, you give a lot of detail and the teams like, maybe current quarter, there's been some different trends than what we've seen kind of year-to-date. If I look at just the disclosure you guys give, iShares retail, you've been gaining some momentum; institutional has been more subdued and you guys have talked about that being a little bit more mature. But when I look at iSharesBond and I look at the, say, $45 billion of flows year-to-date, if you segmented that into sort of the retail population or the retail channel versus the institutional, like where is that kind of breaking up? And particularly in terms of -- because if I look at your retail equity flows, they've been more subdued but that's more on the active side, but it seems like the momentum is still there. So I just wanted to get some color on the iShares penetration in the 2 channels and how that would shift to flows for retail versus institutional?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Let me give this to Rob because Rob is working very closely with the whole team.","Robert S. Kapito","Yes. So basically, we have been focused on a few areas of iShares penetration. The first is, is still in the education mode. So there are a lot of institutional clients that are first learning how to use iShares in their portfolios for liquidity reasons and for access to markets, before they actually find an active manager to manage those assets. They also are looking for asset allocation from the iShares, and that's primarily on the institutional side. And we have very good penetration in there, but it's a process that's really just at their early stages. So if you think that iShares is actually grown already, we think that it's just the early stages of the growth of iShares institutionally. On the retail side, again, it's a larger education process but a lot of the FAs, who managed these particular portfolios, are using iShares more and more in their asset allocation models that I talked about before. And we are very focused on what we call a Core Series, which goes directly at what we think retail clients are looking for. And already this year, we have raised $9 billion in the Core Series. And these are more of the buy-and-hold type of retail investors, which is a segment that we have begun to spend a lot of time focusing on. The other thing is that, since I mentioned to you that we believe that clients have both active and passive strategies in their portfolios, we have combined our sales forces and we will now have the largest sales force of any asset manager going out and educating both the institutional and the retail advisors on how to use iShares. And then last, we're building up our distribution because being in the iShares business or the ETF business, it's really capturing the flag and providing the largest funds that have the transparency and the liquidity. And of course, you recognize some of those -- the partnerships that we have established, one most recently being with Fidelity, and we're seeing really good results early on from that relationship, and we have several other relationships as well. So we are seeing continued growth in iShares, continued ideas for the use of iShares. And specifically, because we're going into markets where a lot of liquidity concerns are emerging, certainly, iShares will help in providing liquidity in the markets where there may not be as much liquidity as in the past.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. Gary, you gave some helpful color just on the fee rate and the -- you know how to frame the outlook. If I combine that with AUM up around 6% in the quarter, just going into the fourth quarter, it seems like it's setting up from -- for some decent operating leverage. Anything on the expense side that's more seasonal that would offset that or it is just, seasonally, you're going to have more momentum heading into the fourth quarter, just want to make sure there is nothing else that we should be thinking about?","Gary S. Shedlin","Yes. I think, frankly, on -- well, I mean, before we talked a lot about compensation on the variable side and direct fund expense, which we've talked about, I think if you look at the, obviously, performance fees will drive relative changes in compensation levels. But beyond that, on the G&A spend, I would say that if you compare kind of the second and the third quarter sequentially and then you saw a little bit of a dip in the third quarter based on marketing spend going down, which is really all of the difference. And I think as we've been fairly consistent in our statements, that marketing spend is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. We would naturally see probably a lift up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But beyond that, in SG&A, I think with the exception of that, I think the run rate is pretty well established.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of my questions, on the Core Series having just phenomenal success that you highlight some very good organic growth. Just sort of curious, as that portfolio builds, would there be any natural internal pricing pressure for the remainder of the business to maybe reset pricing lower, just given will it likely be a pickup of liquidity in the Core Series?","Gary S. Shedlin","I don't think so. I think this is just another leg to stand on here, where there are specific clients and we're looking at a segment that's called the buy-and-hold segment. And that, typically, has lower fees than those that look for more trading. And we're seeing both, i mean, it's pretty much equity spread. So it's really different segments of the markets and this is actually a new segment for us, so I don't really think an impact the other fee segments in the iShares business.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. Bill, I would add one more thing to that. If you think about the manner in which investors buy the buy-and-hold in the Core Series, these are much stickier assets, so you're going to have much greater dollar amount and still have a much lower amount of liquidity in transactions because of the nature of the investor. So unless we saw a mixed change of investors on the Core Series, which would then lead you to think maybe there would be some cannibalization of the other ones, I don't -- we're not seeing any evidence of a migration from that. I would say that the investors are looking for more liquidity into the Core Series.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up. You didn't even talk about too much this quarter, I'm sort of curious, and maybe an update of demand in positioning in the scientific portfolio?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Our share performance is really good and it's -- we are having more dialogue, but we have not seen any real pickup in demand in that one area. But we do have, in one of the scientific areas, is our fixed income global opportunity fund, which we closed midyear, and there's a possibility we will reopen it. It's been a very, very successful fixed income hedge fund and we will probably think about opening it next year. And that had about a $400 million of this quarter in terms of growth. But it was a scientific equity where we saw that one outflow internationally. And that was just one client looking to move out of that asset category. So now I would -- I'm disappointed that we're not seeing more opportunities because we really do have a great track record in that area. And it's an asset category that is going to, really, just take more time to have the investors come back into the platform. And I -- and keep in mind, I think investors are now using more and more beta products instead of scientific, and they're using beta as alpha. And I think that's one of the outflow of interchanges in mix and the mix and style that, maybe 5, 6, 7 years ago, people are using quant strategies. And today, they're just -- and more and more of those investors are going to just be beta strategies, but actively managing their beta strategies.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Larry, on the fixed income active inflows, can you give just a little more color on -- do you think what saw this quarter was a function of more manager replacement and manager sort of rotation amongst the competition? Or is this sort of more of a rethinking going on given the sort of the outlook for rates from institutional investors?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So on the institutional side, I don't think it was -- I think it was -- I think some of it was just -- I don't know if it was a rotation out of all other fixed income managers. I think it was more just a -- the clients, these institutional clients were just generating more and more cash because of their operations. And we're winning these new assignments as they generate more balance sheet because of our performance and our long-term relationship. Some of these clients we won are existing clients with other products, so they did some form of RFPs. And because of our performance and our position, we won. On the retail side, I do believe some of it is rotation into BlackRock and so -- and I believe it's just the beginning, very strongly.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then maybe this is a question for Rob on the alternative business. I'm particularly interested on outside the U.S. just in terms of -- it looks like, this quarter, you saw an uptick in inflows and alternatives first quarter, and several that you've seen inflows there. Maybe you could give us an update on sort of the retail build out of alternatives and sort of what you expect for that business?","Robert S. Kapito","So we're very bullish on providing alternative investments to the retail investor. And it's all been about providing the appropriate wrapper in order for the retail investors to get involved in the -- in that area. So we have the alternative investments. And as you know, for a period of time, people have been separating alpha and beta, and getting their beta from passive and iShares, and their alpha from more alternative investments. And we've had those products and have been able to do that allocation for institutional clients. And what held us up on retail is providing the wrapper for them. Now within the 40 Act companies in the U.S. and also in outside the U.S., we have the wrappers and have been very successful in finding investors to go into those. Unfortunately, we have track records in those products, as well, that are long term. So it's pretty -- I think it's going to be pretty exciting to watch, especially in the long\/short credit, where we have significant expertise and the track records. And in this particular environment, that gives people a lot more opportunity for yield, which is what they're looking for. So this will help us provide the retail investor with the same alpha\/beta separation as we're doing the institutional, and I would look for significant increased sales in those particular areas because it make sense for the client.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I would add one other thing, Marc, our single strategy hedge fund have done quite well in terms of performance. And our objective, just like building our brand in retail, we are aggressively trying to build our brand in alternative space, too. And that's going to be an important component of our future growth that we identified, not just as a passive manager in an active equity and fixed income, but we're identified as a strong solution for alternative needs. And importantly, we have a very big forward calendar in terms of commitments in our illiquid products. So we are -- we're seeing more and more dialogue with our investors in the alternative space. Rob talked about the retail side, but the institutional side is quite robust, too.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. I was just going to ask along those lines. I know the pipeline is something you guys don't necessarily disclose much, but could you give some -- maybe some color on sort of what the composition of the pipeline would look like across the firm?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I just got kicked by my General Counsel. We've determined that it's just -- we don't talk about that forward, or about our forward calendar anymore or forward commitment, but we're fine. But on the -- I'll leave it at that, I'm being kicked again.","Operator","This concludes our teleconference, Mr. Fink, do you have any final remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I just want to thank everybody for the commitment they have. This was a truly differentiated quarter for us. I'm very happy with the results, especially with all the debates that are going on in Washington. And as I said in my formal comments, I think we're very well positioned due to the platform that is unparalleled in terms of active, passive platforms with our overlay of risk management, and that continue to drive these unique dialogues that we have with our clients. And I look forward to talking to everybody after the fourth quarter. And hopefully, everyone has a very good end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Teleconference.","Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period.","Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow - Senior Managing Director & General Counsel","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements and call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results, may of course differ from those statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed and will file reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And BlackRock assumes no duty and will not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, let's begin the call. Gary?","Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director","Thank you, Matt, and good morning everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2015. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.","Our second quarter results again demonstrate the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest and most global suite of active and investment investment \u2013 index investment offerings, and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients. Our business model was purposely designed to deliver differentiated results in the current viable market environment. Second quarter revenue of $2.9 billion was 5% higher than a year ago while operating income of $1.2 billion was 10% higher on a year-over-year basis. Earnings per share of $4.96 were up 1% compared to a year ago reflecting lower non-operating results, and a higher normalized tax rate in the current quarter.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $3 million of net investment losses, largely driven by net losses on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Recall that our first quarter non-operating results included a one-time gain of $40 million related to the fair value of our pre-existing interest in BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared to an as-adjusted tax rate of 24.8% in last year's second quarter that benefited from several favorable non-recurring items. We currently estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2015.","Second quarter long-term net outflows of $7 billion reflected elevated market volatility, as $24 billion of net new business from active and iShares products was more than offset by $31 billion of low fee institutional index outflows. While this resulted in an organic asset growth rate significantly less than our target for the quarter, our annualized long-term organic base fee growth rate was in excess of 5% as each of our retail and iShares businesses along with the active component of our institutional business generated positive organic growth in the second quarter.","Over the last twelve months, notwithstanding the increasingly unsettled macroenvironment, BlackRock's highly diversified platform generated approximately $180 billion of long-term net new business, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate, as faster growth in our higher fee channels continues to contribute to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix.","We previously discussed the importance of organic-based fee growth rate to our business and we're always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure to help investors and analysts better understand our business. As you will note on Page 2 of our earnings supplement, we have now expanded our financial disclosure to include organic base fee growth on a trailing 12-month basis to better reflect this positive mix change over time.","Second quarter base fees rose 4% year-over-year as the average AUM increased due to organic growth and market appreciation despite $191 billion of negative FX impact associated with dollar appreciation against foreign currencies over the last 12 months. On a constant currency basis, we estimate that quarterly base fees grew approximately 8% year-over-year. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% reflecting organic base fee growth, the effective one additional day in the quarter, and seasonally higher securities lending fees.","Performance fees of $136 million were up 18% from a year ago, reflecting strong alpha generation in certain equity products that lock annually in the second quarter. BlackRock Solutions' revenue of $161 million was up 10%, both year-over-year and sequentially.","Our Aladdin business, which represented 80% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 14% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, the year-over-year increase driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last 12 months. We continue to see strong market demand for global investment platform consolidation and multi-risk solutions.","Revenue in our financial markets advisory business was flat year-over-year, reflecting the positive impact of residual disposition activity in last year's second quarter, but up $11 million sequentially driven by increased revenue from several advisory assignments associated with Fed CCAR diagnostics. Other income declined $9 million from a year ago, reflecting lower 12b-1 fees and the impact of real estate-related disposition fees a year ago.","Total expense rose $12 million year-over-year or 1%, driven primarily by revenue-related items including incentive compensation, AUM-related expense, which were largely offset by a decline in G&A expense. Compensation and benefits increased $65 million year-over-year or 7% due to higher head count and incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.","G&A expense decreased $65 million year-over-year as a result of lower levels of marketing spend in the current quarter and the impact of elevated legal and regulatory expense in last year's second quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $27 million from the first quarter, driven by lower levels of marketing spend. Second quarter G&A expense also included a previously disclosed $4 million product placement fee associated with the recently announced ABR Refunding.","Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.9% was positively impacted by the lower level of quarterly G&A spend. Looking forward, we continue to anticipate a higher and more normalized level of G&A spend during the second half of 2015.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, on June 12, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Infraestructura, the leading independently managed infrastructure investment business in Mexico. We expect to close this acquisition in the fourth quarter of this year.","During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares and refinanced $750 million of debt with a 10-year \u20ac700 million denominated note bearing a 1.25% coupon. This represented our first euro-denominated debt issuance better aligning our capital structure with our global business.","Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long-term client partnerships, and commitment to investment performance. Second quarter long-term net flows were impacted by over $30 billion of low fee institutional index outflows, which masked almost $13 billion of active inflows driven by our improving fundamental equity performance, top tier fixed income performance, and strength in our multi-asset and alternatives businesses.","BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $11 billion, representing 8% annualized organic growth for the quarter and 10% organic assets growth over the last 12 months. Flows were driven by continued strength and outcome-oriented offerings, including unconstrained fixed income and multi-asset strategies. International retail net inflows of more than $3 billion were paced by strong flows into global unconstrained fixed income and international equities.","For the quarter, our leading European equities franchise generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows, while our top quartile Asian equity franchise gathered more than $1 billion in new assets. Leadership in these areas contributed to BlackRock maintaining its year-to-date number one ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows and its market leading position in the United Kingdom.","U.S. retail inflows of more $7 billion reflected strong fixed income flows (9:33) broad-based even in a period of rising rates. Despite a challenging quarter for industry flows in U.S. active mutual funds, the depth and breadth of our franchise positioned BlackRock to continue to grow market share as we rank in the top five in U.S. retail industry flows for the quarter, and saw a strong demand for iShares from U.S. retail clients.","Global iShares generated $11 billion of net new flows, representing 4% annualized organic growth for the quarter, and 11% organic growth over the last 12 months. While the ETF industry experienced quarterly volatility amid uncertainty in global economic growth and central bank policies, year-to-date flows for both iShares and the ETF industry remain in record territory.","iShares retained its number one global market share position for the first half of the year, and remains well ahead of the competition in global fixed income flows. iShares equity inflows of $9 billion were led by flows into non-U.S. equity exposures, including our EAFE and Japan funds. We continue to see heightened investor focus on risk management as our currency hedge funds gathered nearly $4 billion, and our minimum volatility funds raised more than $2 billion during the quarter. iShares fixed income inflows of approximately $2 billion reflected flows into investment grade corporate and emerging markets bonds, offset by outflows from treasuries and high-yield as investors repositioned portfolios amidst global rate movements.","Our institutional business experienced $29 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, primarily driven by $35 billion of low fee index equity outflows from several large clients looking to reallocate, rebalance, or meet their cash needs. As previously mentioned, these low fee index outflows had a limited impact on organic base fee growth for the quarter.","Institutional active net inflows of more than $2 billion reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset and alternatives capabilities, offset by outflows in active equities. Multi-asset inflows of more than $4 billion were driven by solutions-based funding, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and continued strong demand (11:37). Excluding return of capital of approximately $1 billion, net inflows of $2.3 billion into core institutional alternatives were broad-based, including alternative solutions, hedge funds, real asset, and fund-to-fund offerings. Fund raising momentum continued with an additional $1 billion of illiquid alternative commitments raised in the second quarter, bringing total unfunded commitments, a source of future net inflows, to approximately $11 billion.","Active equity outflows of nearly $2 billion resulted from a single sub-advisory redemption. Overall, BlackRock's second quarter reflected continued growth and stability in a more volatile environment, and once again, demonstrated the value of our highly differentiated and diversified platform.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Gary and good morning everyone, and thank you for joining the call.","Our second quarter results were driven by clients' continued trust in BlackRock, to help them navigate an increasingly unpredictable financial and economic landscape. Uncertainty and anticipation around the first Fed rate hike in nine years and concern related to the possible impact of a Greek Eurozone exit has led to persistent volatility in currencies, in risk asset prices, and global interest rates.","Turmoil in China's equity market has reached unprecedented levels, and the impact of intervention is yet to be fully understood by our markets. Falling commodity prices continue to put pressure on commodity exporting economies, and both governments and corporations are being meaningful impacted by a relative currency valuations.","Constrained liquidity conditions are further magnifying market stress and volatility, and I believe, this elevated volatility will be going forward, and I believe are part of the market. Both asset allocation to beta and alpha products in active management will be material drivers of returns for investors as they look to stay ahead of the changing market dynamics. Each of those drivers impacted client behavior in the second quarter. As we saw a shift inflows from a range of high-performing active products and iShares precision exposures, while experiencing redemptions in low-fee broad market index accounts. The investments we made in our platform over time once again has enabled BlackRock to create this highly differentiated investment solutions across asset classes, investment styles, and geographies for our clients.","At BlackRock, we are focused on delivering our best thinking and resources to our clients and our portfolio management teams. The BlackRock Investment Institute continues to lead that discussion, as evidenced by a recent client call in Greece, which was attended by nearly 3,000 clients. This level of engagement by our clients is translating into increased partnership with BlackRock to meet their investment needs. And more clients throughout the world are looking for BlackRock and BlackRock's ideas, which we believe over a long cycle, will lead to more share of wallet with these clients.","Our internal culture of information sharing and our relentless focus on risk management and performance in our active businesses is also enhancing BlackRock's ability to generate alpha on behalf of our clients and has resulted in strength across our active platform in performance and inflows. We've been very vocal about addressing the performance challenges in our active equity business. More than three years ago, we began upgrading our portfolio management teams in our Asian and U.S. fundamental active equity franchises. While we knew these changes will result in a near-term outflows and it would take our teams many years to build the performance track records, we have the conviction based on past successes in revamping our active fixed income business, and we kept our focus on the long term for our clients. We brought in new portfolio managers who are currently responsible for more than $50 billion in assets, and those managers are delivering on their objectives of generating high quality risk adjusted returns.","We not only hired new talent, we invested in technology, we elevated young talent from organic growth internally, and linked the global equity platform together, to more effectively leverage the benefits of BlackRock. Since the respective start dates, those managers have generated more than $2 billion in alpha for the BlackRock clients.","As a global firm, our objective is constantly outperform across our fundamental active equity platform, and we've seen top performance in a range of products and regions. For the three-year period, in the United States, our basic value fund is at 11th percentile. In Europe, our European value fund is in the fourth percentile. And in Asia, our Asian dragon fund is in the 16th percentile.","In the second quarter, BlackRock saw improvement in our overall fundamental active equity performance figures with 78% and 61% of our AUM is above market or peer medium for the one- and three-year period. And strong long-term track records for our European and Asian equity franchises as Gary discussed is translated into flows, raising more than $3 billion collectively in the second quarter. We still have work to do with our fundamental active team, but we remain highly confident in the enhancements we made with the team that we have onboard and we are very encouraged by the direction the business is headed. We also saw continued strength in generation of strong performance across our model or scientific active equity platform. With 85% and 95% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for one- and three-year period.","And in our active fixed income, performance remained strong across the platform with 89% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the three-year period, translating into continued momentum and flows.","Against the divergent and volatile backdrop and a challenged quarter for industry flows, BlackRock saw a total of net long-term outflows of $7 billion, as $24 billion of net inflows into active and iShare strategies was offset by a $31 billion net outflows in these low-fee institutional index strategies.","Importantly, from a regional perspective, we saw $18 billion of net inflows in the Americas, offset by a net outflows of $25 billion from international clients who were more directly exposed to all the macro challenges that I discussed. As Gary discussed, focusing solely on organic asset flows misses a critical component of our story.","BlackRock generated long-term organic base fee growth of 5% in the second quarter, reflecting the effectiveness of our differentiated business model and the combination of active and index on a single platform, as higher fee active flows drove robust revenue growth more than offsetting any revenue loss from our index outflows.","In the second quarter, we saw sizable institutional index equity outflows driven by redemptions from international and official institutional clients due to a variety of cash needs and asset allocation decisions. A number of those outflows from institution clients, however, have been offset by inflows by the same clients into BlackRock's active strategies. This is a very important component that we all should be focusing on, because as we discussed how we are building our unique business model, having the ability to have clients internally move assets around whether it's from beta to active or active to beta, this allows us to continue to build deeper and more elongated relationships with our clients.","Year-to-date, a desire to reallocate or address cash needs drove ten of our largest clients to redeem over $40 billion in institutional index assets. However, those same clients reinvested across BlackRock's active equity and fixed income, multi-asset and, also, alternative strategies resulting in a positive net revenue impact for the firm. This demonstrates the value, as I said earlier, of a deep strategic relationship we remain with our clients and validate strongly the strength of our solution-oriented business model.","Second quarter active net inflows of $13 billion was driven by fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives. We remain bullish on the opportunities in active fixed income as investors stuck to a prolonged low rate environment searching for both yield and capital preservation. BlackRock generated $9 billion of active fixed income net flows across unconstrained, high-yield and total return strategies.","The breadth and diversity of BlackRock's fixed-income platform resonated in the second quarter as clients reposition assets to achieve their investment goals. For example, our iShares high-yield range saw net outflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. The top performance we have in our active high-yield franchise positioned us to capture $2.4 billion of net inflows. Alternatives was also a contributor to inflows in organic base fee growth in the quarter with $2 billion of net inflows. Alternative flows were led by alternative solutions, where BlackRock is leveraging our differentiated model, and our market position to construct outcome-oriented, multi-alternative portfolios for our clients.","BlackRock continues to build out our capabilities and infrastructure, which is an important asset class that provides long-term returns for our clients. In the second quarter, BlackRock announced the acquisition of Mexico's leading independent managed infrastructure investment firm. This acquisition advanced to BlackRock's growth strategy all throughout Latin America, obviously, and including Mexico, and demonstrates our firm \u2013 strong commitment of being a leader in infrastructure investments.","This is a continuation of the expansion of our infrastructure footprint in Mexico, following the partnership with Pemex, we announced in March. We also believe that building out our infrastructure platforms throughout the globe will make us a stronger and a more meaningful leading player in each local market. And I believe it's very imperative to understand, infrastructure investing for BlackRock will lead us to have a stronger mutual footprint as we grow out our businesses worldwide.","And as I said repeatedly over years and years, we need to be a local firm in every country to build the trust and the strength as we become much more of a global platform firm. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, client service, operational efficiencies, and our unifying Aladdin technology platform. Aladdin generated 14% revenue growth year-over-year and Aladdin's growing value as a third-party platform positions BlackRock to invest a consistent and growing stream of revenues into improving our technology and expanding our offerings.","And indeed, more and more clients are looking for risk management platforms as more investors need to go more global, the need for a more robust capital market focused technology platform is more imperative today than any other time and BlackRock Solutions' Aladdin is becoming the driving risk management platform and that more and more clients are looking to take on.","The next step into the evolution of our business and ability to generate alpha is a further harnessing technology to create innovative investment strategies for our clients. Over the last few years, we have become increasingly focused on becoming a data-driven company. Available data is exploding for the financial services industry and the true winners will be the firms that can extract information and package it into innovative solutions that generate alpha and outcomes for our clients.","We recently hired Dr. Andrew Ang to be our head of our new factor-based strategy group. Andrew joins us from Columbia Business School and is an innovator in factor-based investing and portfolio construction.","Technology is also going to become a more important part of our \u2013 adapting to our evolving fixed income landscape. Throughout the quarter, there has been elevated focus on the state of the fixed-income markets. There are a variety of dynamics at play including extraordinary monetary policy, increased bond issuance and regulatory reform, which has contributed to reduced dealer inventories and lower turnover. While media attention has only spiked in recent months, BlackRock has been focusing on the issues for several years, how to enhance our trading capabilities, how to enhance our portfolio construction and risk management, as well as being a thought leader on the topic.","Going forward, it is important for all market participants to recognize that we can't turn back the clock. We need to shift the dialogue to look forward and focus on solutions. BlackRock hopes to play a constructive role in helping our clients meet the challenges of today's market environment. We are also making recommendations on what the regulators and market participants can do to help improve the market ecosystem using a three-pronged approach, including modernizing the market structure, addressing liquidity challenges at the product level, and embracing product innovation like fixed-income ETFs.","As our client investment challenges evolve, so does the nature of the solutions they require. BlackRock's business model was deliberately built to deliver a multi-facet solution to our clients. And I don't believe any other investment firm can provide this multifaceted solution. BlackRock's ability to leverage these capabilities across a diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income, multi-asset and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics, risk management, and advisor capabilities, leading investment performance and client service \u2013 big sentence here \u2013 continues to result in improved outcomes for our clients and our shareholders.","As always, I want to thank our employees for the continued dedication to working and to create a better financial future for our clients.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","your first question comes from Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Luke.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks. I really appreciate the addition of the organic revenue growth disclosure in the supplement, so thanks for that. I was hoping you might provide a little context \u2013 just a little more context around the various drivers of revenue yield and base fee growth between FX translation, AUM inflow mix shift and anything around the anterior rates of AUM and revenue yield as you head into Q3?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That feels like a half an hour answers though. Okay, Gary.","Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director","Well, Luke, we appreciate that you recognize that we are trying to add to a more appropriate disclosure for you guys. I think as we've talked about at length with you guys, the fee rates are constantly changing for us. It's a function of not only the organic component, which I think we're now demonstrating to everybody that is in our control. And as we continue to see stronger growth in our higher fee retail and iShares businesses, which carry higher fee rates on an organic basis. If nothing else changes in the world, we would expect the overall fee rate to be accretive for us.","In other words, obviously, organic revenue growth in excess of organic AUM growth obviously helps that over time. However, we can't control things like divergent beta and FX. And obviously, as we've talked about over time, that will have an impact depending on where we go. In this quarter, it happened to help us, but in other quarters, it has hurt us over time.","As you know, U.S. equities rose about 5% over the last year in terms of U.S. benchmark AUM that's about 32% of our equity base fees, but in fact is the lowest fee geography for us at around 13 basis points. On an FX adjusted basis, year-over-year, we saw EM in Europe down between 10% and 12% each, commodities down close to 30%, and those buckets are about another third of our equity base fees and have average fee rates significantly higher around 46 basis points.","So in this case year-over-year the overall fee rate was down about 0.6 points or roughly to about 22 basis points due to that. But we benefited from some of that. In the current quarter, also, we had better mix and we had an additional day, which basically helped the sequential fee rate up close to 0.9 basis points.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look I would also add a little more color to what Gary just said. Three, four years ago, if we saw outflows in index funds, we may not have seen the active flows. What I think what is really illustrative of all the hard work we've done over the last few years is we are now part of that dialogue and more and more clients that we are able to do this. As we suggested, a lot of money that was, in terms of the outflows, was more cash need driven by our clients for rainy day issues and it's raining in some of the commodity-based economies, and so they're utilizing some of that.","I think one of the things that is important to understand. I don't think the market understood how much flows that were generated by these large institutions internationally into the equity markets and in some cases, it's turned because they have needs for domestic needs, but we are seeing we have more increased dialogue on multi-assets in European equities, Asian equities, alternatives than we've ever had in the history of the firm. So, the dialog is more robust and certainly a lot more complete and I think that's a component of the story. As Gary said, we can't control FX, we can't control divergent beta.","As Gary suggested, there has been quite a bit of divergent beta in the commodity-based stuff, even in the last few weeks of June or first few weeks of July, we've seen more divergent beta again. And so we can't control that but we certainly have and probably the key issue that we can control deeper, more robust conversation with more clients worldwide.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then separately, now that IOSCO has filed the FSOC impact off the approach of indentifying specific asset managers as SIFIs in favor of a focus more on products and activities. Do you think that change in the odds of how the FSB will ultimately approach regulation of the industry and if we reached a favorable tipping point or it's not time to relax yet?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would not relax. I won't \u2013 I don't think we should ever relax. Obviously, let me just step back and say, A, if the market is a safer, stronger market and more people believe that the market is a great place, if regulation does add greater safety and soundness in the minds of more and more investors, we'll be the biggest beneficiary. So our whole approach to regulatory conversation is somewhat different than with some of the other leaders in the industry. We are \u2013 we have traditionally \u2013 and I continue to believe, we will continue to do that tradition of having a deep dialog with regulators using our international knowledge of what's going on and helping them try to understand what would be the best way to make a safer and sounder dialog.","So, I don't want to say the conversation is going to be more relaxed in the future because we need to still work with the regulators, understanding what are the potential issues as the world becomes more dependent on capital markets. And that's happening now as the ecosystem change with higher capital standards with banks and more and more enterprises whether it's companies or individuals are using capital markets for raising capital, both debt and equity. We need a safe and sound ecosystem. And if it means that having more supervision in some of the activities, we may be in favor of that. So we are going to work towards building a safer and sounder capital markets, and we have enjoyed deep relationships with the regulators. And obviously they don't have to listen to us, they are our regulators. But, by having, what I would call, a constructive dialog, I believe it allows us to be part of that conversation, and hopefully, this will lead to a better outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Alex.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Larry, first question, on fixed income markets for you guys. Obviously, we saw a pretty big move in the ten year and the quarter, BlackRock's overall fixed income franchise did a pretty good job, obviously handling this move. When you look out, with respect to client's response to prospect of higher rate announcing the move we've seen so far, what are you hearing with respect to the overall allocations and just kind of the remix...","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I find this a humorous narrative. There is a big article a couple of days ago, I think even Barron had a big article about, oh, what's going to happen in fixed income. Hey, higher rates will lead to more players in fixed income, not less, and I'll get into that in a minute.","Secondarily, 70% of our fixed income investors are pension and insurance companies. They're not influenced by market moves. They're trying to match a liability, and that's the problem with the narrative, they're not the players who're going to whip around the interest rates. But the true component is, so many pension funds and insurance companies were so harmed by lower interest rates.","In some cases, we know many insurance companies have actually a wide gap \u2013 their liabilities are longer than their assets. So, if we actually saw a rising rate environment, this is actually quite additive to the balance sheets of insurance companies. If we saw a rise in interest rates, especially in the short end, the pension funds liabilities will look less onerous, because it's all based on their funding rate and the capital rate they used for their short-term rates. In fact, many pension funds, if we saw a real spike in interest rates, would (36:39) a lot of their pension liabilities.","So, higher rates actually is good for most long-term investors and they're not particularly concerned about rising rates and they're going to have money, because their liability \u2013 they bought these fixed interest items against certain fixed-based liabilities. And so, they're not going to be that harmed on that.","Now, they may have some accounting treatment differentials, but it's not going to be a big issue. And for those who believe they want to navigate around the potentiality of higher rates, they're going to navigate from a long-dated asset \u2013 longer duration fixed-income product to a shorter duration one. And for those who still need to be in more long duration, but they're going to go into more the unconstrained products that we are the leading driver in flows.","So I think people just forget they're implying that everybody is a hedge fund when higher rates means everybody's going to be abandoning bond funds. Now some individuals were in fixed income because of safety and soundness. They don't generally whip them around either. They're going to hold them to maturity. But another thing, Alex, that I think we are miscalculating too, more and more money is going in defined contribution plans. More and more defined contribution plans are using target date types of structures. And last I checked, we're living longer, but more importantly we're all aging, at least I am. And as you age, you're going to have a higher component of fixed income.","So I would tell you fundamentally, demographically, and all the things that we're structurally seeing the way people are positioned, higher rate is not a bad thing for the fixed income market for the core investors.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All makes sense. And just a follow up I guess around the regulatory discussion. Given what it looks like more of an increased focus on liquidity and risk management on a product base as opposed to the, hopefully, a firm basis. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity set to monetize Aladdin's capabilities of your sales or licensing the product to other asset managers since it seems like that's going to be the area of focus for a lot of your peers?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are \u2013 we probably have increased dialogue for Aladdin than ever before. Unquestionably, higher regulatory supervision for activities would lead to more need for risk management. Aladdin is one of the \u2013 obviously, one of the risk management participants in the marketplace. Fiduciary standards are increasing \u2013 people want to have better understanding of their risk embedded. As more and more managers, embark in more \u2013 in a larger, more robust global portfolio, they need better risk analytics.","And so, all this is leading to greater utilization for platforms like Aladdin. Obviously, we have many great competitors, so I'm not trying to suggest we're the only player, but we are in a very good position, to have deeper, longer, and probably more numerous conversations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Dan.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Can you discuss a little bit more detail about some of the rebalancing that is occurring in the index products. Maybe the type of customers, are the kind of discussions, something you anticipate ongoing and it does seem, I think you referenced most of it, coming from the EMEA region, but just a little more color that would be helpful?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think, I referenced what region. It's international what I said. We've had times, if you go back six quarters or eight quarters and we had big rebalancing then. People use beta as a place holder of a tactical allocation, I mean that's one thing that people still don't understand how much beta products are being utilized now for alpha. And there are many enterprises are tactically allocating whether overweighting or underweighting using beta products.","And we see this more increasingly every day and in some \u2013 and in the second quarter and part of the first quarter, we saw some of the big utilizers who had beta as an alpha component of their tactical allocation for \u2013 in some cases, they were taking profits and then they \u2013 because of domestic issues, they are sitting with higher cash balances, some of them may have been a little more frightened of what's going on in some components to the world and are putting more and more money in cash.","But more importantly, I would say, most of the tactical allocation was out of investment products, more into cash for domestic issues. And this was not a performance issue, this was not moving money from BlackRock to another manager in most cases. It was moving from BlackRock to another BlackRock product and in most cases, the money was used for domestic needs, work needs.","Daniel T. Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you. And then, Gary, a question on just the G&A outlook. It's been a volatile for you last few quarters, I guess. Are we still expecting a ramp into the back half of the year, and if you could help kind of think of \u2013 help us with some quantification around that?","Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director","Sure. Look, I think as we look at the quarter, I think there's no question that our second quarter margin benefited from a lower level of G&A spend. If you recall, last quarter, where many of you've pointed out a year-over-year decline in our operating margin, we communicated to you that we felt our reported year-over-year margin comparison really understated the operating leverage in the business. And I think this quarter, frankly, we had the opposite. I think that our 250 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion is overstated by a lower level of G&A spend that frankly is not likely sustainable.","Look, part of the lower level of G&A spend in the quarter is better financial discipline in the current environment, but part of it is frankly simply expenses that came in lower than we expected, and I wouldn't \u2013 I really wouldn't read too much into it on a trend basis. It was simply a low G&A quarter relative to historical spend levels.","Looking forward, I think I would say we continue to anticipate a higher, more normalized level of G&A spend in the second half of the year, and at this time, we're not intending to \"push out,\" I think the words that you may have used, that reduce second quarter spend into the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Brian.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning. A question on ETF and maybe if you could dissect the flows between core series and what you're seeing in the institutional usage. May be, Larry, if you can comment on.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I will let Rob.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I'm sorry.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I will let Rob comment on that one.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, sure. Yeah. Just a comment on the traction that you're getting in the financial advisory community on the core series and then also a commentary on institutional usage including hedging and may be as you mentioned as a substitute for fixed income, both cash trading and derivatives increasing usage of ETF.","Robert S. Kapito - President","So the exciting part of the ETF business is that as people become more aware of the benefits of ETFs, they're coming up with other uses for ETF. So it's become not only a way to express your view in the market, but you can express it in a much more precise way. So a lot of the flows that we're seeing are coming from this new usage. One of the new usage is as you cite is that ETFs became cheaper to use than futures. So we've seen a lot of institutions now as they become aware of that and we know how to talk about it, they are coming to us and asking us how they can use ETFs to better express their views in the marketplace. So we're seeing flows coming in from that as well as just a generic core. And as you know, the two segments are certainly the buy and hold segment and we have introduced the core ETFs for that and we're seeing growths in \u2013 growth in that to the tune of $3.8 billion, which is a 7% organic growth in the quarter. So we're very excited as that continues to grow.","But at the same time, we're seeing those who are utilizing those for trading activities to express their views continue to grow as well. And a lot of that is in the high yield area, where they're expressing their views, positive or negative, so you see flows in that. And then you just see people that are actually looking at ETFs as a replacement also for their mutual fund business as well.","So I think there is lots of opportunities in this. We're just beginning to scratch the surface and new uses for this. We continue to think that it's going to continue to grow going forward, and we want to be the innovator using ETFs to innovate and to solve people's issues in their portfolios.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. And just in the quarter, I guess, the lower flows on the institutional side is more of a beta issue than anything structural that you're seeing?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we actually had good flows in the active side, and obviously, institutional side was all related to those beta stories that I discussed previously.","Brian B. Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, great. And then just a follow-up, Larry, maybe on the Department of Labor proposed rules on how do you think that might impact allocations in the 401(k) plans longer-term, and what it might mean for your target-date business if that's another catalyst for that business?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We shared the Department of Labor's goals in promoting better retirement and security. This is one of the big issues and we've been stressing. I do believe our retirement \u2013 our inadequacy in retirement is going to be the big story in the coming years. I do believe the elevated savings rates that we're just seeing so far in the first six months, possibly could be related to people starting to become more aware that they have an inadequate retirement plan. So, we will be vigilant and outspoken on retirement issues.","Look, related to specifically your question, the need of investors are going to be differing, we all want good investment outcomes, and we need to make sure that we, as an industry, provide client choice \u2013 hopefully client choice with low cost. Cost is \u2013 it can't be primary because we have to be outcome-focused, obviously, outcome-focused with cost is the emphasis, not the other way around.","So the DoL's indicated interest for our comments, we submitted the commentary, we're going to have to see, wait and see how this all plays out. I think \u2013 I don't believe we understand or have enough information to know how this will all play out. I think this will be evolving, but we are working constructively with the DoL, and whatever they determine, we'll \u2013 I'll be able to tell you in the coming quarters how that will play out for BlackRock and the impact. On the surface, it's going to have \u2013 it has impact on BlackRock, if it is as it is today, because it has impact on some of our distribution platforms, but we'll be able to navigate that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chris.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Quick question on your retail business. Clearly, it's been a great performer for you guys for quite a long while now, your top five. Just wondering at this point, what additional opportunities do you see for that part of your business? And really, I'm wondering due to the fact that your share has seemingly gone up quite a lot, just wondering if incremental gains at this point might be a little bit harder to come by?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Three years ago, four years ago, we started talking about our building out of retail. Three years and four years ago we started talking about building a stronger brand in retail. Two years ago, we integrated our retail and our iShares teams to be \u2013 to offer more outcome-oriented solutions that are \u2013 instead of just product pushing. And I think this has all created a more elevated position with our distribution platform.","And I believe we have much more to go. We are still way behind other firms related to the RIAs. We still have deeper penetration to go with some of the big distribution platforms. And importantly, I believe because of our technology \u2013 because of Aladdin, I think we can provide better models from \u2013 to assisting our distribution partners in creating better models, better advice, and if we can continue to help our distribution platforms to be better at what they do, combination of beta products and alpha products, maybe with liquid alts, we should enjoy higher penetration of wallet, and I believe, we're just beginning on that path.","Chris M. Harris - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Craig \u2013 operator, we have time \u2013 we have 10 more minutes. So, if there is no one behind, Craig, we could carry on.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I think so I will get started here. So...","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","First, just on active ETFs. I'm wondering, do you guys have plans to launch some of your active products into a transparent ETF structure? And also, do you think your competition will more aggressively pursue this option just given the lack of non-transparent ETF options today?","Robert S. Kapito - President","Yeah, so, we've looked at this, we continue to look at this, and right now collectively, we're not sure that this is going to be a big opportunity in the marketplace. One of the benefits of the ETFs is the transparency, the diversification, and that enhances the trading and the liquidity of these. So, we're not sure that this is an opportunity we're going to pursue. We're thinking about it, and we'll just see how the market continues to evolve. So, we're not ruling it out, but right now, we're not looking at that, and we view that as something that will compete more directly with mutual funds than it will with the normal ETFs.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would \u2013 once again, I think I've said in the past. I think there's way too much emphasis on this product. We have said that we believe the ETF industry is going to go from a $3 trillion to $6 trillion industry. Active ETFs will be a component of it, but it will be dwarfed by the industry's growth in traditional beta products. Where you may see ETFs grow is really more based on model or smart beta products, so where you're going to have tilts, but I still don't see active ETF playing a large role in the totality of the market, and I agree with Rob. If there is growth in it, it's going to be growth that's going to be taking away more growth from traditional mutual funds.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And if I can just squeeze one follow-up here. I heard your commentary on the RIA market and how you'd like to increase market share there, but as demographics increasingly become difficult for 401(k) plans, what is your plan to increase your market share in the RIA segment?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I said the RIA \u2013 they were independents, not the \u2013 not IRIS, but I was talking about the independent advisor. So Craig, I'm not sure \u2013 I did not make a statement related that define (54:37) contribution on IRIS...","Gary S. Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Managing Director","I think he's talking about RIAs.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But RIAs, we had very weak penetration three years, four years ago. We had very little visibility with many of the RIAs, and these are \u2013 we have to become a trusted partner. There are some other firms that have had a long-standing trusted relationship with these independent channels, and I \u2013 we are very pleased with the growth that we have in our RIA channel in 2015. And I expect, as I said earlier, that we're going to build more share because I do believe we can become another trusted advisor to their channels.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ken Hill with Barclays.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ken?","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions. You guys have a really nice story to tell on the fixed income market as ETFs play a greater role in supplying liquidity in what has otherwise been a pretty illiquid corporate bond market. When you think about the dynamics of ETFs playing a larger role longer-term, is there anything in there that you're particularly concerned about as these passive products grow as a percentage of the market? Do you think that really increases your regulatory bullseye here? And while it's still a relatively small piece of the market now, do you think there's a natural cap on how much of the market ETFs can make up?","Robert S. Kapito - President","So, our view of ETFs is a bit different. We think it actually enhances the liquidity of the markets because of the transparency. So you know what the underlying securities are. So there is a market in those. And then there's a market of those as a whole. And in periods of volatility, we've actually seen very little creation or redemption of any of those assets. We've actually seen the ETFs trade themselves.","So, we think it enhances the liquidity. And, therefore, we think this market could continue to grow. So, we don't really \u2013 I wouldn't agree with you on illiquidity in the corporate bond market. It's just that it's been more one-sided because there's more demand right now. So there really isn't a large secondary market. I don't call that illiquid, I call that overdemand for yield securities because of the environment. So if interest rates rise, that will change a bit, but we think that this has been providing good opportunity in the marketplace, and just think of how large the fixed income market is, and when you take a look at that, any percentage, any small percentage increase in ETF, so the fixed income market is going to be very substantial and very large. So, we're very bullish on the future of ETFs and how large they can grow relative to the fixed income market.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But, let's just talk about market dynamics a little bit. So, ETFs are far more liquid and constructive versus a mutual fund. An ETF throughout the day has a buyer that matches with a seller. So every time you have a buyer matching a seller during the time, the underlying assets are not traded. And so, this is one of the \u2013 people don't understand \u2013 when they talk about this, they just not talk about the market dynamics. So for every buyer, there's a seller. You are not creating or redeeming the underlying assets. So for \u2013 during the market opening, the ETF is providing more liquidity. When you think about a mutual fund, a mutual fund in bonds is accumulating buys and sells throughout the day, and at the final \u2013 end of the day, they find out if they have to sell the underlying stocks or \u2013 excuse me, bonds at the end of the day or the next morning to get the cash. So, the ETF actually is, as Rob suggested, a provider of liquidity. It also creates a transparency of where the markets are, and it's \u2013 this is another surprise to me on the narrative, the narrative that you are able to transact bond sales and purchases in mass by utilizing one stock \u2013 you're able to reduce the underlying assets and the need for a lot of sales bonds, a lot of purchases bonds intra-day, and that's a major component of why ETFs are additive to the liquidity and more importantly, they create transparency. And we've been telling this story for years, we witnessed it. The Federal Reserve actually came out with a research report \u2013 this is more related to emerging market equities, on the same construct that it provided liquidity. So we're still dismayed at the narrative.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to imply that ETFs were part of the problem. I was just talking about dealer inventory levels and a relatively illiquid corporate bond market.","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, keep in mind, I don't know how dealers report because this is a stock. More and more dealers are big market makers in ETFs. And if it's under the equity desk, a bond ETF, because it's an equity, that's a major component of the business today.","Kenneth W. Hill - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Okay. I appreciate all the color there. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning and for your continued interest at BlackRock. Once again, our second quarter highlighted the investments we made over many years to enhance the differentiated platform that we have \u2013 a platform that's diverse, a platform that's global, a platform that can work in both alpha and beta products. And I believe the second quarter was a good testimony to all that buildup. We continue to take a long-term view and hopefully, we're staying ahead of our clients' needs. And most importantly, as I suggested, when we have 3,000 clients calling in to \u2013 BlackRock Institute call, we're winning more and more hearts and minds of our clients, which in my \u2013 our deepest hope, that leads to larger share of their wallet. And if we continue to do that, we'll continue to drive performance for our shareholders in a landscape that is obviously very volatile.","Everyone have a good quarter, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3567":["BlackRock Inc.

My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated fourth quarter and full year 2018 earnings teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lawrence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer period. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Good morning everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC. The results of BlackRock could differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks Chris. Good morning and happy new year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2018.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. ","As a reminder for one last time, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter and full-year results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB\u2019s revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1, 2018. ","In 2018, BlackRock delivered positive organic asset and base fee growth, increased year-over-year revenue, and expanded our operating margin while also maintaining an investment mindset and returning significant cash to shareholders. Our performance was sustained by the investments we have continuously made to leverage our scale and optimize our strategic positioning. We generated $123 billion of long-term net inflows during the year, representing 2% organic asset and 2% organic base fee growth, and achieved these results despite $92 billion of low fee institutional indexed equity outflows associated with client de-risking and a volatile equity market. ","The stability of our operating model allowed us to continue to invest in high growth opportunities such as retirement, illiquid alternatives, ETFs, and factors. We also continued to extend our leadership in technology and lead the industry shift from product selection to portfolio construction, all while simultaneously expanding our full-year operating margin by 20 basis points to 44.3%. After investing for growth, we returned approximately $3.6 billion of cash to our shareholders during the year, an increase of over 30% from 2017.","The strength of BlackRock\u2019s diversified global investment and technology platform enabled us to continue to execute against our framework for long-term growth despite meaningful headwinds for the asset management industry. Global equity indices declined more than any year since the financial crisis, and almost every asset class but cash posted negative returns. U.S. and European ETF both declined 38% in 2018 and global active mutual funds saw outflows accelerate to record levels by year-end. ","As BlackRock has historically demonstrated, environments like this create opportunities for growth as long as we have the discipline to realize them. Executing on this vision, however, requires that we move decisively to focus more limited resources where the impact will be greatest and make difficult decisions to reallocate in challenging markets. We view our ability to continue playing offense as critical to positioning us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future.","With that in mind, we recently undertook a restructuring to free up investment capacity for our most important growth opportunities by modifying the size and shape of our workforce. This resulted in a fourth quarter restructuring charge of $60 million primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 500 impacted employees or 3% of our global workforce. This charge appears as a single-line expense item on our 2018 GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results.","For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $3.4 billion and operating income of $1.3 billion, down 9% and 12% respectively from a year ago. Nonetheless, full year revenue of $14.2 billion was up 4% versus 2017 and operating income of $5.5 billion increased 5%. Earnings per share of $26.93 was up 20% versus 2017, reflecting the impact of a lower effective tax rate in 2018. ","Non-operating expense for the quarter totaled $72 million, reflecting lower marks on unhedged seed capital investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 21%. We currently estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation. ","Fourth quarter base fees of $2.8 billion were down 4% year over year despite positive organic base fee growth over the period and the impact of recent acquisitions, reflecting the negative effects of beta and FX and lower borrowing demand for securities lending in the current quarter. Full-year base fees were up 6% for 2018 but we entered 2019 with an annualized base fee run rate approximately 6% lower than last year as a result of significant global equity market declines, which reduced BlackRock\u2019s AUM by approximately $500 billion [ph] in the fourth quarter alone.","Fourth quarter performance fees of $100 million declined 65% year over year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternatives and long-only products in a very challenging year for the hedge fund industry. Underperformance during the fourth quarter will also impact performance fees for 2019 as certain quarterly and annual locking funds are below high watermarks entering the year. While we\u2019re seeing significant growth in our illiquid alternatives business, performance fees from these products are generally not booked until capital is returned to clients and represent a source of meaningful longer term future growth.","Quarterly technology services revenue grew 15% year over year, driving record full-year technology services revenue of $785 million as an outsized number of new institutional Aladdin clients went live in 2018, and we expanded our range of digital wealth and distribution technologies. We continue to target low to mid-teens growth in technology services revenue over the longer term. ","Total expense increased 4% in 2018 driven primarily by higher G&A expense, volume-related expense, and compensation. Fourth quarter G&A expense was up 9% sequentially primarily due to planned seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend. Similar to the third quarter, the current quarter also included $31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments. This was primarily related to improved expectations of achieving specified performance targets on prior acquisitions and lowered quarterly as-adjusted operating margin by approximately 100 basis points. ","G&A expense increased 13% in 2018, reflecting higher planned levels of technology, data, and marketing spend. Approximately 50% of the year-over-year increase in G&A expense was comprised of non-core items such as deal, tax, Brexit-related professional fees, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, and FX re-measurement expense. While we continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, we would currently expect 2019 G&A expense to be essentially flat to our core level of spend in 2018.","Direct fund expense was up $103 million or 12% in 2018, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of growth in our iShares franchise. For the full year, compensation expense increased $68 million or 2%, primarily reflecting higher headcount and higher operating income offset by lower levels of performance fees. Our full-year comp-to-revenue ratio of 34.4% declined 110 basis points versus 2017. The decline was primarily associated with lower performance fees, the impact of ongoing technology investments, and successful implementation of our iHub strategy. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full-year basis.","We see significant opportunities to better serve clients in this environment and BlackRock remains committed to investing in key growth areas. As evidenced by our recent restructuring, we are always margin aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible. ","Away from the P&L, we also prudently used our balance sheet to position the business for continued success. During 2018, we allocated $1.2 billion of new seed or co-investment capital to our products, resulting in a net increase to our total portfolio of approximately $500 million. We closed the strategic acquisitions of Citibanamex Asset Management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico, and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. In addition, we continued to expand our technology portfolio with minority investments in Acorns, the country\u2019s fastest-growing micro-investing app, and Envestnet, a leading provider of intelligent systems for wealth management and financial wellness. ","We remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through our combination of dividends and share repurchases. We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion worth of shares in 2018, including $525 million in the fourth quarter as we sought to take advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities in the current market environment. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased almost $7 billion of BlackRock stock, reducing our outstanding total shares by 7%. ","At present, based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions, including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate share repurchases aggregating at least $1.2 billion during 2019. In addition, consistent with our predictable and balanced approach to capital management, our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $3.30 per share, representing an increase of 5% over the current level.","BlackRock is having deeper and more strategic conversations with a greater number of clients than ever before, even as many clients are deferring investment decisions and de-risking in the face of an uncertain market landscape. Fourth quarter long-term net inflows of $44 billion representing 3% annualized organic AUM and base fee growth were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies, and illiquid alternatives partially offset by continued outflows from lower fee institutional indexed equities. Global iShares generated $168 billion of net inflows for the year, representing 10% organic growth for 2018. Importantly, we saw momentum into year-end as seasonal tax planning, growth in fee-based wealth management, and demand for efficient exposure supported by significant market liquidity generated back-to-back record net inflow months in November and December. Fourth quarter iShares net inflows of $81 billion represented our highest flow quarter on record and an annualized organic growth rate of 18%. ","Forty-nine iShares ETFs had over $1 billion in net inflows in 2018, and we once again captured the number one industry share of global, U.S., European, equity and fixed income ETF flows for the year. Strength in the iShares core continued in 2018 with $106 billion of net inflows, almost twice that of the next largest player, representing approximately 45% share of industry for ETF flows. Equally important, during the fourth quarter about 60% of iShares net flows were in higher fee ETFs, including financial instruments and precision exposures outside the core. ","BlackRock generated full-year retail net inflows of $21 billion in a challenging year for the mutual fund industry, which experienced historic outflows in December. BlackRock\u2019s inflows were led by our broad active fixed income range, our multi-asset income fund, and liquid alternatives. Retail outflows in the fourth quarter were driven by active fixed income, reflecting industry pressures in the unconstrained and high yield categories where we have significant market share. Unconstrained products were impacted by the volatile rate environment as investors shifted into short duration mutual funds and ETFs. High yield and emerging market debt funds experienced outflows driven by risk-off sentiment and credit. ","BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated 2% organic base fee growth for the year, reflecting strength in illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions, and liability driven investment strategies despite almost $100 billion of low fee indexed equity outflows and elevated active fixed income outflows, which reflected several large client redemptions associated with client M&A, cash repatriation, and manager consolidation. In a record year for our illiquid alternatives business, BlackRock now has approximately $23 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of illiquid strategies, representing almost $170 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time. ","Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform continues to increase share by leveraging scale and delivering transformative distribution and risk management technology through both Cachematrix and Aladdin. While full year 2018 net inflows were impacted by two large planned redemptions totaling almost $40 billion, bas fees grew 9%. ","In summary, our diversified business model once again delivered differentiated organic growth, record technology services revenue, operating leverage, and significant capital return in 2018. We are committed to continuously evolving, investing in and disrupting our platform to benefit client needs. We believe BlackRock\u2019s platform is as well positioned as ever to meet client needs and deliver long-term value for shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Fink","Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and happy new year. BlackRock\u2019s performance in 2018 reflects the deeper partnerships we are building with clients through our solution-based approach. We have consistently and strategically invested to create the most diverse global asset management and technology services firm in the world, and we\u2019re having more comprehensive conversations with more clients today than any time in our history. Our ability to deliver investment strategies from ETFs to alternatives to our industry-leading portfolio construction and risk management technology, and our historic deep capital markets expertise through the BlackRock Investment Institute is what differentiates BlackRock and helps us with our clients worldwide.","The diversity of our platform is reflected in our results. We generated $124 billion of net inflows in 2018 despite, as Gary discussed, over $90 billion of low fee institutional indexed equity outflows as some of our clients, many of whom are global, de-risked against a difficult market backdrop. Seven different countries and 59 different products each generated more than a billion dollars of net inflows. Our Aladdin and Digital Wealth technologies are accessible to clients now in more than 50 different countries, including thousands of wealth advisors who serve millions of end investors. ","2018 was marked by heightened uncertainty about the future. Political, economic and social outlooks globally remain clouded and unclear, which resulted in extreme periods of volatility in the financial markets. For only the second time in nearly 30 years, annual market returns were negative in both global bonds and in equities. Throughout the year and particularly in the fourth quarter, U.S. rate policy, tightening financial conditions, and a deepened concern regarding economic growth and corporate profitability dragged down equity performance throughout all the world indexes. The impact of a weak growth backdrop on European markets was exacerbated by concerns over the Italy budget deficits, the outlook for Brexit, the rising populism in France, and governmental changes and populism in Spain. ","For most of the year, the emerging market was impacted by a stronger dollar, by trade tensions, a developing anxiety with slower growth in China, and other country-specific risks continue to put asset prices and currencies under pressure. Sentiment shifted from cautious to negative, which impacted investor behaviors amongst institutions and individuals, and 2019 began with many clients de-risking and sitting on cash, waiting for greater market certainty. ","A year ago, rising market volatility and filing correlations suggested an environment where the investment industry\u2019s traditional active equity strategies were primed to deliver alpha. Not only did that not happen in 2018 but once again the industry under-performed in their equity returns, and what we witnessed, especially in the fourth quarter, industry outflows hit a record level especially as taxable investors took the opportunities to harvest losses. ","What we are seeing more than ever before, and we believe this trend is going to continue and this trend will continue to benefit BlackRock, we are seeing clients are fundamentally questioning the composition of their portfolios. The industry is shifting form an approach of picking products or stocks to one of building portfolios. As a result, both clients\u2019 needs and our industry are changing rapidly. This all along has been BlackRock\u2019s approach - a focus on client outcomes and building better portfolios to help clients achieve better outcomes. Our strength in this area driven by our diverse investment platform and our portfolio construction technology will lead to future organic growth for BlackRock. ","We\u2019re seeing an acceleration of barbelling in client portfolios with index and ETFs and factors on one hand, and illiquid alternatives on the other hand. The demand has never been greater for technology to manage risk and build more resilient portfolios. BlackRock always has been willing to aggressively embrace change. We have strategically invested in our business over time to build strength in ETFs, in our alternative business, and our world-leading technology business, and the benefits of these investments are clear. In the fourth quarter, we saw record flows in iShares, record flows in the commitment of our illiquid alternatives, and record levels of technology services revenues.","BlackRock generated $10 billion of net inflows in our core alternative business in 2018, more than a tenfold increase from the year before. Flows reflected strong fundraising and the successful deployment of capital. We now manage more than $80 billion in committed and invested capital for our clients across platforms of infrastructure, credit, real estate, and private equity strategies. ","Our institutional client rebalancing survey suggests that in 2019, institutions including pensions and insurance companies in particular are anticipating allocating more assets to illiquid strategies. As demand increases, BlackRock is well positioned to generate differentiated growth in this strategic high growth asset class by leveraging the benefits of our technology, our global reach, and our scale. ","At the other end of the barbell, ETFs are playing an even greater role in client portfolios, and BlackRock is leading the industry. Fourth quarter was the strongest in iShares history with $81 billion of net inflows, driven by records in November and December. We continue to see growth in January, with about $13 billion of flows. More and more clients are choosing ETFs as a preferred investment vehicle because of their superior structure relative to the mutual fund industry, including liquidity and, most importantly, tax efficiency. Clients who faced large tax bills while their equity mutual funds delivered negative active returns experienced this firsthand and shifted to ETFs in the fourth quarter. Institutional clients are using ETFs express risk-on, risk-off views, tactical asset allocation decisions, and our distribution partners also are recognizing iShares as a technology to white label as part of their broader solutions. We believe white labeling iShares, as we are doing this with RBC in Canada, will lead to much greater opportunities with more distribution partners going forward worldwide. ","Growth in iShares will continue to be driven by long term secular tailwinds. The trends towards efficient, transparent, low-cost vehicles is accelerating the adoption of iShares\u2019 core funds, as Gary mentioned. Three of the industry\u2019s top four ETFs in terms of net new assets this year were iShares core ETFs: our IVV, our S&P fund; IEFA, a fund for developed international market exposures, and IEMG, our core emerging market fund. But this movement to greater efficiencies, transparency and simplicity in portfolios extends well beyond core. We extended our lead in fixed income ETFs with inflows into shorter duration strategies towards year end as clients took a more defensive posture. iShares\u2019 factor ETFs also had record inflows this year with client demand for minimum volatility funds increasing in the fourth quarter, making us a leader in the factor ETF and in the factor investing more broadly.","Our sustainable strategies are seeing new demand from investors from around the world. Fixed income factors and sustainable iShares saw a record of $68 billion of net inflows in 2018, representing organic growth of 16%. I believe we are at the early stages of growth in each of those categories. ","We estimate ESG ETF assets globally will grow by $400 billion in the next decade, and we are investing in our product range, our portfolio tools, and data disclosures to lead in that category. We generated $3 billion of net inflows into our sustainable iShares funds globally in 2018, more than double our results from 2017. During the fourth quarter, BlackRock launched the iShares sustainable core to enable investors to combine purpose and performance as the core of their portfolios. ","We are also making iShares more accessible, especially in the wealth management landscape. We announced last week the strategic alliance with RBC Global Asset Management to offer Canadian investors 150 ETFs under the RBC iShares brand. This alliance enhances BlackRock\u2019s ability to serve Canadian wealth management through RBC\u2019s distribution strength and innovation in index, factors, and active ETFs. ","One of the main drivers of ETF flows among wealth clients has been the adoption of managed portfolios. We expect this to continue but we actually expect this to be growing and providing greater force, and also providing much more global scale. Managed portfolios provide advisors with asset allocation solutions across the risk spectrum, populated with transparent low cost, tax efficient funds which help them scale their practice while meeting their clients\u2019 goals. This is increasing the need for strategic asset management partnerships that can offer a range of investment, portfolio construction, and technology solutions. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly over the many quarters, no organization can provide that to the wealth management sector of having investment, portfolio construction, and technology solutions all together, and it is that uniqueness that gives us the opportunity to build our relationship with more and more wealth management organizations.","BlackRock is the most comprehensive partner for wealth managers looking to build better, more resilient portfolios for investors. We have the building blocks, the portfolio construction expertise and the digital capabilities, including Aladdin Wealth and Advisor Center. We launched Aladdin Wealth at Morgan Stanley in the fourth quarter, reaching 16,000 financial advisors. We also announced a strategic partnership with Envestnet, connecting BlackRock to more than 93,000 independent financial advisors on their platform. BlackRock\u2019s differentiated ability to provide wealth management with sophisticated technology drove retail inflows of $21 billion for the year, in contrast to the broad large-scale outflows that the mutual fund industry saw. ","Our focus on technology is benefiting us in other areas of our business, like cash management. With cash becoming a more attractive asset class as rates rise, BlackRock\u2019s cash management strategies are becoming an increasing important part of our clients\u2019 portfolios. Our technology-first distribution strategy is resonating and we saw a 9% increase year over year in growth in our base fees. BlackRock\u2019s cash platform is differentiated by our scale, our integrated Cachematrix technology, our risk management, and our unique ability to create tailored liquidity solutions. ","Aladdin and Wealth Technology not only is driving accelerated flows for our investment products but also consistent technology services revenues for the firm. Nineteen percent annual growth was driven by a strong year of institutional Aladdin implementations. Industry consolidated and regulatory requirements, among other trends, are driving more demand for more holistic, flexible technology solutions, and BlackRock\u2019s technology platform is very well positioned to capitalize on the growing needs by more institutions seeking this type of technology.","We recently announced an exciting collaboration with Microsoft to address the growing retirement challenges in the U.S. We are combining Microsoft\u2019s technology strengths with BlackRock\u2019s investment capabilities to jointly explore next-generation retirement solutions. Our goal is simplifying the saving process and enabling people to make better investment decisions that lead to secure financial futures, and there will be much more to talk about in the future. We believe we will be able to grow considerably in our retirement solution business going forward with this partnership that we have with Microsoft and the new types of digital solutions that we\u2019re going to be able to provide.","Everything we are doing reflects our focus on the long term. This focus helps keep us ahead of the changes in the market, staying in front of the needs of our clients and making sure that we\u2019re staying in front of our industry. It helps us prepare to solve our clients\u2019 most pressing investment challenges and it guides our investments in our own business so that we are efficiently providing the full breadth of BlackRock\u2019s capabilities and our scale for our clients, for our employees, and for our shareholders. ","It is this focus on the long term that drives us to reshape our organization and make difficult but necessary decisions that position us for the best possible path forward. As Gary mentioned, our restructuring effort resulted in a number of valued colleagues and friends leaving the firm, and we greatly appreciate the contributions they made to BlackRock. ","BlackRock\u2019s focus remains on the long term and how we can best serve our clients over time. We see tremendous opportunities for our firm and industry that will require us to aggressively embrace change and continue to evolve as an organization. We\u2019re looking at every aspect of how we operate and how we manage the organization. We are moving people into new roles to fully leverage their talents. We are leveraging our technology in new ways and we are making sure that our scale, which is a key competitive advantage, remains a benefit and gives us that unique ability to work with our clients. ","BlackRock\u2019s differentiated platform showed resilience. We generated net inflows and increased revenues and increased operating income while investing for our future growth, which is essential in creating long-term value for our clients and long-term value for our shareholders. We will continue to strategically invest in BlackRock. We will target those areas where we see the highest future growth potential. The ecosystem that we operate in is shifting from product selection to a whole portfolio approach, the digitization of asset management, and achieving scale in high growth markets around the world so that we can better deliver outcomes for our clients, opportunities for our employees, and strong consistent returns for our shareholders. ","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. ","Larry Fink","Hi Alex, good morning.","Alex Blostein","Hi Larry, good morning everybody. First question around just the strength in the iShares business, and particularly I was hoping to kind of zone in on the events of late December. You guys have seen considerable strength there in light of--despite, actually I should say, de-risking and substantial outflows from mutual funds. Any additional color you could provide there would be helpful, just to think about how the customer base reacted in the utilization of the product in what I would imagine would have been more of a risk-off scenario.","Larry Fink","Sure, I\u2019ll let Rob start it off and I may conclude that answer.","Rob Kapito","So we saw, obviously as you heard Larry say, strong iShares flows in the fourth quarter, but this year the activity was very high because of people that wanted to take risk off, do more tax efficient trades, and what they looked to do is to move out of their current products into a more defensive product, and it made a lot of sense. They moved primarily into short-duration product and, more importantly, they moved into precision products that are of course higher fee, like EEM and HYG. This was done in larger volume than I think anyone would have expected. 81 billion inflows is the highest flow quarter in iShares history, and it was broad - $61 billion went into equities even as the equity market fell dramatically, which should answer questions about how ETFs will perform in a volatile and bear market, we had no instances of any issues or anybody had any issues with liquidity; $19 billion in fixed income, and $2 billion in multi-asset and alternative ETFs. So this was an important way for our clients to get defensive very quickly, to utilize the tax efficiency which is a very important feature of this wrapper versus a mutual fund, and to quickly use the liquidity in the market when, as you know, in the equity markets there was a lot of issue with liquidity, especially in late December.","So they performed as we would have expected and as we predicted. The use of them was some of the best features of iShares, and we were the beneficiary of that volatility, and even though we may have had outflows in other areas, the benefit of having such a diversified portfolio is that we were able to capture the outflows back in inflows in different areas and different products, and as Gary mentioned a lot of those went to actually the higher fee ETFs that we have.","Larry Fink","Let me add a little bit more, Alex. I truly believe it\u2019s becoming more recognized, the superior nature of the ETF structure versus a mutual fund. We\u2019ve heard many instances in which--many mutual funds who had negative NAV at the end of the year, but they also had capital gains taxes that they were identifying to their clients, and their clients in many cases just got quite aggravated by paying taxes with a negative NAV. Obviously with an ETF, you control your tax basis, and I think this is becoming a bigger and bigger issue. Navigating for the long term your tax position for taxable individuals and institutions is very important.","We also believe the movement in the wealth management space away from stocks and products, navigating more towards models and portfolio construction, we are seeing elevated and continually elevated flows into ETFs. We think that trend is beginning. It wasn\u2019t something that was short in nature. We believe that will continue throughout 2019 and maybe \u201920, and this is one of the reasons why we continue to believe the ETF industry is going to continue to grow very largely, and I think the big surprise in the fourth quarter, as you suggest, was in a very volatile negative marketplace, you\u2019re seeing portfolio reallocations being done out of mutual funds because we had elevated mutual fund outflows as an industry and into ETFs. ","I also believe people are starting to think about ETFs more as a technology, not just a product. If you think about what makes companies really good, a lot of people ride on convenience. The convenience of ETFs versus other instruments far outweighs the other instruments, and I do believe the key towards ETFs and the convenience is now becoming an accelerant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Larry Fink","Hi Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning, Larry. I wanted to see if you could share any additional color on the large redemptions in Asia, and also the institutional equity index in just the fourth quarter, because it looks like they both could be related, and I wanted to see if it included maybe one or two very large client outflows. Also just kind of as a little follow-up here, if you can share any fee rate color on the outflows in Asia or institutional equity index, that would be helpful too.","Larry Fink","Sure, I\u2019ll let Gary begin with that and I\u2019ll follow up.","Gary Shedlin","Good morning, Craig. We clearly have been seeing accelerated activity in redemptions in our institutional index equity book. I think a couple things are important there. One is to remember that this is really a scaled offering for some of our largest institutional clients, and while institutional index equity represents roughly a quarter of our assets under management, it only accounts for 6% of our base fees. When you strip out the impact of securities lending, the average effective fee rate on that book is around three basis points.","As you correctly identify, we had fourth quarter outflows there. I would say that they were almost entirely driven by on a net basis by one large institutional client in A-Pac, and when you look at this on a full-year basis, I think there were some broader trends, really primarily linked to de-risking, asset allocation and cash needs by official institutions, primarily outside of the U.S. as well as DV plans in the U.S. Given the outflows in many cases are really from our more significant scale clients, the average fee rates on those outflows are in fact generally lower than the overall three basis point fee rate that I quoted on the general book.","But again, keeping it into broader perspective, we look at the institutional business as a broad-based business. We saw continued demand from clients for our higher fee products - illiquid alternatives, multi-asset solutions, OCIO, LDI strategies to name a few, and in fact notwithstanding those low fee institutional outflows for the year which made the net flows go negative for the year, we actually generated 2% organic base fee growth in the institutional business overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. ","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, and happy new year. ","Larry Fink","Happy new year.","Robert Lee","Thank you. Larry, I\u2019m curious - I mean, maybe you hinted at this a little bit, but as you survey and think about the kind of changing landscape out there in terms of distribution and products and how you access clients, and maybe the Microsoft partnership is an example of this, but do you think it\u2019s imperative or a need that you have direct access to the end retail investor at some point, as opposed to obviously institutions? Is that part of how you\u2019re thinking about this Microsoft partnership, is that you may be able to develop some solutions that can get you directly to the end investor instead of through intermediaries?","Larry Fink","Our business model is not changing at all. Where we believe our retirement solution business, especially with Microsoft, is going to go is working with our institutional clients through their DC plans and providing technology to assist our DC plan clients to provide the technology for them to better serve their employees. It is not for us to go direct; it is providing technology to help the companies have deeper, better connections with their employees, and one thing that we have seen, there has been a separation between the employer and the employee as defined contributions have become the dominant form of retirement. Historically when you had a defined benefit plan, there was an emotional, legal connection between the employer and employee, and in an era now of 3%-ish unemployment, whatever the level is - 3.7%, more and more companies are trying to find better connectivity with their employees to have better retention. But also, I believe going forward corporations are going to have greater responsibility and needs in terms of working with their employees to have their employees to have more confidence in their retirement plans. ","We are developing the technology and, I should say, the pipes to tech-enable our clients, not for us to go direct ourselves but to have deeper connections, and we believe having that type of pipe and technology is going to be a way that we can enhance our value chain. It certainly is going to build more opportunities to build deeper relationships and ultimately more flows. It also can connect what we\u2019re doing with Aladdin for wealth, where I believe it\u2019s going to be transformational for BlackRock over the next 10 years. That is going to allow us to have deeper connection with the financial advisor. We have already heard examples where those wealth advisors who are using Aladdin for wealth, they have been able to secure bigger assignments from their clients because they\u2019re providing their clients with better transparency of their portfolio, better risk analytics for their portfolio. ","Our job is to enable our distribution platforms. Our job is to enable our institutional clients with better pipes and technology, and that\u2019s how we believe we could generate robust opportunities which will entail better flows, but most importantly deeper and better connected relationships that will sustain ourselves over many years to come. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi.","Larry Fink","Hey Bill, happy new year.","Brian Wu","Hi, good morning. This is Brian Wu on for Bill Katz. Thank you for taking my question. Regarding the cost saving initiatives, could you provide some color on areas of potential reallocation or reinvestment of those savings, in what geographies, business lines or areas of technology you would likely focus on? Thank you.","Rob Kapito","Sure, I\u2019ll take that. I think the goal of this restructuring, as it was a couple years ago when we last took a similar approach, is in a market where we\u2019ve seen beta take over $500 billion off of our assets and obviously a significant amount of revenue off of our entry rate for the year, we continue to believe that the model that we have here really affords us the opportunity to continue to play offense. We see some amazing opportunities for growth. Our desire is to really take advantage of a marketplace where a number of participants in the industry are being forced to cut back more than they would like, and so we are doing everything we can to be as disciplined and as smart as possible to continue our growth standpoint. That obviously takes some challenges. We\u2019ve got to basically move decisively to make sure we\u2019re focusing those more limited resources where the impact will be greatest, and that\u2019s why we took the recent steps to modify the size and shape of the organization. ","Recall that we\u2019re global, so I think really everything that we\u2019re talking about and the areas that we\u2019re focused on are all entirely global, so it\u2019s less really about a geographic targeting, and in fact some of the areas that we\u2019ve identified for growth are in fact geographic in nature, like A-Pac and China in particular; but the key areas for us that we\u2019re focused on making sure we continue to invest in are ETFs, multi-asset solutions, illiquids, and technology. When we talk about technology, that\u2019s broad-based technology, that\u2019s technology in terms of Aladdin and Aladdin Wealth. In particular, it\u2019s technology to continue to help drive better investment decisions, it\u2019s technology to leverage our distribution capabilities, and obviously to continue to invest in the infrastructure and the operational efficiency of the firm.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Just on the active franchise, so active equity sales seemed to hold up really well this quarter. I think you even had retail active equity inflows despite what we all saw was a terrible fund flow quarter for the industry. You\u2019ve clearly made various changes to the active equity product both in terms of distribution and pricing, so at least on the equity side, what do you think is resonating or why did both the institutional and retail active equity businesses hold up so well? ","Then on the other side, active fixed income, we saw that sort of same challenging market environment in credit that we saw in equities, and retail and institutional investors stepped up the active fixed income outflows and I think you mentioned high yield and unconstrained on the retail side. But given the same challenging environment for both credit and equities, why did equities hold up so much better than fixed income on the active side?","Larry Fink","I\u2019m going to let Gary answer most of the question, but let me--I think what we did in our U.S. domestic equity platform resonated. We actually had good returns in many of our U.S. equity platform and that certainly created a stability that we didn\u2019t see in 2017, just the relative nature and the results of that change. We did see outflows, though, in some of our European products where we actually had core return, so I don\u2019t want to--.","We are seeing evidence of our portfolio team changes having an impact where we made changes. We still have more work to do. On the fixed income side, I think we saw elevated outflows predominantly because of the huge rally in fixed income rates in December, when we saw rates go from as high as, on the 10-year, 3.20 to the 2.60 range and I think many people were just taking profits. We saw some people get out of some fixed income active funds to go into our low duration ETFs, and so we saw asset allocation, some cannibalization. As Rob suggested, though, we actually picked up share in the fixed income side through our ETF platform, so I don\u2019t think there was one single trend that we could give specifics, other than we are starting to see positive response by the client base related to our restructuring of our U.S. equity team that Mark Wiseman did, and we had positive returns","Rob or Gary, do you want to fill it in more?","Gary Shedlin","Yes, I think--well look, on the active equities side, when you look at both fundamental and systematic, I think on the institutional side we definitely saw some lower levels of outflows for the quarter. On the retail side, I think we\u2019ve seen some benefit from our advantage series, which was part of our restructuring of our equity business about 18 months ago, which was a recognition of trying to migrate to a lower fee, more quantitative model. I think that\u2019s actually benefited us and has done very well. We\u2019ve recently launched that feature as well.","I think on the retail side more generally, though, on equities, keep in mind that there is some seasonal impact of capital gains reinvestment that we see in the quarter, that always helps the fourth quarter a little bit.","On the fixed income side, I think on the retail side we talked about some industry-wide outflows in both unconstrained and high yield, migration to the shorter duration product as well as just risk-off sentiment in high yield that basically impacted the entire industry, and obviously we have very significant market share in both of those products.","Larry Fink","But I\u2019m pleased to say in high yield, we actually had really good performance, so I think it was, as Gary just said, was a risk-off situation but as long as we continue to drive good performance, when there\u2019s risk on again, we\u2019ll benefit.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. ","Larry Fink","Good morning, Mike.","Mike Carrier","Morning. Gary, one question for you just on the expense side. Maybe just a few clarifications - just on the G&A, given that throughout 2018 there was some items in that line, when you\u2019re talking about keeping that kind of flat in this environment for 2019, just wanted to try to get a sense of what base you\u2019re thinking that comes off of. Then just from an environmental standpoint, I think in 2018 you mentioned if the environment continues as you kind of expect and the comp ratio would trend lower, so when we think about the comp ratio in 2019 and beyond, given some of the restructuring plus some of the investments that you guys are making, just wanted to get an update there on how you\u2019re thinking about navigating that.","Gary Shedlin","Sure, so on the G&A side, the way I would think about it is we referenced the fact that our G&A went up year-over-year about $200 million. I would say that in our view, about half of that are what we could consider non-budgetable-slash-manageable items, so we have FX re-measurement, we have the purchase price contingencies that are obviously more one-time in nature and have revenue hopefully associated with that going forward. We tend to have some product launch costs tied to booking costs on closed-end funds that may launch in any given year, and then last year in particular we had a number--we had some elevated professional fees as it related to some M&A deals, obviously Brexit preparations as well as tax planning across the organization. ","About 50% of that increase effectively of that $200 million, I would attribute to those non-core items, so hopefully that gives you a sense when we talk about--looking at last year, you know, my sense is that $100 million, to the extent we don\u2019t have to see that again this year, is something that we would expect to decline year-over-year. So if you\u2019re looking at it more on a full-year basis of stated last year to what we would hopefully expect this year on a more core basis, my guess is it\u2019s down in the 3% to 4% type of area. ","On the compensation, you asked a good question on compensation. We did see a decline year over year of roughly 110 basis points in comp to revenue, and as we\u2019ve mentioned, obviously that\u2019s driven in part by a continued strategy to embrace technology more broadly and to leverage our iHubs. When I talk about iHubs, we now have one in India, we have Budapest, and as you know, we\u2019re planning on getting more ramped up in Atlanta. So as we continue to leverage that, that change the shape of the organization and obviously hopefully scale benefits do the same, which tends to drive our comp to revenue down. This year, we did have lower performance fees. Lower performance fees tend on the margin to have higher comp associated with them because teams get paid and then the rest of the employees get the benefit of that, so I would say that in stable markets and over the long term, we would clearly expect our compensation as a percent of revenue to decline as a function of continued investment and increased scale in our business. ","We\u2019ve talked about that resulting in an upward bias, however in the near term I think we could see some lumpiness in that trend. Obviously beta has declined fairly significantly - we talked about going into the year with a 6% lower run rate than last year. We\u2019re obviously going to have to make sure that we protect our most important assets, which are our human capital, and we\u2019ve been making some recent growth initiatives in things like obviously acquisitions around TCP or Tennenbaum and trying to get our long term LTPC in place, which is going to require us to basically make some one-time investments of deferred comp that could run off over the next few years.","I think with that being said, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in our long term trend, but we could see a little bit of lumpiness in the near term.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Larry Fink","Thank you, Operator. Thanks again for everyone joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. I believe our 2018 results are directly linked to the investments we made over time. Results are deeply connected to our deep partnerships we have developed and built with our clients globally through our solution-based approach, and we are going to continue to leverage our differentiated scale. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in the investment and technology capabilities, and I believe it is those investments - those investments in technology, those investments in working with our clients worldwide, is going to continue to deliver value to our clients but just as importantly, value and opportunities for our shareholders. ","Have a good start of the year. It started off okay, and let\u2019s hope everyone has a very good 2018. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.","Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2017.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.","The breadth and scale of BlackRock\u2019s globally integrated investment and technology platform continue to drive strong business and financial results. The impact of the investments we have made over time and continue to make today are driving better alpha-generation, fostering stronger client partnerships and allowing us to more efficiently operate our business.","Total quarterly net inflows of $96 billion included long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth and were positive across client type, investment style and region. BlackRock has now generated over 5% long-term organic asset growth for five consecutive quarters. More importantly, we\u2019ve achieved a long-term organic base fee growth rate of 5% for the last 12 months.","Bear in mind, these long-term growth rates don\u2019t include the impact of our cash business, which has generated almost 10% growth over the last year. Record quarterly revenue of $3.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.4 billion and earnings per share of $5.92, both increased 15% versus a year ago.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 30.6%. Assuming no current year impact from potential future change in tax laws, we continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2017, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of discrete items that could arise in the future.","Third quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year\u2019s third quarter. Performance fees of $191 million increased $133 million from the prior year and $143 million sequentially, reflecting strong overall performance, more broad-based hedge fund platform and the impact of a single European hedge fund that delivered exceptional full-year performance and locks annually in the third quarter.","Technology and risk management revenue of $175 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by several clients going live on the institutional Aladdin and Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management platforms. Demand remains strong across our full range of technology and risk management capabilities with both retail intermediaries and institutional clients increasingly focused on using technology to improve portfolio construction capabilities, optimize risk management and operate more efficiently.","We continue to invest in technology and data initiatives across the firm to generate better alpha, more effectively service existing clients and leverage our global distribution capabilities. Whether investing through the income statement, the inorganic opportunities like FutureAdvisor or Cachematrix are using our balance sheet to make minority investments in fast-growing businesses like Scalable Capital or iCapital. Our goal is to drive profitable growth in both base fees and technology revenue.","Total expense increased 13% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher volume-related expense and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up 13% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher performance fees and higher operating income. Direct fund expense was up $34 million, or 17% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM and significant growth in our iShares franchise.","G&A expense was up $51 million, or 60% year-over-year in line with previous guidance, reflecting higher technology and data spend. Current quarter G&A expense also reflected higher professional service fees, FX remeasurement expense and increased contingent consideration fair value adjustments versus a year ago.","Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45% was up 20 basis points year-over-year and up 110 basis points sequentially. While we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, we are very margin-aware and remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.","We continue to execute our consistent capital management strategy during the quarter, repurchasing an additional $275 million in common shares and stand by our previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.","Third quarter long-term net inflows of $76 billion, representing 6% annualized organic asset growth were positive across client type, investment style and region. Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $52 billion, representing 14% annualized organic growth with strength across both core and non-core exposures.","In the one year since we repriced the core funds last October, BlackRock has recaptured more than 100% of the annual revenue impact of our investment, primarily through accelerated organic growth and expanded our total U.S. market share of net flows by over 600 basis points.","iShares equity net inflows of $33 billion reflected demand for core ETFs across both developed and emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta funds. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $18 billion reflected continued adoption of fixed income ETFs by a broader set of clients with flows led by treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds.","Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $5 billion, once again showcase the strength of our top-performing active platform and include $1 billion into unconstrained strategies, as well as strong flows into municipals, emerging market debt and total return strategies. Multi-asset flows were driven by $1 billion of flows into our multi-asset income fund.","Our institutional business generated $16 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter, positive across index and active. Institutional index net inflows of $16 billion reflected $37 billion into fixed income, driven by significant client demand for LDI strategies, partially offset by equity outflows of $20 billion, as several large clients made strategic asset allocation changes during the quarter.","Modest institutional active net inflows were driven by strong multi-asset inflows, reflecting continued demand for our LifePath target-date series and factor strategies, partially offset by active equity outflows.","Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management business saw $20 billion of net inflows during the quarter, reflecting several large client wins and reached its highest ever level of AUM. BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to invest on behalf of our clients and continued execution of our framework for shareholder value creation, differentiated organic growth, operating leverage and consistent capital return.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock generated strong results in the third quarter as our differentiated global investment and technology platform increasingly resonates with our clients, driving deeper partnerships than ever before.","Over the past year, the market environment has improved considerably. We\u2019ve seen greater political stability in Europe. China is continuing to show economic strength, and after a long period of stagnation, we\u2019re seeing consistent growth in Japan.","Overall, the world has become much more resilient. However, large cash balances remain on the sidelines, and many global institutions are invested in assets with return profiles that are not expected to meet their liabilities over time, which is creating significant demand for asset allocation and investment strategies across multiple asset classes.","In these times of greater economic certainty, there is also a greater need for people to be invested. In more than any time in history, clients are reaching out to BlackRock for advice and for solutions. We built customized solutions from our investment platform that spans indexed to illiquid alternatives. Our technology and risk management capabilities enable us and our clients to construct better portfolios, generate alpha more consistently, manage risks smarter and scale operations more efficiently.","Combined with insights of a BlackRock Investment Institute, we are able to form stronger and more differentiated partnerships with our clients, and all of this is showing up in our flows. As Gary said, BlackRock saw third quarter total net inflows of $96 billion. These flows came from both institutional and retail clients across all major regions and investment styles.","We\u2019ve now seen a total of $264 billion of flows so far this year, compared to $202 billion for all of 2016. As we deepen our relationships with clients and partners, we recognize and embrace the growing responsibility we have on a daily basis. It is an enormous responsibility and we take this seriously and we also attempt every day to achieve the responsibilities with our goals.","Gary talked about our shareholder value creation framework and organic growth as a primary driver of that framework. Our strategy for growth is centered on being a fiduciary to our clients. This means, investing to be a leader in the areas of high client demand and growth like ETFs, like liquid \u2013 illiquid alternatives. It also means investing to generate differentiated alpha for clients and to enhance our competitive advantages in Aladdin and most importantly technology and to grow our scale.","With regulation, technology and market forces transforming the ecosystem for asset and wealth management globally, BlackRock is at the forefront of change in the industry and our focus remains on the long-term for our clients worldwide.","In the U.S., there are two major shifts converging in wealth management. First, in one of the largest asset movements, fee-based advisory assets are expected to double by 2020 in the shift from brokerage to fee-based accounts. The second digital technologies are disrupting traditional wealth advisory practices, which create competition for client assets and provides leverage for fast-growing advisory practices. These trends have several major implications for our entire industry.","Value for cost is critical to advisers and asset allocation decisions. Advisers are increasingly focused on managing risk and constructing portfolios. Chief Investment Officers are taking more control over asset allocation decisions. So there\u2019s a heightened focus on repeatable systematized practices that can be scaled.","Against this backdrop, wealth managers are concentrating their business with fewer asset managers. Demand is increasingly for a strategic partnerships beyond anyone specific investment product. They\u2019re looking for partnerships with BlackRock that we can have ability to bring tremendous value to our relationships to our clients.","BlackRock has the building blocks. BlackRock has the technology, and BlackRock has the expertise to glide clients on how to effectively use our scale. Our U.S. wealth advisory sales teams have adopted digital processes to scale and deepen financial adviser engagements.","We increased engagements by 23% relative to same time last year, in part by leveraging technology. We\u2019ve held more than 15,000 virtual meetings this year from none two years ago, which has especially been productive for us to reach more advisers in our fast-growing independent channel.","Our focus on investment and wealth management technology is aligned with our investment in the ETF ecosystem, which is increasingly driving our flows. We are creating new opportunities globally for clients to use ETF for asset allocation and alpha-generation. We\u2019re developing new products, we\u2019re spending time on ETF education across the industry and BlackRock is at the forefront of the innovation in the ETF distribution side.","The investments we have made in iShares are showing real-time results. For both the third quarter and year-to-date, iShares captured the number one share of flows in the United States, in Europe and globally. Usage is increasingly across client types from wealth clients seeking low-cost exposures and fee-based advisory models to ensure asset managers, banks, pensions, sovereign wealth funds using ETFs alongside, individual stocks, alongside bonds, future swaps as a necessary component of their portfolios.","We\u2019re similarly seeing growth across all our key product segments. We\u2019ve seen $58 billion of flows into fixed income ETFs over the past year and continue to see growth in our core, in our financial instruments, in our factors and our smart beta and ESG.","In alpha-seeking strategies, we\u2019re focused on generating consistent performance for our clients. We believe that revitalization of our active equity platform this year will drive better client outcomes and future growth for BlackRock. We\u2019re seeing early signs of progress with 81% of fundamental and 90% of scientific active equity assets are above our benchmarks or peer mediums now for three years.","Growth we\u2019re seeing across our platform is a direct result of the investments we made over time to position ourselves ahead of our client needs. We invested to build our infrastructure business beginning with a lift out of a small renewable team in 2011. Today, as a result of both organic growth and acquisitions, our global infrastructure team of nearly 150 professionals manages $16 billion of invested and committed assets across a diverse set of equity and debt infrastructure strategies.","Last year, we invested $75 million into our iShares Core shares to drive growth at a time when we anticipated these significant changes in our ecosystem. With industry flows at record highs, we have recaptured more than 100% of the revenue impact of our investment and grew our share of flow from 25% in 2016 prior to our repositioning last October to 41% market share over the past year.","Technology is increasingly significant growth driver for our business. Importantly, technology that enhances distribution and alpha-generation is driving increased flows our base fees and performance fees. We\u2019re also growing our direct technology and risk management revenues, which increased by 15% year-over-year.","One example that tech investment is Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management. After the idea was born of an internal employee innovation competition, we quickly built it into a business to drive value for our clients. Less than two years later, Aladdin Risk for Wealth has nearly 75 dedicated employees and five clients have gone live on our platform. Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and other digital offerings and partnerships like iRetire, FutureAdvisor, iCapital, Scalable Capital are reaching tens of thousands of financial advisers who manage assets on behalf of millions of end investors.","As our digital offerings enable financial adviser to have a more productive conversation with our clients, they\u2019re driving more growth in our iShares and other BlackRock investment strategies. We invested in our cash management business, both organically and through acquisition to strengthen our platforms, to leverage our scale and drive incremental growth. We\u2019ve grown assets by 70% over the last five years without significantly increasing our expense base.","In the third quarter, we saw $20 billion of net inflows into cash management strategy and now manage more than $400 billion in cash. Our long-term strategy of anticipating change and investing for growth is clearly working. Areas that we focused on today like factors, ESG, illiquid alternatives and digital wealth management are some of the areas that will definitely be driving growth for our future. It is critical that we continue to invest in these opportunities, while being mindful of the impact of our bottom line. This will continue to position BlackRock as a right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future.","No firm in our industry is better positioned to take advantage of the scale to invest in the futures of our clients. This is and will be our biggest competitive advantage in building strong relationships with our clients and driving growth in our business. If we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, BlackRock will remain positioned to deliver a differentiated growth and a differentiated financial results, and that\u2019s why we continue to believe in our future.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone.","Laurence Fink","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler","So my first \u2013 well, actually, my question is on Aladdin. When you think about future revenue growth in Aladdin on a dollar basis, how should we think about the mix of revenue growth between the legacy operating system Provider Aladdin for custody banks and in the retail advisor offering including FutureAdvisor and Aladdin Risk for Wealth? Because I\u2019m just really trying to evaluate the medium-term opportunity between these various offerings?","Laurence Fink","We see \u2013 well, that\u2019s a great question. I don\u2019t know all the answers to that question, because some of this is just being introduced today. But we expect significant growth opportunities for Aladdin. I feel very confident, we\u2019re going to continue to have double-digit growth. In our core business, we are seeing great interest from institutional clients worldwide. It is still our biggest driver in that revenue column.","What is very interesting also, we\u2019re seeing opportunities from existing Aladdin clients specifically in fixed income. We\u2019re now \u2013 are now taking on Aladdin for equity. So we are now becoming even larger component with those clients that have already experienced the Aladdin environment. They\u2019ve seen the success in terms of their own operation and they\u2019re now expanding it into other asset categories.","We now are seeing more interest from, what I would say, our core pension and insurance clients and from global asset managers throughout the world. So the foundational business is continuing to drive much of the success for Aladdin and we expect that to continue and grow as I \u2013 we said double-digit.","Provider Aladdin, we\u2019re in the testing phase right now, where we\u2019re \u2013 Aladdin provider has been put on to the custodial banks. We are working very closely with them on that. And hopefully, we believe that\u2019s not going to be a \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s a revenue driver as the custodian banks put it on. But let me also be clear on it, it creates greater efficiencies for us.","By having Provider Aladdin, a seamless block chain, which is a private block chain between us and our custodial relationships. It really creates a more seamless processing and it should reduce many, many errors. Let\u2019s assume, we have never \u2013 we won\u2019t have any more errors, we do have some. If this is successful, we expect to expand that beyond BlackRock and then use the Aladdin environment all our clients to have that same type of platform to utilize it and then it would grow significantly.","Aladdin for Wealth Management, it has a big future opportunity. As I \u2013 we said, we have now won five clients. We\u2019re now implementing those five clients. The demand is significant. What we are so pleased, we have demand from Asia, we have demand from Europe and North America. So Aladdin for Wealth Management is a very well positioned for carrying that growth that we see.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Brennan.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So I have a question on MiFID. We\u2019re here not far away from the deadline in Europe. There is a clear direction of travel, it seems for the market in funding research directly on the P&L as opposed to RPAs. What do you think though looking forward that might happen here in the U.S.? Are we going to see institutional investors begin to request similar treatment from their asset managers here, and how do you see that playing out? Thanks very much.","Laurence Fink","Well, first and foremost is the fiduciary. We\u2019re going to do whatever is going to be the best for our clients for the long run. And there\u2019s not obviously the immediate pressure related to MiFID II or of the likes of it in the United States than we have immediacy in Europe.","So we\u2019re talking to our clients. We\u2019re working with this. I would say one thing very clearly though, I\u2019m very \u2013 I think, the outcome of having us be having more responsibility of our own research is a fantastic thing. I do believe, by having more proprietary research will allow us to have more, what I would call, incremental and differentiated ideas. And so we look at this as an opportunity. We look at this as an opportunity to differentiate us. I do believe, our scale gives us unique opportunities in this too.","So we will \u2013 we are working this \u2013 working on this, we\u2019re studying this. We look at this as not just an added expense of any magnitude. We\u2019re looking at this as a opportunity and we\u2019re treating it as an opportunity and we\u2019re having dialogues with our clients. I would say, in the ecosystem, if I was nervous about MiFID II and I\u2019ve talked to regulators about this, we are worried about what the impact will be with some of the small-cap companies that that will \u2013 are having trouble, which we\u2019re hearing from many companies already and getting people to follow them. We had a conversation with a regulator yesterday about this.","I\u2019m also worried about can \u2013 are we going to see the proper research for new companies? I\u2019m not talking about the big giant IPOs that we are accustomed to, but the small IPOs that are quite small. So I think, we have to see how MiFID II works out in the European environment for us to have the strong \u2013 a real strong opinion globally. But I think the trend will be, as you clearly framed your question, is probably a movement more towards that fiduciary standard worldwide, and we\u2019ll see how this plays out.","We would like to think that over time, we have the whole ecosystem regulators, the asset management side, the sell-side, we have a better understanding how this plays out. The key \u2013 the most important point when you have these big giant regulatory issues, we need to make sure that we understand all the unanticipated changes and impacts on markets. And so, I would \u2013 we are constructive on this, but there could be some negative outcomes if it\u2019s not properly monitored and organized.","The last thing, I would just say, related to what MiFID II will be. With greater transparency, first, that\u2019s great for investors. Investors, one of my biggest worries, which I repeatedly said in these calls is, my worry about retirement worldwide. I just finished a world tour, the amount of cash that individuals are holding in bank accounts in Japan, it\u2019s $5 trillion in banking, that\u2019s with negative returns. In Europe, it\u2019s huge amounts of money sitting in bank accounts.","If we\u2019re going to move some of this money into long-term investing, because much of the savings is towards retirement. We probably would have had even more dynamic economies worldwide. So clearly, more transparency ultimately should be good for the industry, but we have the industry as a transition to go through.","And the last thing, I would say, with greater transparency, it will move more assets towards ETFs. And this is one of the big systems that I talked about in my prepared speech that I do believe, these big changes are going to move more money to manage portfolios to fee-based relationships that are going to drive more ETF flows.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Blostein","Hi, guys, good morning. I was hoping you could spend a minute on the competitive dynamics in Europe. So over the last year or so, it seems like BlackRock\u2019s retail fund flows and frankly, the market share as well had improved in the region on the active side, and that\u2019s outside of the kind of the strong position you guys have in iShares. So can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s behind the improvement and I guess your views on BlackRock\u2019s competitive position in the region into 2018, given MiFID, Brexit, FCA regulatory scrutiny, et cetera?","Laurence Fink","So it\u2019s a very important region for us obviously, and the improvement in flows is a direct relationship to the improvement in performance. In Europe, we have some of the strongest performance, and I think you\u2019ve seen that especially in our long\/short European fund.","As performance gets better, we see a lot of demand. Europe has been an important part of our roll out. We have significant resources there and investments there, and they are also participating in the growth of the ETF business in a big way, where not only do we have our ETFs, but we also have a lot of technology that we\u2019re bringing to the European markets.","So it\u2019s a very big growth area for us. We have, as you know, almost a third of our people out in Europe that we\u2019re going to continue to grow. And the other part of it is that, we believe that we need to be local in each of the countries in Europe. So we have our local sales force and we also have portfolio management, so that we can be a global company, but be local in all parts of Europe, and we\u2019re like everyone else waiting to see how the Brexit unfolds and then we\u2019re going to respond appropriately to that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Bill.","William Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate the abbreviated comments this morning as well. Couple of two-part question, if I could. First was, one of your major competitors in Europe recently embraced shifting to a sliding fee on the management fee in their global equity portfolio. I was wondering if you could talk about your reaction to that and the implications of that, particularly given what your view is greater transparency?","And then somewhat unrelated maybe for Gary. I heard term margin-aware, and that seems like a new point term, and I\u2019d like to understand what that exactly means as you think about the growth versus margin dynamic? Thanks.","Laurence Fink","Well, I\u2019ll ask Gary to answer both of those questions.","Gary Shedlin","Yes. Thank you, Larry. So, Bill, as it relates to, I think, you\u2019re referring to the fulcrum fee pricing model. I think that our view would be on this that, as the industry continues to evolve due to a variety of issues not the least of which are both regulatory and change in client trends, there are a number of active managers thinking about new ways to evolve fee structure.","So we\u2019ve seen a bunch of announcements of attentions to introduce a new performance-based model. I think, we saw one change more recently in the United States, including the fulcrum free, which is actually been in use in the U.S. for some time, but many of those details have yet to be rolled out or implemented.","I think, we continuously monitor price instructions \u2013 structures. We currently utilize both flat fee structures, as well as performance-based fee structures across our product range. We\u2019re mindful of that. That was a big driver of our decision to restructure, reposition some of our active equity businesses and launch of the low-cost advantage, suite earlier in the year. And as the landscape continues to evolve, we\u2019ll continue to explore variety of structures, including fulcrum fees and other \u2013 and frankly, other innovative structures to determine whether they\u2019re appropriate for our products and most importantly for clients.","Your second question, in terms of just the tonality of margin, I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s any change candidly. But I think, we\u2019ve been very clear historically that we don\u2019t manage the business to a margin and we\u2019re trying to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. And I just wanted people to understand that not managing, the margin doesn\u2019t actually make people understand that we\u2019re not focused on margin. And so, obviously, trying to make sure that we can do deliver the highest growth rates with the highest margins is something we\u2019re always focused on. And so I want to make sure people know that we are very margin-aware even though we may not be managing the business to a specific margin target at any point in time.","Laurence Fink","I would just echo that, we\u2019re very margin-aware. And if we see great opportunities for growth, we will interpret that and manage that accordingly. But of course, leaders of companies have to be margin-aware. We have to trade off future growth opportunities with margin, we all know that. And so I think that\u2019s what Gary really is trying to say. And it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve always said that we are \u2013 we believe that we execute our strategies properly that we could see expansion in margins. And we see great growth opportunities so that we will look at that as a trade-off. As Gary said, that has not changed, so I\u2019ll leave it at that.","Operator","Your next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello, there, how are you?","Laurence Fink","Good.","Glenn Schorr","So I heard your comments loud and clear on the recoupment of more than the investment that you\u2019ve made in the Core Series price investment. So I guess, I\u2019m looking for an update on how you can protect that kind of pricing competition outside the core, and then maybe how you evaluate it on an ongoing basis?","Laurence Fink","So, Glenn, I think we\u2019ve \u2013 historically, as we\u2019ve thought about pricing strategies in iShares, we\u2019ve talked a lot about both client and product segmentation. And I think, in every instance what we\u2019re trying to do is to effectively evaluate the value proposition to an individual client from buying the product. In the core, we clearly have seen a group of clients who are significantly more focused on price than they\u2019re necessarily aftermarket liquidity, bid-ask spread or tracking error. And so for that segment of the world, we are obviously focusing a product significantly more focused on price.","There\u2019s another segment of the marketplace that frankly is not necessarily long-term buy and hold, they\u2019re much more interested in tracking error. They\u2019re much more interested in making sure there\u2019s enough liquidity if they decide to get out in significant volume. And for that segment of the population, they\u2019re less focused on price and more on the other elements of the value proposition that the ETF brings to the table.","And so that segmentation, we talk about core, we talk about precision instruments, we talk about financial instruments. We\u2019re trying to make sure that in every instance, we\u2019re understanding the value proposition that the clients are looking for and making sure that we price the product accordingly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Laurence Fink","Hello, Mike.","Michael Cyprys","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to circle back on some of the comments you\u2019re making around investing in the business. I think, you mentioned that today\u2019s organic growth as a result, assuming investments that you\u2019ve made over the past couple of years. I guess, the question is, how much are you investing in the business today? And how does that compare with what you\u2019ve invested over the past couple of years? And just given the changes that are occurring within the industry, do you feel a need to accelerate or pick up the pace of investments versus what you\u2019ve done historically?","Laurence Fink","Well, I think the pace of the amount of investing that we\u2019re doing is clearly accelerating as the business is getting bigger, and our financial resources are becoming more significant and the complexity of the business is changing.","So I think, every year we go through a process of identifying a number of strategic initiatives, which we talk to you about all the time whether it\u2019s ETFs more broadly; smart beta and factors; infrastructure; illiquid alternatives, including infrastructure; as Larry mentioned, retail; technology; institutional technology more broadly and regional expansion. I mean, these are just a number of things that we\u2019re doing not the least of which is planning for a new headquarters six years out and other things that are just kind of more business as usual.","So I think, there\u2019s no question that we are continuing to invest. Obviously, to the extent, you have markets that cooperate with you, it makes some of those decisions a little bit easier. But I think as we\u2019ve shown in prior years, we\u2019re trying to be very consistent with our investment spend notwithstanding what markets are doing in any point in time, because we do stay focused on the long-term. And to the extent that basically, we find ourselves trying to balance the tradeoff between growth and margin. We aggressively look to reallocate our resources in a way that allows us to do both at any point in time.","Laurence Fink","I would just add, because I think this is a really important component of who we are and where we\u2019re going. I think, we have a unique competitive advantage, because of those investments it\u2019s clear to me that we got \u2013 we need to continue to invest to be competitively in front of our \u2013 the needs of our clients and our competitors. And I do believe as we position our technology, especially the investment technology to reach more clients, Aladdin for Wealth Management to be on more desktops for \u2013 with more of the financial advisors, investing in alpha signals in our scientific businesses, I believe it\u2019s critical for us to stay in front of these big giant trends.","And I \u2013 as I said in my prepared remarks, if we have not \u2013 if we did not make those investments a few years back, we would not be in a position of really working with our clients and picking up considerable market share with our clients institutionally and in retail, and we look at this in a very competitive way. We believe our scale is a real advantage.","And as Gary said, as our scale has increased, it gives us even a greater competitive advantage. And we do believe data, technology, risk management is going to continue to drive hopefully better financial literacy that gets back to my, once again, my whole concept of financial literacy for better outcome investing.","The organization that can provide that seamless information to get some of that money that\u2019s essentially been trapped in short-term strategies into proper long-term investing, it would have a remarkable impact on the results for our clients and remarkable impact to the society and a remarkable impact on the companies that provide that. So I look at this is essential. And so we will continue to be investing to be that one key leader for those events and those opportunities.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Rob.","Robert Lee","Good morning. Hey, good morning, guys. Sometimes, it seems that there are so many opportunities ahead of you that maybe the \u2013 your \u2013 one of your biggest challenges is maximizing them. And how do you organize yourself to maximize them just given there are so many things going on? And I know in the past, you\u2019ve done things like combined solutions with the institutional sales force or things of that nature. So can you maybe just update us if there\u2019s any \u2013 do you feel like you have the kind of for the moment at least the right structure with any kind of organizational changes you think you\u2019re thinking about, or could be necessary to kind of really maximize the opportunities you see?","Laurence Fink","Well, as you know, it\u2019s been \u2013 it\u2019s not planned, but it appears almost every year, we are making some leadership changes. We did that already earlier this year in terms of really enhancing some of our regional coverage, enhancing our alpha business and enhancing and really enhancing our global equity platforms. The demands on opportunities that we see are greater than our ability to achieve them.","So you\u2019re correct in asserting that we see more opportunities or let me restate potential opportunities. The key is for us is to focus on the opportunities that we think we can maximize with our platform, with our clients. I would say clearly over the last number of years, I would say clearly for more than 10 years, we\u2019ve been more right on those strategies and not. This is why I personally spend so much time on strategy and positioning our firm. This is another reason why I spend so much time visiting clients.","I would clearly say loud and clear 80% of our strategies have been led by what we\u2019re hearing from our clients, which is that they can have some type of technology solution. They want to have a better understanding of ESG, they want to have better understanding of how they could integrate more infrastructure as a platform. How they can navigate the defined contribution plan in some form of bypass.","So it is a big task in trying to making sure that we\u2019re focused on the right strategy. And what I would say, what Gary Shedlin and Rob Goldstein and really navigating the moment by moment types of issues around there, we\u2019re \u2013 they\u2019re constantly focused on eliminating some organizational inefficiencies. So I don\u2019t want to say, we\u2019re perfect. And I don\u2019t want to say, we don\u2019t constantly have to refresh ourselves, because we do. We have to refresh ourselves to stay in front of the environment that we\u2019re operating, stay in front of our clients, and there are always inefficiencies.","So I\u2019m not trying to suggest we are solving all the problems. But if have \u2013 we have teams that are focusing on eliminating organizational inefficiencies. We\u2019re making decisions by listening to the end clients. And we also believe what is necessary Rob Kapito mentioned this early, we have to be closer to our clients and this is why are \u2013 the regionalization effort is so very important. So we can listen to our clients better.","And then I would say, one of the great successes in picking our strategies has been the advent of the BlackRock Investor Institute. By bringing all the thoughts together hopefully to have better alpha outcomes, but also bringing all that information flow into a \u2013 into one platform to redistribute, it really gives us great insight. And it\u2019s that insight that helps us navigate the strategies that we are going to concentrate in. And I believe it\u2019s through that insight that has allowed us to have a better batting average in picking the right strategies to invest in the future.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Mike.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Maybe just a two-part question on the technology side. So you guys are spending a lot of time on the retail or the wealth management front. And your relative size there versus institutional seems like there\u2019s a great opportunity. I just wanted to see if you could either size that or where you are and maybe the penetration of that opportunity? And then as that kind of relates to efficiencies in the business like how you see that playing out as that continues to scale up. Are you kind of make progress on that opportunity, how that will play through efficiencies and through the operating leverage given the model?","Laurence Fink","Well, let me just say very clearly, as I said in my prepared remarks and Gary did too. MiFID II and some fiduciary standard rule really changes the whole ballgame, not just for where assets are going to move, but risk supervision is critical under our fiduciary standard rule. As I said the CIO office is going to have a lot more responsibility in the various platforms. And so that drives a lot of interest in Aladdin for Wealth Management.","So we continue to believe that will continue to drive more opportunities. The \u2013 in terms of efficiencies, obviously, we\u2019ve learned a lot from the beginnings of our institutional Aladdin business. So that unquestionably as we gain more clients, we are a more efficient platform. As \u2013 but Aladdin for Wealth Management is a considerably different platform.","I mean Aladdin for Wealth Management, we could have 10,000 users. And it\u2019s a very different platform and this is why I don\u2019t want to say Aladdin \u2013 the Institutional Aladdin business is going to create so many efficiencies for us and margin expansion as we use Aladdin for Wealth Management. We believe if we could penetrate more and we see great opportunities for penetration, unquestionably over time there\u2019s more efficiencies.","But let me \u2013 let\u2019s also be clearly, much of the success around Aladdin for Wealth Management will drive more close to BlackRock. Both going to \u2013 it\u2019s going to evolve. Let\u2019s be clear, because I get tired of that question, Mike with a question that I was asked before related to technology.","Our ecosystem is evolving. I think, it\u2019s evolving very rapidly now. I think, this low return environment is forcing clients more than ever before to focus on fees, to focus on relationships, to focus on how they want solutions to be provided. So you have it incredibly evolving ecosystem worldwide. At the same time, we\u2019re seeing a huge expansion of the global capital markets. And less so we are seeing the utilization of more technology and how technology is disrupting traditional things and changing the system even more rapidly.","So the most important thing for us is to stay in front of it, to be helpful to all our clients and obviously, we\u2019re helpful for all our clients. We\u2019re going to win more share with more share. We\u2019re going to drive better efficiencies. So efficiencies are important, so I\u2019m not trying to dispute anything about, and we focus on efficiencies. And I can tell you, Rob Goldstein and Gary Shedlin focus on that relentlessly, but it\u2019s more important that we stay in front of change as an organization.","If we\u2019re a firm that stays in front of change on behalf of our clients, our clients will award us more share of wallet.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","I think, I said almost everything, but I have \u2013 first of all, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest at BlackRock. I think, our third quarter directly is linked to the comments that we\u2019ve had related to the investments made over time and how those investments have translated that into improved margins, improved revenues, improved AUM, improved operating income, and most importantly, better and more improved relationships with our clients.","Hopefully, this is well recognized by all of our investors, and we will continue to leverage our differentiating scale. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in investments in technology. As I said, to deliver that value to our clients, to stay in front of our clients and that\u2019s my commitment to all of you as our shareholders that we will \u2013 our objective is to stay in front of our client needs, so we could be more valuable to our clients.","With that, everyone have a good quarter.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher J. Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.","As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption of FASB's revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1.","During our second quarter earnings call, we noted that clients were deferring investment decisions in the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape. While we saw a modest pickup in industry flows during the third quarter, primarily attributable to ETFs, we also saw accelerated de-risking by many clients in an environment marked by continued trade tensions, a further slowdown in emerging markets, and a steepening yield curve.","Against this backdrop, more clients are looking to BlackRock for investment guidance and technology solutions than ever before. Despite current headwinds impacting the asset management industry, our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our highest growth businesses such as iShares, multi-asset solutions, illiquid alternatives, and Aladdin. These investments will enable us to deliver differentiated organic growth for the future.","BlackRock generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite over $30 billion of institutional index equity outflows. Quarterly net inflows were positive across our iShares and active fixed income, multi-asset and alternatives platforms.","Third quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose by 1%. Earnings per share of $7.52 were up 27% compared to a year-ago, driven primarily by higher nonoperating income and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $63 million of net investment income driven in large part by gains related to the sale of our minority interest in DSP Group, and the revaluation of a strategic minority investment.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 16% and included $90 million of discrete benefits primarily related to changes in our organizational tax structure. We continue to estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.","Third quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and organic base fee growth, offset by previously announced pricing investments in iShares. Sequentially, base fees were down 2% compared to the second quarter reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue, the negative impact of foreign exchange movement and our recent iShares pricing investments, partially offset by a higher day count in the third quarter.","Our overall fee rate declined by about 0.6 basis point sequentially as base fee growth lagged overall growth in average AUM, primarily reflecting seasonally lower securities lending revenue and the impact of divergent beta as emerging markets and commodities continue to underperform developed markets. While the S&P 500, which generally tracks products with lower fee rates was up approximately 10% over the 6 months ended September 30, higher fee emerging markets exposures were down 10% on a dollar basis over that same time period.","As a consequence of beta divergence intensifying toward the end of the quarter, our fourth quarter base fee entry rate will be lower than overall third quarter base fees. Performance fees of $151 million decreased $40 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from liquid alternative and long-only funds in a challenging environment for the hedge fund industry. Sequentially, performance fees increased as a result of a single European hedge fund that once again delivered exceptional full-year performance and locks annually in the third quarter.","Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 18% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue. While overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, 2018 has thus far been a particularly strong year for Aladdin, reflecting an outsized number of new clients sourced during the prior year and successfully implemented during the last 9 months. We continue to target low to mid teens growth for our technology business over the long term.","Total expense increased 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher G&A and volume related expense. Quarterly G&A expense of $413 million reflected higher technology spend and included $13 million of deal-related expense related to strategic transactions completed during the quarter and $29 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions. At present, we would anticipate fourth quarter G&A to include normal, seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend.","Direct fund expense was up $18 million or 8% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise. Our third quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 44.2% was down 90 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower performance fees and the $42 million of transaction-related expenses in the current quarter.","We remain margin aware especially in the current environment, but will continue to thoughtfully invest in our higher growth businesses to ensure we meet the needs of clients in this rapidly changing ecosystem. In line with that commitment, we closed several strategic transactions during the quarter that added a net $28 billion to our AUM and will accelerate our growth.","We closed the acquisitions of Citibanamex Asset Management, furthering our goal to be a full solutions provider in Mexico and Tennenbaum Capital Partners, enhancing our private credit capabilities. In addition, we completed the transfer of our UK Defined Contribution Administration business to Aegon and the sale of our minority interest in DSP.","We also repurchased $500 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, $200 million greater than our planned quarterly run rate as we saw attractive relative valuation opportunities in our stock during this time. Quarterly long-term net inflows of $11 billion were led by flows into strategic focus areas, including iShares, multi-asset strategies, and illiquid alternatives offset by outflows from lower fee, institutional index equity products.","Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $34 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. iShares flows beyond the quarter rebounded after a challenging second quarter, delivering net inflows of $13 billion driven by fixed income. Flows were well diversified across long duration treasuries, corporate bond, high yield and emerging market debt ETFs.","Fidelity's decision to reduce overall barriers to investing and triple the number of commission free iShares available on their direct and adviser platforms resulted in the strongest August iShares inflows in the 5-year history of our strategic relationship. We believe that actions by direct platforms to reduce transaction costs will accelerate ETF industry growth, especially as more iShares are now available commission free than ever before.","Retail net inflows of $2 billion reflected strength in active fixed income led by municipals, unconstrained and high yield strategies, and event driven liquid alternative funds, partially offset by outflows from non-U.S equities. In the United States, our active strategies continue to see positive organic growth and gain market share even as the domestic retail industry continues to see outflows.","Institutional net outflows of $25 billion resulted primarily from over $30 billion of index equity outflows as clients continued to de-risk, rebalance or seek liquidity in the current environment. Despite overall institutional net outflows, we saw continued demand for multi-asset solutions OCIO, LDI, fixed income and illiquid alternatives. Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continues.","The third quarter represented our most successful fundraising quarter ever as BlackRock generated approximately $2 billion in net client flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments across the platform highlighted by the $1.5 billion first close of global energy and power infrastructure fund 3.","BlackRock's illiquid alternatives franchise now has approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing almost $160 million in incremental base fees and the opportunity for significant performance fees over time.","Finally, BlackRock's cash management business experienced net outflows of $15 billion, driven by the planned redemption of a single escrow mandate. Excluding this redemption, our cash platforms saw a $9 billion of net inflows and continues to leverage scale and cash matrix technology to better serve clients. We are now the second largest money market managers globally and have steadily increased market share by more than 250 basis points over the last 3 years.","BlackRock scaled global investment and technology platform was purposely built to weather the cyclical and secular headwinds impacting today's asset management business. We've shown an ability to grow and maintain margin in difficult markets before. Our diverse platform is as well-positioned as it's ever been to meet the evolving needs of client and we remain focused on playing offense by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management.","With that, I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's third quarter results demonstrates to resilience of our differentiated platform as we once again delivered organic growth even in the face of industry headwinds. And we\u2019ve been through these tough markets -- tough market environments before and BlackRock has consistently delivered growth, though asset management -- flow through asset management flows and technology revenues, while exercising expense discipline and investing for our future.","We built our platform around a holistic client centric approach and today we are delivering a broader spectrum of investment strategies in technology capabilities to more clients than at any time in our history. However, as Gary mentioned, many of the challenges facing our clients continued in the third quarter have accelerated with recent marketing volatility.","Divergence monetary policy and macro and geopolitical uncertainty continues to impact investor sentiment and our financial markets, leading many clients to reduce risk in their portfolios. After a decade-long rise of multilateralism, protectionist agendas are pushing forward around the world. Concerns over trade tensions and particularly are weighing on investor sentiments. Meanwhile a strong U.S economy is adding to investor concerns about overheating and the potential for greater than previously anticipated fed -- Federal Reserve rate hikes.","Political instability in certain markets is increasing. In Italy, for example, the government significantly widened its budget deficit for 2019 driving Italian bond yields to their highest levels since 2014. And in Brazil the Presidential election is intensifying political polarization. These developments are all heightening worldwide investors concerns. As a result, financial markets performance continues to diverge in 2018. While our U.S equities reached record highs in the third quarter driven by strong corporate earnings growth, European markets are trading below where they were a year-ago and emerging markets and commodities remain under pressure.","Investors worldwide are taking a defensive posture highlighted by the market volatility we saw last week. Short-term government bond funds are seeing their highest inflows since 2010. Cash balances have grown to $80 trillion globally even as companies execute record amount of share repurchases and M&A accelerates globally. Asset management industry flows overall has slowed considerably. At the same time in this environment even more clients are turning to BlackRock for investment and technology solutions to navigate their portfolios.","Throughout the quarter and in recent weeks, we announced a number of significant partnerships with a large -- with large long-term clients, all of which highlights BlackRock's differentiating value proposition. We generated $11 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, despite more than $30 billion of non-ETF index equity outflows, much of which are connected with clients who are de-risking. And as Gary said, our technology services grew by 18% year-over-year.","BlackRock's platform is strategically positioned to capture long-term growth in key areas of our business. We remain focused on further strengthening investment performance, enhancing our presence in local markets around the world, expanding our digital capabilities and using scale and technology to better serve clients and deliver shareholder value.","One of our most differentiating areas of growth is our iShares ETF platform. We expect the ETF platform could double to more than $12 trillion in the next 5 years, driven by long-term secular trends. In the third quarter, iShares generated $34 billion in net inflows and BlackRock once again captured the number one share of global ETF flows for the quarter and year-to-date.","iShares core products generated $20 billion in net inflows in the quarter. Long-term investors who are less reactive to the current market environment continue to invest in core broad market exposures often through model portfolios. In addition, we saw flows of $11 billion in the fixed-income as wealth managers and institutional investors are adopting fixed-income ETS.","Fixed-income is one of the areas within iShares where broad ecosystem innovation is driving strong growth. This category have seen in excess of 20% annual organic growth in each of the last four years and we expect strong secular growth to continue. Fixed-income ETF provide investors with liquid vehicles for core and tactical bond allocations and reduce complexities in management of these bond portfolios.","Demand has risen as investors gain more confidence in their benefits and simplicity, and as clients search for liquidity in global bond markets in an environment where increased bank capital requirements have diminished supply.","This quarter BlackRock in partnership with the CBOE launched the first iShares high-yield corporate bond index future. We also partnered with the Intercontinental Exchange to establish an industry-wide open architecture primary market platform for ETFs that will -- will improve the trading ecosystem to help support continued growth.","In addition to ETFs, clients are choosing BlackRock's other active index fixed-income strategies as they look for solutions across the risk spectrum. We continue to see strong performance across our active fixed-income platform were 84% of our fundamental fixed-income assets are above benchmarks or peer medians for the 5-year period.","We generated $2 billion of inflows in active fixed-income mutual funds in the quarter led by our municipal bonds and our flagship unconstrained SIO product. We also generated $7 billion of institutional fixed-income inflows led by liability driven investment strategies in the U.S. With rising interest rates, U.S equity markets hitting all-time high and U.S pension funding ratios improving, client demand to de-risk and immunize portfolios is increasing.","The long-term opportunity for our LDI platform is strong and we have more closely integrated LDI with our global fixed-income platform, so we could provide clients with a broader fixed-income and cash flow solution. Our active equity platform has made progress as we bring our fundamental and systematic teams closer together to better leverage the power of increased connectivity and data science. 80% of our Fundamental Active Equity's, up 11% from last year and 92% of our Systematic Active Equity assets were above benchmark for peer median for the 5-year period.","In alternatives, the investments we\u2019ve made to position BlackRock as an industry leading manager for our clients are showing up in our results. Through a combination of organic and inorganic growth, our group alternative platform is now $109 billion including $57 billion in illiquid alternatives. BlackRock generated $2 billion in core alternative flows and raised an additional $4 billion in commitments in the third quarter.","We are well-positioned to grow this business through strong investment performance and scaled asset raising and sourcing. Across our illiquid platform, we\u2019ve raised $16 billion in gross commitments over the last 12 months and our market share of illiquid alternative industry fund raising has more than doubled in the last two years. We expect continual growth in investments in illiquid alternatives and expect this to be an ever-growing contributor to our financial results over time.","BlackRock continues to be both positioning ourselves as a leader and to drive change in anticipation of industry transformation and client future needs. Our strategy is focused first and foremost on our clients and their evolving needs from iShares to factors to illiquid alternatives and our long-term aspirations include being a first mover and a leader in technology, a leader in retirement and ultimately a leader in the Chinese asset management business. As the asset and wealth management landscape evolve, clients are increasingly looking for strategic partners for a broad range of solutions.","In U.S wealth, BlackRock has recently been designated a strategic partner by Edward Jones, reflecting the expansion of our long-term relationship. 17,000 Edward Jones advisors now have access to BlackRock's platform of investment strategies, our educational content and how we practice our management.","Additionally, as Gary mentioned, we expanded our strategic partnership with Fidelity in August. They added a 170 commission free iShares ETFs to their platform for a total of 240 ETFs in an effort to increase accessibility to investing for more and more clients. BlackRock has also been recently selected as a strategic partner to Scottish Widows and Lloyd Banks for a $40 billion dollar index mandate and to collaborate on solutions across alternatives, our risk management platform and technology. More than ever before, our clients are looking for asset management partners who can understand and provide investment solutions on their entire portfolio. This concept is becoming the new definition of active management.","Earlier this year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions group, which brings together BlackRock's full platform including our most comprehensive range of market cap weighted, factor based, alpha seeking and illiquid alternative strategies with research, technology and portfolio construction expertise to deliver a holistic solution to our clients.","Sustainable investing for ESG is another area where an increase in demand from clients globally coupled with BlackRock's investment and technology expertise is driving large-scale momentum.","Earlier this month, along with the governments of France and Germany and several nongovernmental organizations, we announced the formation of the client -- the climate finance partnership. The group will explore the development of investment strategies that would be managed by BlackRock and invest in climate infrastructure in the emerging market world.","Last week we also announced our partnership with Wespath on an investment strategy designed for the transition to a low carbon economy. BlackRock will manage the strategy for Wespath and offer to other BlackRock clients who seek to achieve both sustainable investing in financial objectives.","Potentially the greatest client need of our time, however, is the global retirement challenge. It is likely to dramatically reshape our industry and our firm. BlackRock has committed to helping drive the solution in this crisis and has made this challenge a strategic priority. Last month we announced the establishment of the new retirement solutions group, which will explore lack of access to retirement plans, the need for guaranteed income and innovation, innovative solutions to improve retirement investing.","BlackRock's Aladdin technology enables us to solve clients most complex needs and also to address industry transformation. Today insurers and banks are facing consolidation in evolving regulatory requirements, creating the need for more holistic flexible technology driven solutions.","Asset and wealth managers are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently and rigorously managing risk in more volatile market environments at times with this type of volatilities where we see more interest in our Aladdin business. These trends are driving increased demand for BlackRock's broad-based technology services and digital tools, like institutional Aladdin or Aladdin for Wealth and Cachematrix technology services grew by 18% year-over-year and we expect these trends to continue to drive low to mid teens growth on an annual basis going forward.","The impact of technology is extending beyond our direct technology business. For example, we're transformating [ph] our cash management business, one of BlackRock's oldest businesses, by integrating technology into our business model. We're delivering training technology powered by Cachematrix to onboard cash clients who are looking for more than a simple cash product. Cash management in BlackRock is now a technology business. Whether it would be index or active or ESG strategies or factors or alternatives and with technology, BlackRock is positioned to deliver solutions for clients.","We're leading the evolution of the industry and are better prepared today to meet our clients' needs than ever before. This is reflected in the depth and the quality of the dialogue we are having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that especially in markets like these while clients maybe slow in putting money to work, they\u2019re putting an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer.","With that, let's open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Dan.","Dan Fannon","I guess, Larry, could you elaborate on your broader comments about de-risking? It seems based on your commentary that we -- it should likely continue here in the short-term and we're seeing it through your index products. So I guess are there other kind of asset classes we -- that you're seeing that in? And then also, is there a capture rate where you're seeing flows going into other categories that are obviously less risky?","Laurence D. Fink","I will let Rob talk about it and then I will add to it after him.","Robert S. Kapito","So I think, Larry, mentioned increased trade tensions, emerging markets volatility, and certainly the fear of continued interest rate rises across the globe. So what happens, especially during that type of volatility period is clients de-risk. So depending upon the next couple weeks and some of the political issues as well and the volatility that's out there, clients may continue to de-risk. Certainly, we've seen the hedge funds de-risk from a period of time where I think across the board most of them are already down 2% 4%, so getting below that is difficult for many hedge funds, so they\u2019ve just risked -- de-risked. And we also, depending upon the guidelines of the clients and what we think about the markets, we encourage either de-risking or risking depending upon what their objectives are. The goal for us is even in that de-risking, to capture those assets because whatever they're selling and going into, we have that product. So whether clients move from equity to fixed, we can accomplish that. Whether they\u2019re going from value to growth, long duration to short duration, out of emerging markets into emerged markets, our goal is to offer a holistic solution so that they can de-risk and then be ready to put the risk on with us as well. And that also moves from product to product, whether they do it in iShares, and typically they'll do that in the non-core iShares that have the most liquidity. Clients in the core iShares do that less because they\u2019re more buy-and-hold. So, we see that more in the active products, and I think that really describes a lot of the flows this quarter.","Laurence D. Fink","Let me just add a little more. I think the market movements post third quarter was, as Rob said, more hedge funds de-risking. We did not see any accelerated outflows in the first few weeks. I think, Dan, when you think about some of these big large strategic partnerships we announced, none of that was asset flows this quarter. All of this is going to be huge asset flows probably in 2019. And this is why we are spending so much time trying to develop these deeper relationships. We are not going to be able to predict or strive for any one quarter, but I do -- we're very excited about the opportunities of building these deeper relationships that over time are going to really push us towards a much higher growth rate. That being said, if the markets remain to be uncertain, if political risk remains large, you will continue to see clients pause. We\u2019ve seen this in the past. Generally, in the fourth quarter, we see clients adding risk that is typically what happens especially November, December. We -- and so, I\u2019m not here to tell you, I know how this will all play out, but we are continuing to see large interest from our clients in our technology businesses, we're continuing to see large interest from our clients in our alternative space and let me also talk about the breadth of our active business for a second. We had positive active flows in fixed, in multi-asset, and in alts. The only area where we had outflows that were significant was in the low-fee index products, and that I think, Rob Kapito has talked about this for years, that's where we see how people navigate money. They go in and out of index funds in large-scale as an indicator of their market beliefs. So -- and I would also say unlike most organizations in the industry we had positive flows in U.S wealth in our retail side. So I don't know the outcome of this quarter or political uncertainty, but all I could say is we're -- we have very strong conversations going on right now with really important clients and we will see how that plays out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning, Larry. So it was nice to see another quarter here of larger buybacks. Can you remind us how much capacity via excess capital and debt capacity BlackRock has now? And how we should forecast capital management over the next few quarters just given your very systematic approach over the last few years?","Laurence D. Fink","Gary?","Gary S. Shedlin","Good morning, Craig. So our capital management policies have not changed. I think it's -- we remain committed to obviously first investing in our business, and then returning excess cash flow to shareholders, that that will continue. Obviously, it's not necessarily tied to any 12-month period of time. We look at cash over a broader period of time than that, because we try not to be that specific. But we are committed to a 40% to 50% dividend payout ratio, and then paying the incremental back. As we\u2019ve said many times, our total payout ratio is really an output as opposed to an input of our planning, and we will take into account all the various opportunities for investment in the business whether through our P&L, through our seed capital, through taxable inorganic opportunities. We\u2019ve been pretty clear that our run rate going into the year was about $1.2 billion, [ph] or $300 million a quarter. We did slightly more than that earlier in the year. We saw opportunities to accelerate that this past quarter where we did $500 million, and we will continue to plan assuming our run rate is current and then looking at opportunities to more aggressively allocate liquidity to the stock price where we think it's a good investment for our shareholders.","As it relates to how much liquidity we have, obviously as you know, we\u2019ve never been capital constrained either from a cash flow or P&L investment point of view. We have about $5 billion of long-term debt on our balance sheet. We are levered at less than 1x, so we obviously have significant liquidity capacity if we so choose to use it for a variety of strategic opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just on the commission free ETFs, which you defined as an opportunity to lead to growth in ETFs. Just curious if there's any color you could share in terms of the number of platforms that you\u2019re on today with commission free ETFs and how much more penetration we could see? And how you see the duration profile of the iShares changing, if at all, with more commission free ETFs? In other words, do we see more flows, but maybe more volatility within the flows as it becomes more commission free? Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Laurence D. Fink","So the whole commission free situation was actually a very large benefit to BlackRock. And I don't know if that story really got out that well. Because especially at Fidelity, what was not -- what was hidden I think in the communication was they actually added over 170 new ETFs to their platform commission free. So if that's the case, we obviously have many more on a very strong platform and it attracts many more investors because there's no trading costs. So I don't know if it's going to really change the profile. I would imagine since most of the people on those platforms are more equity than fixed income long-term investors, it may push them towards more equities. We haven't really been able to see a true trend yet, except that there are more buyers and that\u2019s been positive to us. So our growth on that platform continues. Obviously, that will be the same on other platforms that begin to offer commission free ETFs. So this was a very big positive to us to continue. As you know, we have the number one market share globally of ETS. So we really have more people on it. It will give us more opportunity to distribute. But I haven't seen a trend yet, Michael, to tell you that there will be more of any one particular one. What I'm hoping for is that we get to see some of the smart beta, which we have over 100 different smart betas. We have a lot of the ESG ETFs coming onto the platform. So I think there's a big opportunity there and I hope that we're finding out that a lot of investors are interested in ESG. So hopefully they will express that through our iShares. But on the particular Fidelity platform, they\u2019ve been great partners who had the best August we ever had since the pricing moved, even in what was considered a very tough market. So very optimistic as new buyers can enter the market commission free.","Robert S. Kapito","Let me add one more -- two more things. I believe more and more the market for ETFs will be commission free. I think it's incredibly important. So for the retail investor commissions, the trading commissions can be larger than the commissions or the fees of the asset manager. So when you\u2019re trying to save for retirement and you're only investing, let's say, a $1000 at a time, the commissions were eating up quite a better of return. And so we actually believe commission free ETFs is going to lead to better outcomes for retirement. It's going to lead more investors to invest in ETFs for retirement and I believe this is a really important trend for all the ETF industry, but I also believe it's a very important trend for the advancement of pools of money for retirement. So we look at this as it's not just important for the ETF industry, we believe it's important contributor to the strategies of the wealth management platforms as they try to help clients navigate the whole cumbersome component of retirement. And we believe a commission free environment for ETFs is going to lead to far better outcomes of investing for retirement.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Ken.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. This sort of follows up on Michael's question. So price has been a key differentiator in core ETFs, the majority of your ETFs are non-core. What are the longer-term success factors in non-core? So, you\u2019ve mentioned liquidity as a factor, maybe a key factor in the past, does liquidity remain a key driver for the non-core ETF sales, or does that become less differentiated as the ETF market grows? To Michael's question, you mentioned commission free trading and distribution relationships are important. You alluded to product development in ESG, but what is most important for non-core ETF growth over time? And what is that say about the pricing that you think you could get for non-core? Will it hold up or does it sort of eventually mirror the core side? Thank you.","Robert S. Kapito","So I think the two most important things are brand and liquidity. So this is what those people that are more active and they participate under non-core want in purchasing their ETFs. And I think that what hasn't been talked about is this last move in volatility. We haven't seen any stories of any issues in the liquidity of ETFs. All of a sudden that is off the front page. They actually work. So the large and liquid with brand has actually provided more liquidity in the marketplace. The more situations we have like that, the more large investors will come in and have confidence in the market. So I think we saw that. So in essence, I would say brand is still very important. Liquidity and that\u2019s due to the scale and size of the products that we actually have are the most important going forward. And I do think that's going to translate as more and more people get focused on either the smart beta in which they are using this to really focus on one of the factors in the market that they think will drive it going forward. And the second thing will be the ESG, where as large plans have the responsibility now to be asked by their boards to express that in their portfolios, I think they\u2019re going to want to express it in ETFs that have that brand that also have the liquidity in it.","Laurence D. Fink","Let me add a little more to that, Ken. I think retail has always been more a buy-and-hold strategy. I think retail continues to be focused on more core oriented strategies for their, I would say, their large component of their investment strategies. But as ETFs expand whether it is ESG that Rob was talking about or factor based or emerging markets in other areas, we still believe that as Rob said, brand liquidity are major component. And I don't believe those two components lead to each other. So we are not seeing any indication, any issues related to a worsening of prices related to the non-core. But core is being -- growth is being driven by essentially by retail individuals that continues to be a major component of it. And those core products just don't have liquidity, that\u2019s some of the non-core strategies have. They don\u2019t have -- and some of the non-core strategies now have options against it and they have a much more derivative-based market around that too. And so they\u2019re almost two different ecosystems both serving their clients and this is what's great about it, in their specific needs. Some clients have it a long-term need to invest for retirement and that\u2019s a buy-and-hold. And that\u2019s why we so much -- why we adopted that core strategy and we have a large component of our institutional clients worldwide are using it for asset allocation. They\u2019re using it for exposures and brand and liquidity is very important and remain to be important.","Robert S. Kapito","I don\u2019t think you will see pricing pressure as much because of the demand and it's only the large illiquid and ones with the brand that can offer the futures, the options, and the derivative. So I think this is as Larry said, a separate market. And I think because of that we can command a higher price.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence D. Fink","Hello.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everybody. So wanted to build the discussion on Larry's points around the strategic partnership with wealth managers. You hit on the Fidelity and the kind of the commission free model, but looking at the wirehouses and other brokerage firm networks, can you spend a little bit on how these partnerships are structured? What\u2019s sort of the spectrum of products this creates for you guys both in a technology and the asset management side of things? And I guess, looking out into 2018 maybe a little more color, Larry, from you why you think these will yield stronger flows for you?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, I mean, our first indication from Fidelity, we\u2019re seeing stronger flows immediately after one month. So we did begin to see that and we continue to believe that will continue to yield more flows. In terms of the wires, I mean, one of the great success story so far that\u2019s just been implemented and one just was launched in its existence is Aladdin for wealth. So UBS and Morgan Stanley both use Aladdin for wealth. We have other organizations that we are working on. We have -- actually other organizations worldwide are adapting Aladdin for wealth. And so, it is through technology that is advancing our positioning with our wires. It is trying to work with them on ETF strategies, but I actually believe the relationships that we have with the wires now are more comprehensive, more holistic than anytime ever and we believe like we just said -- as I said, this last week was when we went live with Morgan Stanley. We believe through those processes we're going to start seeing maybe in the fourth quarter in 2019, increased flows through our holistic relationships with our wires of all our strategic partners. The other area where you're seeing especially from the wires, which is starting to become a bigger driver of their business, and one of the reasons while we believe over the next 5 years ETFs will double in size is how more and more wires as they move more towards away from brokerage and more to a consultive relationship or advice, they're using more models. And in the models are heavily populated by different BlackRock and iShares products. And so we believe over time we're getting ourselves better positioned that have deeper more holistic relationships. And we continue to believe that is what's going to be driving our future growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Brian.","Brian Bedell","Hey, good morning. Maybe switching gears little bit on pension plan rebalancing. Larry, maybe just your view of how that might increase to the rebalancing from equities to fixed income might increase. What kind of maybe yield thresholds do you think that will be a catalyst for that? And obviously you guys are positioned to capture that on the fixed income side. Do you see that from your perspective coming mostly in LDI, or do you think your active fixed income products can take the large share of that? And then, maybe just a little bit more color on the Lloyds arrangement with the $40 billion. Is that just a part that\u2019s coming more quickly? And I think you are in a strategic partnership with them for a potential of up to \u20a4100 million.","Laurence D. Fink","So on year-end rebalancing, but before the market setback, I would have said there would be a lot of rebalancing out of equities into more fixed income. Now with the markets resetting itself, I think that rebalancing out of equities is going to be diminished quite a bit. Obviously, we still have a full quarter to see. Higher rates is good for more and more pension funds. They reset their liabilities, and higher interest rates is a reset. Keep in mind, it's based off the tenure, not the short end. So the tenure has only moved, I don't know, on the year, 30 basis points. So it's not a significant move. But net, net, net, you are going to see more and more pension funds using as you raise LDI. We are seeing more and more clients looking to use BlackRock services on LDI. It's one of our growth areas in the last quarter and continues to be an opportunity for us. I don't know how significant that will be. We will see where markets are and rates are over the course of the balance of this year, but we do believe the trend will be over the long-term for pension funds to reduce their exposures in their defined benefit plans. As you know, more and more money is now moving in the defined contribution. So it is -- we do have that dynamics. Just real quickly on Lloyds, we don\u2019t describe what the client is doing. The client came out with a press release. I don't believe I could talk about more than what the client released in their press release. We have a strong, deep relationship with them. At the moment, we won a \u20a430 billion mandate for index products. We also agreed on a partnership in terms of alternatives, where we believe we are going to see systematic quarter-by-quarter flows in our alternative platform. We are looking at -- they are looking at utilization of our Aladdin platform and other forms of technology. So it's a comprehensive relationship. It is deep and related to the other pool of assets, we will see. I mean, it -- we will see about that outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Good morning. Hey, Gary, just one for you on the expenses. You mentioned the $42 million in the transaction cost in the quarter, and then that the typical seasonality that we see in G&A. I guess just want to level set that, should we be expecting the $42 million to come out and then build off of that in terms of the seasonality? And then, just given the seasonality, how does the -- maybe the diverging beta or the headwinds that you guys are seeing on the revenue side kind of factor into that?","Gary S. Shedlin","So the $42 million, there is a component of that. And again, we\u2019ve tried to give you a little bit more visibility through some better disclosure, both in the press release and the Q. But there's a portion of that, that is more professional fee-related, as I mentioned, about $13 million tied to closing a number of transactions that clearly will come out. The contingent purchase price adjustments is going to be a part of our P&L for some period of time. We have about 250 plus million dollars of contingent purchase price liability on our balance sheet. We will have to fair value that every quarter. The bad news is when it goes up, it creates some noise in our G&A line. The good news is when it goes up, it means the deals we\u2019ve done are doing better. The most significant component this quarter was tied to the first reserve transaction where the expectations for our ability to raise assets in the coming quarters has gone up, which is why we\u2019re providing that. So we will do as best we can to call that out for you, so that you can see some of that volatility in what we would consider kind of more non-recurring quarter G&A expense. In terms of expectations for the fourth quarter, I think you\u2019ve got it right on. I think the intent was to try and call out for you that component that kind of is a little less recurring and to just highlight what has been the case for the last couple of years is that our marketing spend tends to go up in the fourth quarter, and you obviously know what that was during the third quarter. I think your broader question as it relates to the business model today in light of a more challenged revenue environment. Look, I think, for us, we\u2019ve purposely built a very diverse business with both index, active, alternatives and cash to move away from any specific product, but really to focus on delivering, as Larry mentioned, a holistic client centric solution to our clients. And we\u2019ve seen difficult markets before, but we think that are unique and scaled model enables us to kind of grow organically through those markets and to be able to manage our expenses appropriately, display whether they're cyclical or secular headwinds. And our view at the moment is really to continue to invest through the cycle. We see unique opportunities. Frankly, we\u2019ve done the best in these types of markets because others frankly with less diversified models are forced to pull back. And candidly, it's a lot easier to cut cost than to invest for growth, and that\u2019s really the hard part, but we think we\u2019ve got a model advantage and so our intent is to continue to invest through the cycle on behalf of our clients and our shareholders.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Bill.","William Katz","Okay, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. So, a lot of it has been answered, right, but maybe just sort of drilling into the margin discussions a bit further today. When I look at your distribution fees versus the distribution expenses, there seems to be a deeper reduction in the distribution fees than on the expenses. How much has just either divergent data or sort of mix non-US versus U.S versus maybe some of these wealth management victories you\u2019ve been getting and some elevated maybe point of sale economics against the manufacturing complex?","Gary S. Shedlin","You know, we\u2019ve seen on the distribution fees, obviously, as we\u2019ve moved away from kind of 12b-1 fees over time, and that\u2019s been going on for a long time for us now, Bill. And I think, obviously, we are moving into a more fee-based environment with all of our distribution partners trying to basically do the best they can for their clients. We\u2019ve migrated away from traditional loan products to products that don\u2019t have that. So we\u2019ve seen a decline in our distribution revenue. By virtue of FASB, we\u2019ve kind of grossed up everything. I don\u2019t think there's that much of a breakdown beyond that, other than just demand for different classes of funds are changing and driving traditional 12b-1 fees down, but beyond that, I don\u2019t think that there's anything more to it than that from our perspective.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence D. Fink","Yes. Thank you everyone for joining our call this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. Our third quarter results reflect the value of our diverse investment platform and technology capabilities provide for our clients as they navigate through this very active investment landscape. We\u2019ve built and evolved our business by staying ahead of our clients' needs and industry transformation, and we\u2019re confident that our continued differentiation, our holistic client approach will enable us to deliver growth and scale advantages over the long-term to our clients and to our shareholders. And I do believe the third quarter really did show how building these strategic relations over the long run will produce future growth tomorrow. Everyone have a good fourth quarter, and we will be talking to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3565":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Jamie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher J. Meade","Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements.","We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for this second quarter of 2018. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial information, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results.","As a reminder, all year-over-year financial comparisons referenced on this call will relate current quarter results to recast financials reflecting the adoption FASB\u2019s revenue recognition accounting standard, which became effective on January 1st.","After strong start to 2018, markets reversed mid-first quarter as escalating trade tensions, inflationary concerns and a flattening yield curve caused investors to pull back. Market uncertainty continued throughout the second quarter, reflecting ongoing global trade tensions, a slowdown in emerging markets, increased volatility and widening credit spreads. In the face of an uncertain and evolving investment landscape, clients have paused, deferring their investment decisions until they have greater clarity on the future.","Last month, at our 2018 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock's strategic differentiators, our globally integrated investment management and technology business with a comprehensive array of products and portfolio construction capabilities and unparalleled distribution reach position us to outperform, especially in times like these. Client needs for investment advice, Aladdin and digital tools are greater than ever before and we are having richer dialogues with them than at any time in our history.","Our globally diversified business model enables us to stay committed to and continually invest in our long-term strategic growth plans to ensure we are well-positioned to serve clients in any market environment. BlackRock generated $20 billion of total net inflows in the second quarter. Net inflows were positive across active, index and cash evidencing the breadth of our investment capabilities including market cap-weighted indices, factors, alpha seeking strategies and illiquid alternatives. Despite the current slowdown in industry flows, BlackRock has generated over $275 billion in total flows over the last 12 months, representing 5% total organic asset growth. ","Second quarter revenue of $3.6 billion increased 11% year-over-year, while operating income of $1.4 billion rose 16%. Earnings per share of $6.66 was up 28% compared to a year ago, driven by higher operating results and a lower effective tax rate in the current quarter.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 24%. We now estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run-rate for the remainder of 2018. However, the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on or changes to our analysis of last year's tax reform legislation.","Second quarter base fees of $2.9 billion were up 10% year-over-year, driven primarily by market appreciation and total organic base fee growth of 5% over the last 12 months. Sequentially, base fees were flat despite lower average AUM levels as a result of seasonally higher securities lending revenue and a higher day count in the second quarter.","Performance fees of $91 million increased $43 million year-over-year due to improved relative performance and loan only equity funds and our broad-based direct and solutions oriented hedge fund platform. Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies resulted in 25% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue.","Current quarter results were bolstered by the timing of several significant client go-lives. Overall, demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions, which contributes to gains in both technology services revenue and base fees. Advisory and other revenue of $78 million reflected a strong quarter for financial markets advisory services.","Our commitment to investing for future growth remains steadfast, even in more challenging markets. Total expense increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation, G&A, and volume-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $85 million or 9% year-over-year, driven primarily by higher headcount and increased incentive compensation associated with higher operating income.","Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 3%, reflecting seasonally lower employer payroll taxes. G&A expense was up $48 million year-over-year, reflecting higher levels of planned investment across a variety of categories led by continued investment in technology and portfolio services. Direct fund expense was up $43 million or 19% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher average AUM as a result of significant growth in our iShares franchise.","Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 45.2% was up a 130 basis points year-over-year. We remain margin-aware, especially in the current environment but continue to play offense in order to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. As we announced at Investor Day, we expect to see Board approval this week to increase our quarterly dividend from $2.88 per share to $3.13 per share.","On an annualized basis, this represents an increase in our dividend of $1 per share to $12.52 per share or a 25% increase from our 2017 dividend of $10 per share. We also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of common shares during the second quarter. Quarterly net inflows of $20 billion were positive in both active and index strategies as well as in our cash management business.","Global iShares generated quarterly net inflows of $18 billion, driven by continued strong demand from long-term investors in our core franchise. Flows into higher fee non-core iShares have slowed during the year as market uncertainty has impacted investors\u2019 tactical risk allocation decisions.","Retail net inflows of $5 billion were paced by flows into active fixed income, our multi-asset income fund and our event-driven liquid alternative fund. Equity net outflows were primarily associated with products investing in non-U.S. equities and natural resources.","Institutional net outflows of $9 billion resulted from both significant inflow and outflow activity during the quarter as various clients derisked, rebalanced or sought liquidity in the current environment. Despite net outflows, institutional clients drove positive annualized organic base fee growth in the quarter, driven in part by mix shift associated with higher fee active products.","Institutional index net outflows of $13 billion reflected significant derisking activity in the passive equity book, partially offset by continued demand for LDI fixed income solutions. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by multi-asset net inflows of $8 billion, led by continued demand for our target date offerings. Fixed income net outflows of $3 billion reflected continued cash repatriation activity and client losses associated with insurance-related M&A transactions.","Illiquid alternative fund raising momentum continued with an additional $2 billion in commitments raised during the second quarter. We also announced the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners scheduled to close in the third quarter, augmenting our position as a leading, global credit asset manager, and advancing our goal of providing clients with a diverse range of alternate investment products and solutions to meet their evolving needs.","Finally, despite a difficult quarter for the cash management industry driven by both seasonal and repatriated quarterly tax payments, BlackRock\u2019s cash management business saw net inflows of $6 billion as our product breadth, scale and technology-first distribution strategy is resonating with clients and leading to differentiated business performance.","We have managed our business through market volatility and uncertainty at various times over the past few years. During each instance, we remained intensely focused on strategically positioning ourselves for long-term growth.","Our strong and resilient platform enables us to continue investing prudently in our fastest growing opportunities and extending our value proposition in those areas where we are already market leaders.","With that, I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining the call. After a strong close to 2017 and equity markets reaching all-time highs in January, volatility has remained elevated in the second quarter as clients recalibrated their risk.","Political uncertainty has ramped up again. Governments are changing hands in Italy and Mexico, and further questions around other elections and policy decisions continue to challenge investors\u2019 confidence.","Most significantly, some of the strongest foundational components of international investing are being tested as trade frictions escalate to new levels. Strong earnings and the U.S. economic growth unfortunately are being offset by heightened uncertainty due to rising protectionism and potential barriers to the open markets and free trades that have been for years supported global economic growth and the expansion of international markets. These circumstances are impacting markets, exchange rates, and global capital flows. Additionally, companies are using excess capital to make acquisitions and more aggressively repurchasing shares at levels not seen since 2007, and the pool of investable equities is shrinking.","Over time, the supply and demand dynamic should be positive for the markets but the current market environment has not rewarded such corporate behavior as it has in the past.","If you strip out a handful of outperforming tech stocks, the lack of breadth in the equity markets is troubling. We are at a pivotal point. Clients are struggling to better understand increased risk and uncertainty, and market dynamics are shifting, causing those clients to pause as they think about the future. Short term rates have now surpassed 2%, a level not seen in almost 10 years.","These rising rates and a flattening curve have made cash not a safe place but now also a more profitable place for investors to stand by and wait. While investors\u2019 caution has impacted industry flows, BlackRock continues to benefit from the value of our diverse global investment and technology platform. Revenues increased 11%, operating income increased 16%, and our earnings per share increased 28% year-over-year.","We generated $20 billion of total net inflows, positive across active index and cash in the second quarter. We have seen markets and uncertainty like this before. As clients globally grapple with this uncertainty, they\u2019re reaching out to BlackRock with more frequency, with more momentum. The dialogues with the clients to date have never been stronger. We believe that the long-term trends at BlackRock is strategically positioned to address -- remain intact. The investments we have made to strengthen our index, our active and alternative platforms, and our investments in portfolio construction, asset allocation and distribution technologies position us to deepen relationships and partnerships with both institutional and wealth clients.","We remain focus on investing in BlackRock\u2019s future to stay ahead of our clients\u2019 needs and capture the most impactful long-term industry opportunities. This means constantly improving our investment platform and technology, becoming more global and more local in the markets where we operate and taking advantage of our scale to serve our clients better and deliver more value to our shareholders.","As institutional clients around the world react to market movements and uncertainties, activity has been elevated year-to-date with growth flows up substantially relative to the same period last year. However, while clients have shifted assets within investment strategies, they have been hesitant to put new assets to work and net flows have been more muted as a result.","Similar to last quarter, the ongoing impact of U.S. tax reform also influenced institutional client behavior in the second quarter. A number of U.S. based clients saw liquidity from index equity allocations to fund share repurchases and M&A. Pension clients are looking to outsource our investment responsibilities in an increasingly complex investment landscape, which is driving momentum in our outsourced CIO business, both in the United States and internationally.","We\u2019re also seeing strong momentum in LDI discussions as a combination of rising rates and resilient equity markets levels create incentives for clients to immunize their portfolios. Our commitment to delivering a differentiated long-term retirement solution to corporate clients is also generating results. We continue to see interest in our asset allocation and customized target date capabilities. LifePath, our target date service -- series has generated $8 billion in net inflows in the quarter, representing 17% annualized organic growth.","This quarter, adoption of ETFs at the core of the investors\u2019 portfolios drove $18 billion in net inflows into iShares. And BlackRock once again captured the number one share of global ETF flows year-to-date. Because buy and hold clients positioning their portfolio for the long-term, they tend to be less sensitive to interquarter volatility than liquidity-driven users of ETFs.","We have strategically invested to provide high-quality index exposures with a range of value propositions for our clients. We are confident in the long-term secular growth opportunities for ETFs, and we believe that the global ETF market can reach between $10 and trillion $12 trillion in assets by the end of 2023.","Growth will be driven by core and non-core products. Institutions are increasingly using ETFs as alpha generation tools and replacement for futures and swaps both in equities and fixed income exposures. And world clients globally are using ETFs in fee-based ecosystems.","Wealth managers are increasingly using models in their fee-based advisory businesses. And the nature of BlackRock's relationships with wealth managers and advisors is becoming more and more similar to the deep holistic engagements we have with our institutional clients.","Our ability to provide clients with digital tools and whole portfolio solutions drove $5 billion of retail net inflows in the second quarter. This represents our sixth consecutive inflow quarter and growing momentum with financial advisors who are leveraging BlackRock's technology to manage risk and construct portfolios using both ETFs and our active mutual funds.","Inflows were driven by our strong demand and our top performing active fixed income strategies where we generated $2 billion of net flows, each at our municipal bonds and our unconstrained strategies. Our unconstrained fixed income franchise in the U.S. and globally are particularly well-positioned for a rising rate environment.","We achieved the number one position in gathering active fixed income flows for the quarter in the United States wealth space where we are delivering strong performance at good value with 88% of our assets are top performing and lowest priced quartile. The strength of BlackRock's fixed income platform reflects the team's use of Aladdin technology, sophisticated risk analytics, and scenario testing tools across diverse offerings of products from short duration to unconstrained.","Performance across fixed income strategies remained strong at the end of the quarter, 78% of our tax flow fixed income assets were above benchmark or peer median for one year period. Our active equities, 59% of our fundamental and 86% of our systematic active equity assets were above benchmark or peer medians for one year period. Strong performance is the foundation for delivering client outcomes and driving net inflows.","In alternatives, we\u2019re seeing more momentum in fund raisings than any point in BlackRock's history. Over the last few years, we've invested both organically and inorganically to build a comprehensive and differentiated alternative platform supported by robust sourcing capabilities, investment expertise and skilled distribution. We\u2019re beginning to see the benefits of these investments through strong performance across our platform, especially in infrastructure and private credit which are key focus areas for BlackRock and position us well in leading illiquid alternative space.","We raised $2 billion in flows and $2 billion in additional commitments in our illiquid alternative business in the second quarter. During the quarter, we closed our European middle market private debt strategy with over $1 billion in commitments, which represents significant progress in establishing a leading global private credit platform and further expanding our capabilities in Europe.","We also announced the first close of our third global energy and power infrastructure fund last week with $1.5 billion in commitments from a diverse global set of clients. The strong first close reinforces our position as the leading energy and power investment platform in the industry. And we continue to make progress in our long-term private capital strategy. We are seeing tremendous client interest for a structure that aligns with their long-term goals.","Cash management is another area where we are gaining share. And we now manage $457 billion in cash assets. The cash strategy is earning between approximately 2 and 2.5%, levels not seen in the past decade. Clients are using cash as not only as a safe asset but one that provides attractive returns, especially in this market environment. BlackRock generated $6 billion in net inflows and cash strategies in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our global scale and tech-enabled distribution. This highlights one of the true benefits and differentiators of BlackRock\u2019s diverse business model.","Technology is also a strategic differentiator and one of our largest priorities at BlackRock. Asset managers, wealth managers and custodial banks globally are rethinking their business models and looking for ways to operate more efficiently. Insurers and banks are facing regulatory consolidation in involving regulatory requirements. These changes are driving increased demand for BlackRock\u2019s broad-based technology services, and digital tools like Institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Wealth, Provider Aladdin and Cachematrix.","For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment management system, powering the entire investment process on a single platform, from portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution, to compliance to investment operations. It is also a powerful solution for custodians who service those assets through Provider Aladdin, as well as wealth for managers through Aladdin Wealth, bringing sophisticated institutional tools to the broad, wealth management community.","Aladdin continues to benefit from those trends favoring global scale, multi-asset solutions and operating efficiency and simplicity. Our technology services revenues grew 25% year-over-year, reflecting an outsized number of institutional clients going live on the Aladdin platform in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in the low to mid teens range going forward. We are focused on near-term opportunities to partner with clients on their technology needs and investing in longer term opportunities in artificial intelligence and data science to enhance the way we and our clients invest, the way we distribute and how we operate.","I want to by saying we\u2019ve seen these markets like this before that have caused investors to pause. But we believe that we are better prepared today to meet client needs than ever before. This is reflective in the depth, the quality of the dialogue we are having with clients across the globe. Indeed, we believe that in markets like these, clients put an even greater premium on the differentiating value proposition that BlackRock can offer them.","With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Bill Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So, Larry, I\u2019d like to sort of circle back to your technology discussion. It seems like a very nice ramp quarter-on-quarter, year-on-year. When you think about your guidance of low to mid teens from here, is the second quarter -- and you said -- I think you said, there were few things that sort of turned on during the quarter. Is this a good start point for that assumption or is there sort of further momentum into the second half of the year to which we then sort of build to that low to mid teens growth rate into \u201819?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, we tend to use that as a baseline. I am going to let Gary answer with the more specifics. But, as I said in my prepared remarks, we -- some of the wins we had a year ago and two years ago, depending on how long these conversions took, went live. And I am very pleased to say two very large institutional clients went live and so the ramp rate is higher. The dialogues we are having for Aladdin and all technology solutions is growing, but I think it\u2019s fair that we haven\u2019t adjusted yet our run rate. And I will let Gary go into that a little more.","Gary S. Shedlin","Well, I think Larry, I think you answered it. I think it\u2019s -- the question of obviously what\u2019s there becomes the rate going forward but the sequential and the year-over-year increases obviously then change as a function of timing. So, as Larry said, the growth this quarter of 25% year-over-year did reflect an outsized number of significant institutional clients going live on the platform and the platform will continue to benefit. The other smaller item obviously that will come into play is we closed our Cachematrix deal in July of 2017, which we obviously benefited from the timing of that revenue related to other periods. So, that revenue will now be in both periods\u2019 time as we think about year-over-year changes.","Laurence D. Fink","I would just add one more thing related to this. The demand for Aladdin services and all technology services is growing across the board. And in my conversations worldwide, I\u2019m hearing more and more clients are looking to add Aladdin services. But I think for run rate as Gary and I both said that it\u2019s a good level as a benchmark. ","Gary S. Shedlin","We\u2019ll continue to say this, probably answered a couple questions. But as we -- I think we\u2019ve always said, we don\u2019t believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons are the best way to think of our business. We think we tend to look at longer periods of time. And if you look at 12 months versus 12 months on a LTM basis for Aladdin, it\u2019s up closer to 18%, which is much more in line with our focus going forward.","Laurence D. Fink","Yes. But the momentum is strong.","Gary S. Shedlin","Absolutely.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","So, it looks like the slowdown in European flows is more of an industry issue than anything BlackRock specific. Can you just give us your thoughts on the softness? And maybe any perspective on this -- if this is a shorter term issue or a longer term problem?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, some of it has been outflows from U.S. based investors that had their money overseas and they were investing in European products. So, when we had tax reform and they repatriated the money, you\u2019re seeing that in the flows. Two, there still remains to be in some of the sovereign wealth funds, some de-risking that occurred in the second quarter. And you\u2019re seeing some clients taking profits because of the value of the dollar, the dollar appreciated quite well in the second quarter. So, you\u2019re seeing many different diversion trends. But, I would say -- I don\u2019t have enough information to tell you, if it\u2019s a one quarter event. But I just came back from Europe spending quite a bit of time there. The opportunities in Europe, the broad conversation we\u2019re having with some of the very large European and Middle Eastern clients is strong as ever. In some cases, some of them have pause because of the tension related to trade. But, I would say, over a long period of time, the growth trends are intact. And I would say we\u2019re seeing outcomes of repatriation of cash, strong dollar and just global uncertainty. But, let\u2019s be clear, the dialogues are deeper than ever.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with the Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Just going back to the Aladdin discussion for a second, I was wondering if you guys could give us an update on the progress Aladdin for wealth is making. Again, any metrics you guys can put around them will be helpful. Whether it\u2019s client assets that are already in the platform and I guess any sense what sort of AUM contribution you guys have had, maybe over the last 12 months from Aladdin for wealth?","Robert S. Kapito","So, this is a great new platform for us, because what we\u2019re doing is giving wealth managers the ability to analyze their portfolios, utilizing all of the technology that we have built in Aladdin, so that they can suggest better risk and better returns, and instead of 100 portfolios, 500 portfolios. So, this is becoming a very, very big business. There are over 7,000 individual advisors that are now using this. And as we're building this out, their requests for more and more technology is quite significant and we're building that in. So, this is going to be something that I think will help and that they will be utilizing their models, some people will be utilizing our models. We will be comparing the products they have in their clients' portfolios to better products that they might have in their portfolios, suggesting that they might not only use our products but other people's products to better the portfolios.","So, this is a way to take what we're doing for our institutional clients and get deeper into solutions for the individual investor, but it's a business-to-business where we're utilizing this to help our distributors create better solutions for their clients. So, we're excited about this. We have several firms that have already signed on to this. It's going to take us a while to implement this. And also it takes us a while to get people to actually use it, even though it is implemented.","So, we're very excited about this, very excited about the future of it. And again, following up on Larry's comments, it gives us the ability to have more holistic conversations with the wider group of clients and in this case, the retail clients or wealth management clients, which we're seeing a lot of flow from especially this quarter.","Laurence D. Fink","Alex, let me just add one more thing. I think Rob said it very clearly, Aladdin Wealth takes maybe as long as one to two years like of conversion to get our retail wealth management clients to utilize them and to affect it. But one thing that we are hearing very loud, the advisors are looking for better client understanding and portfolio understanding; they're looking for better transparency; they\u2019re looking for better tools to navigate the clients' money with better consistency; they're using, as Rob said, more models and having Aladdin Wealth allow them to navigate this. And so, if anything, we are seeing greater demand for these types of products because it simplifies the process, it creates a better environment for investing a better environment for compliance and compliance review, and importantly, it allows the advisors and the firm to better understand all of their clients risks in comparing the risks associated with all the portfolios and making sure that those portfolios are meeting the needs of each and everyone's client portfolios.","This plays into our strength. This gives us a great opportunity to be more connected with our distribution partners. And we're providing what I would say, the most-clear thing, a differentiating value proposition. So, it's not just about a product, it is providing them with a better enterprise solution to deal with their client issues more effectively with greater transparency.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Good morning. It seems like we're seeing a greater use of commission-free platforms for the distribution of ETFs. So, Schwab has built its ETF platform from scratch using this approach, more recently we\u2019ve seen expanded use of commission-free ETF trading by both Ameritrade and Vanguard. So, I guess, maybe Larry, what do you think of these move to commission-free trading and ETS? And is this sort of the next evolution in ETF competition?","Robert S. Kapito","Sure. This is -- I think it\u2019s actually positive for us and that the more people that are aware of ETFs, the better; the more people that have access to the ETFs, the better. So, we are the manufacturer here. And if there is a cheaper way that these groups want to distribute ETFs, quite frankly, it benefits us. So, I think for the distributors, it\u2019s a competitive process that they\u2019re going to have to step up to the plate like we do, because price and value is certainly one of the aspects of ETFs. But for us with the largest market share, the more people are distributing and buying ETFs, the better.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Dan.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. Can you discuss the multi-asset flows in a bit more detail? You talked about LifePath, I think seeing around $8 billion. I guess, can you just discuss momentum in that business more broadly and how to think about kind of the growth in that business or that segment going forward?","Gary S. Shedlin","Sure, Dan. So, I think there is no question that there are really two or three big drivers of multi-asset flows in the quarter. And one thing I want to just say right at the outset is I think we\u2019ve said before and I think you know very well, it\u2019s important not to conflate the multi-asset line items that you see on our financial reconciliation tables to the broader theme of outcome-oriented investing and solutions. But the multi-asset line item did see 8 billion of flows in the quarter. As you mentioned, continued demand for target data offerings including one significant custom target date solution for a large client. In addition, strong flows into MAI or multi-asset income fund and factor based strategies of about $1 billion each.","That being said, we do continue to see outflows from our global allocation fund. That was about $3 billion in the second quarter. And I think as we\u2019ve mentioned before that that is relevant, not as it relates necessarily to the flow itself but we do note that obviously global allo has a higher fee than LifePath does and that obviously creates some drag on fee rate and overall revenue growth. But otherwise, we\u2019re continuing to invest and believe very strongly in multi-asset category in and of itself and broader portfolio construction that pulls together lots of different parts of the BlackRock organization into client models and solutions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning. How are you? You saw some pretty punchy losses in longer dated core bond products in the second quarter. Could you speak to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of client conversations in terms of movement within the bond category, and if you\u2019re seeing maybe a pipeline of running from the hills from a longer dated stuff at this point?","Laurence D. Fink","I don\u2019t think it was that bigger of outflows. I think it was -- I'm getting the number right now, but at least, $2 billion or less. We saw $26 billion of fixed income of flows. I think in long duration, it\u2019s a function of investors\u2019 belief over the long run that inflation is going to increase, maybe reserves are going to continue to be tightening, and there is greater value in the short end at this momentum than a long end.","I think, when you look at the fixed income universe, it\u2019s many different opportunities. And there are many times when you see clients moving out of long end into short end or short end into long end. I don\u2019t believe there is any real dramatic change. I think, we did see emerging outflows and that\u2019s intermediate type of level of outflows. But, I don\u2019t think there was anything extraordinary in fixed income at all in the second quarter. If anything, if the trends continue, inflows -- in the short duration, inflows and unconstrained, and I think that continues to be the trend. And we continue -- now this is more intermediate again, we continue to see some very strong gains in municipals and that\u2019s around the 10-year maturity, so -- 7 to 10-year. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big trend. Rob?","Robert S. Kapito","So, Patrick, the only trend is what Larry mentioned in his opening remarks is that today, you can get as good a yield in a combination of risk-free assets and risk assets, as you can get in just risk assets. So, therefore, the flows that we\u2019ve seen which are appropriate considering where interest rates are and where the risk-free rate has gone that people would come out of high yield and emerging markets because they are not getting compensated enough relative to risk-free rates. So, it wouldn\u2019t be longer term and shorter term, it would just be riskier assets versus risk-free assets. And there, we saw the flows. And when that changes, we see the flows the other way. So we\u2019re not worried about it. It\u2019s really market-oriented and it\u2019s those people that are investing for the short term versus the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Michael Cyprys","Great. So, thanks for taking the question. Just curious if we see true tariff wars emerge, what do you think the impact could on asset flows, where do you think we could see money fall out of in terms of asset classes, geographies and where do you think it flows into?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, it\u2019ll flow more into dollar-based assets, generally we would see strengthening of the dollar. So, we would probably see some more dollar flows in the short run. In the long run, it may be negative. It really depends on if we had a real tariff war, does that disrupt the accelerated GDP growth that the U.S. is experiencing from tax reform. Does it create more uncertainties? But, if it doesn\u2019t, if we don\u2019t have at all outright tariff war that\u2019s increased from this point now, I would say equity markets are cheaper today than they were in January where we\u2019ve had great corporate earnings, record M&A, record amount of stock purchases. So, the amount of underlying equities has shrunk, and PEs have reduced. Now PEs are reduced from the year-to-date level from -- because of the global uncertainty. So, if there is more positive clarification that doesn\u2019t lead to tariff wars, then the markets would probably reassert itself quite strongly. And if there is a tariff war, some of it\u2019s priced into the market, some of it\u2019s not. I would say, Michael that there\u2019s some asymmetry here. I think there\u2019s probably a little more upside right now than downside. But, let\u2019s be clear. If it\u2019s a trade, leads to a reduction in future GDP, then the market will have a setback. But as I said, PEs have fallen from the beginning of the year. So, the market is trying to digest all this as we speak. So, I\u2019m pretty calm about it.","But one thing I\u2019ll say, and I said this in my prepared remarks, I have never witnessed more client conversations around this uncertainty, and the opportunities we have with some of the clients today are as large as ever. We\u2019re having deeper conversation, broader conversations on clients on relooking at their risk on how to design their portfolios in these different types of scenarios. And probably the most important thing I could say is more and more clients are coming to BlackRock.","Operator","Your next question is from line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI.","Kaimon Chung","Hi. This is Kaimon Chung in for Glenn Schorr. I think your margin improvement in not too greatest environment, great to see. And I heard you\u2019re margin-aware and playing offensive for growth comments. But do you think you held back on any of the spending during the quarter and in particular G&A is up 20% year-over-year?","Laurence D. Fink","No.","Kaimon Chung","No?","Laurence D. Fink","No. I\u2019m going to let Gary get into the details. We have not adjusted our spending related to investing in our future. We are going to continue to invest in our future to stay in front of our clients\u2019 needs. I think what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the margin expansion is, our investments in the past from technology is created better efficiencies, and we\u2019re able to do more with less. Gary?","Gary S. Shedlin","So, thanks, Larry. So, I would just echo a couple things. One is I agree with Larry. We really are spending right now what we planned on spending when we went into the beginning of this year. We\u2019re obviously trying to be more thoughtful as to spending in the places we get the greatest impact in the current market. So, there\u2019s obviously always reallocation and rethinking as to what we want do with that spend. But, I think there\u2019s no question that our heads are up, our eyes are forward, and we\u2019re continuing to play offense in the market and continuing to invest in all of the strategic initiatives that we\u2019ve talked at length with you about and discussed again at Investor Day. So, illiquids, factors portfolio construction, technology across the board, as Larry said in terms of alpha generation, digital distribution, our own operating platform, continuing to think smartly about investing in regions, especially in the current environment where maybe even more important than ever to be local in key markets. And so, I think that\u2019s exactly right.","On the other hand, again, as I echoed when we talked about our technology, growth from a year-over-year perspective. Quarterly margins are obviously -- we are -- even in positive markets, we would basically ask you to look at the trends overall. I think the trend over the last 12 months has been closer to around 80 basis points of margin improvement rather than what we saw this quarter. And so, spend will change on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And again, I think, looking at longer term trends is much more indicative of our operating leverage than necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Laurence D. Fink","As we constantly say, we're margin-aware.","Gary S. Shedlin","Especially in this environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Hey. Good morning, everyone. I guess, my -- well, question maybe will have A and B. But, while we always talk about kind of organic growth from a flow perspective, I guess, what really matters is really the flow contribution to the bottom line. So, I guess with that in mind, can you maybe give a little bit of sense on how -- I mean, I know you don't want to focus too much on just one quarter, but if we kind a look at the mix, I think you kind of hinted that at a little bit. But how would you characterize kind of the bottom line contribution of flows this quarter and maybe how that compares to where it\u2019s been last several quarters.","Gary S. Shedlin","Yes. Rob, thanks. Good question. So, obviously, as we saw investors pause amidst uncertainty in flows, specifically -- when we looked at what caused some of those slowdown in flows this quarter, we did see a slowdown in our organic based fee growth for the quarter. I would say that that slowdown was primarily driven by a client shift and sentiment on equities. We did see strength in alternatives. We did see strength in fixed income. Though there was a shift to shorter duration fixed income, and that does come with a bit of a lower fee, more broadly.","If we look at equities, as Larry mentioned, we saw strong growth in core iShares but less momentum in higher fee non-core exposures versus what we\u2019ve seen historically and in particular outflows in EEM, which is our flagship liquid emerging markets offering as well as in Europe, Japan and some non-U.S. developed markets in equities on a base-fee growth. If we think about those funds, clearly are relatively higher fee than the core.","I think we additionally saw some slower active equity flows, particularly in Europe and Asia, which frankly is an area of strength for us from a performance standpoint. And as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past in our discussions, divergent beta and FX, those carry higher fee rates. But again, I think we feel really confident that the broader platform is going to do what it's going to do. As Larry mentioned, we're having stronger and deeper conversation with our clients. And as this uncertainty passes, we're pretty convinced that we're right where we need to be when the client activity kicks back in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. ","Brennan Hawken","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just had one, hopefully throw little bit of greater color on the sec lending side, strong this quarter, highlighted some seasonality. But, it was up year-over-year as well. And we're hearing that regulatory changes in Europe have sort of softened to some of the traditional seasonality. So, maybe could you give a little bit of color on what you're seeing there? And is it volume versus spread dynamic? How should we think about that here this quarter?","Laurence D. Fink","It\u2019s actually both. When we have record amount of M&A there, it produces more volume, or stocks are on special. In addition, when you have higher rates, it\u2019s partially rates. And also, I do believe because of our position, because of the stable nature of our platform, and our investible assets or the assets that can be lent, we are able to command premium rates also because of the nature of the stability of these type of assets we have. And we made this as a major component of the value proposition that we provide to our iShares investors and to our index investors and we\u2019re able to generate better returns for them. And in many cases because of the strength and the power of BlackRock sec lending business, we\u2019re able to provide products after fees positive to the index.","Gary S. Shedlin","So Brennan, specifically to your question on a sequential basis where we saw sec lending up about 18%, I would say that it is definitely both a price and volume as Larry mentioned. I mean, the book was up but frankly, sequentially spreads were up more, and that helped drive it. And I think part of that was increasing rates. So, we saw asset spreads going up. And part of it obviously is just increased demand for specials, which I think is partly seasonal that you see in Europe but also just the fact that the M&A environment is up significantly is helping our business.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, let me thank everybody for joining us this morning. As I said in my prepared remarks earlier, we have seen markets like this before, we\u2019ve seen customers and clients pause but I think we\u2019re better prepared today to meet the clients\u2019 needs than ever before and the opportunities in front of us have not been greater.","Our second quarter results reflect the value that our diverse investment and technology platform provide for clients as they invest to achieve their long-term goals. We are confident that continued differentiation that BlackRock provides will enable us to deliver the growth that our shareholders ask of us and the scale opportunities over the long run to help both our clients and our shareholders. And I believe that is intact and the opportunities in front of us are as great as ever. Have a good quarter, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. First (sic) [Second] Quarter 2012 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thank you very much. Good morning, all. This is Matt Mallow. I am the General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks, let me point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual future results may differ from these statements, and as you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports which list some of the factors which may cause those future results to differ materially from what we say today. Finally, BlackRock assumes and you should understand that we assume no duty to and do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll get out of the way and turn it over to Ann Marie.","Ann Marie Petach","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone. As we saw in this quarter, volatile markets, driven in part by political, policy and regulatory uncertainty, continued. Until confidence increases, investors are biased towards short-term defense [ph]. We saw this evidenced in the second quarter based on investor preferences for income products and liquid instruments such as ETF. World markets continued to fare worse than U.S. markets. Compared to the first quarter, the U.S. markets were, on average, relatively flat, while global, European and emerging markets were down 3% to 6%. Despite these market challenges, BlackRock delivered a strong 39.2% operating margin and delivered operating results that were up compared to the first quarter. Our financial performance highlights our strong focus on clients' needs and our ability to work with them, supported by the breadth of our product set, our global presence and our unmatched risk tools.","BRS is continuing to grow as risk, insights and tools are in ever-increasing demand. Our commitment to our brand has helped us connect to our clients at a time when they need and want advice more than ever. Our cost discipline has supported our strong operating margins. We remain committed to long-term growth opportunities, and you saw this evidenced in our announced acquisition of Swiss Re's private equity fund of funds platform.","The second quarter also allowed us to continue our journey of transforming the ownership of the firm. Post the May secondary offering of Barclays shares, the ownership of the firm is almost 80% broadly held, and that compares to 20% just 18 months ago. The Barclays secondary offering was a great opportunity to communicate with investors about our organic growth opportunities and to take advantage of the cash-generative nature of our business model. We participated in the Barclays sale via a $1 billion, 6.4 million share repurchase, which was incremental to our core repurchase program. After the secondary closed, we resumed our regular repurchase program and were able to purchase an additional 250,000 shares in the few remaining non-blackout days in the quarter. Going forward, returning cash to shareholders regularly remains a priority.","We also took advantage of a robust debt market and the secondary investor roadshow to lock in $1.5 billion of term debt at historically attractive rates. The key takeaway for me is that our breadth and diversity have positioned us to perform well in various market environments and to consistently reward shareholders.","I'm going to walk through the specific results now. As I make my comments, I'll refer to the slides in the earnings supplement, which you can find on our website. And I'm going to be talking primarily about as adjusted results.","So if you look at the supplement, I'm going to start on Slide 3, second quarter earnings per share of $3.10 reflected year-over-year EPS growth of 3% and sequential operating income growth of 1%. I just want to contrast the as adjusted results to the GAAP results which are presented in the headlines of net income down 11% and remind people that in the second quarter of 2011, we benefited from a $52 million noncash tax benefit, really, the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities. Because it was noncash, we never took credit for this benefit in our as adjusted results because we didn't think it really benefited our shareholders. So the way we look at it, it really is a 3% increase in net income.","Moving to Slide 4, our second quarter operating margin was 39.2%. Cost discipline and seasonal factors allowed us to improve the margin 0.60 point sequentially despite the market-related revenue pressure and an increase in marketing expense associated with the commitment to our brand. Our cost-to-revenue ratio was 35.1%. That's exactly in line with the 35% we've been running for several years.","The next slide, Slide 5, is something we pulled ahead that had been in the appendix last quarter. We think it's an important slide because it highlights the diversity of our business, as well as the dramatic difference in business mix as measured when you use revenue compared to when you use AUM. From a base fee perspective, we're an evenly balanced business, with about 1\/3 of our revenue coming from institutional, 1\/3 from retail and 1\/3 from iShares, while the AUM view really distorts the business mix and be dominated by institutional.","Slide 6 shows the decline in average global markets compared to both a year ago and to first quarter. While U.S. markets are up on average 2% compared to a year ago and flat compared to the first quarter, the global markets across various indices were down 7% to 17% compared to a year ago and 3% to 6% below the first quarter. Reflective of the diversity of our business, about half our equity AUM is tied to non-U.S. markets, so these markets obviously affected our revenues. I'll start with a comparison of our results compared to a year ago, and then I'll move on to the sequential results.","On Slide 8, on the right-hand side, you can see that earnings per share of $3.10 included $3.27 of operating earnings and $0.17 of nonoperating expense. Operating EPS benefited from expense discipline and share repurchases offsetting market effects. Nonoperating results reflected a stable investment portfolio and higher interest expense. The year-to-date as adjusted tax rate was 30.4%. The improvement compared to the first quarter reflected the positive resolution of certain outstanding tax positions and reductions in our foreign tax rate. 31% is a good modeling level for the rest of the year based on what we know right now.","Operating earnings of $832 million, which you can see on Slide 9, reflected expense discipline more than offset by market-related revenue declines, which we'll move on to on the next slide. Our business does benefit from the diversified set of revenues. Second quarter revenues were $2.2 billion. This includes $2 billion of base fees, $41 million of performance fees and $131 million of BRS revenues. Market factors drove the decline in long-dated base fees, which is that red bar. BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues of $131 million were up 13%. That's driven by a 21% increase in our core Aladdin revenues. And as we've said in the past, Aladdin revenues represent the bulk, about 2\/3, of the BRS revenues and are very sticky. Once people get on Aladdin, really, they stay. Our managed disposition of assets in Maiden Lane I and III has broadly benefited U.S. taxpayers as those funds have been fully paid with interest earlier than originally expected. This is the key driver of the $68 billion decrease in advisory assets compared to a year ago. The appetite for BRS remains very strong, allowing us to continue great dialogue with our clients, both regarding advisory, as well as Aladdin, and this is a global phenomenon at this point.","Looking at base fees on Slide 11, revenues are benefiting from our balanced business model and product offerings. While the material declines in world equity markets more than explain the 11% decline in base fees on equity assets compared to 2011, this has been muted by an 8% revenue increase on fixed income and multi-asset class revenues. So you see the strength of the balanced business model coming through. Also compared to a year ago, we saw the revenue effect of withdrawals from really very low-yielding cash products.","Now turning to Slide 12, expense discipline resulted in a 5% decrease in as adjusted expenses. G&A was down 6% as we reduced the occupancy cost associated with 2011 double rents and more than offset our branding investment. Our branding initiative resulted in only a 14% increase in marketing cost as other year-over-year marketing efficiencies offset a portion of the branding expense. We've been really encouraged by the client reaction to the campaign. We've gotten some great initial feedback on the number of people who really recognize our name post the campaign, and so we remain highly confident that this is a critical long-term investment in the business that's going to pay off over time.","Compensation expense was down 3%. That's explained by decreases in incentive comp and temporary help. Larry's going to discuss our continued investment in and commitment to great talent.","Moving on to sequential results and beginning on Slide 14 now, sequentially, EPS benefited from a $0.17 increase in operating EPS, but that was more than offset by a $0.23 decrease in nonoperating EPS. The nonoperating EPS reflected that the value of the investment portfolio was stable this quarter, whereas in the first quarter, the value of the investment portfolio actually increased. So it's a non-repeat of an increase in the first quarter.","Operating income, improvements in sequential operating income were driven by the same themes really driving the year-over-year result plus seasonal factors, which I'm going to be getting into as I move on to Slide 16.","If you look on the left side, starting with base fees, $46 million of the improvement in base fees was associated with the seasonal increase and securities lending associated with the European dividends season. So despite negative markets, we delivered a $13 million improvement in base fees. BRS revenues increased 7%, while performance fees declined, reflecting both a trend of lower performance fees in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and volatile performance in a volatile period. In these markets, we've got some funds performing very well, but also, we have funds that are volatile in a volatile market. Some of our larger hedge funds have moved up or down multiple percentage points over days or weeks, and this leaves us highly uncertain exactly where the funds will be relative to high watermarks on the last date. We can talk more about that next quarter as the vast majority, the biggest number of loss is in the fourth quarter, though some are in the third quarter.","As discussed earlier, a strong appetite for income products led to a $25 million improvement in fixed income base fees, which you can see on Slide 17, while the seasonal factors we just talked about supported growth in equity index base fees.","Expenses on Slide 18 are down 2% sequentially, reflecting the seasonal benefit of lower payroll taxes, which peaked in the first quarter, and lower incentive comp, offset partially by our brand initiative, which you can see in the G&A expense.","Slide 20 shows our nonoperating expense of $43 million, which, in this quarter, reflected $44 million of net interest expense. Including the interest on the $1.5 billion of incremental debt that we issued in May, the value of the investment portfolio, as you can see, was completely stable, with gains offsetting losses. The purpose of the portfolio is for us to seed new product and co-invest with our clients. And just to give you some data on the benefits of those seedings, funds that we seeded since fourth quarter 2011, specifically, we seeded a multi-asset income fund, an emerging markets fund and a global long\/short fund, have provided great new investment options for our clients and gathered over $800 million in new assets in this short period. So we're really seeing the fruits of the seeding. Our balance sheet remains small, with approximately $8 billion of economic tangible assets composed of cash, receivables and the seed and co-investment portfolio.","Moving on to 21 and summing up, we delivered a healthy margin. We generated strong operating cash flow, returned a large amount of cash to shareholders and transformed the ownership of the firm. Looking ahead, we're extremely excited about opportunities we have to help our clients navigate this challenging environment and help them to balance between near-term unknowns and long-term opportunities. Our balanced business model, client focus and commitment to long-term growth are benefiting the business. Near term, we're well positioned to service clients' immediate needs, risk appetite and desire for liquidity and products such as ETF. We're also well positioned to work with our clients in the long term as risk appetite and the need for returns balance out. Our commitment to alternatives remains strong, as evidenced in our announced acquisition to private equity -- of the private equity fund of funds business, though you have to recognize in this environment and also in these asset classes that decision-making time frames have lengthened. These are long decision -- longer-term decisions for people. So this opportunity is going to play out over time. We think it's a very important opportunity which will generate strong results both for our clients and for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry, who will discuss the external environment, what we're seeing with our clients and our focus on performance.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Thanks, Ann Marie. Welcome, everyone. While the first 2 months of 2012 started with a lot of optimism, we, like the rest of the industry, witnessed the softening in our net new business beginning in March and lasting through the quarter end. I've discussed this quite a bit, the risk on and risk off, and I think the issues going on right now with all the uncertainty, which I'll talk about, has really created a change in attitude by investors as they are trying to redetermine how they should think about their portfolios, which I'll talk about quite a bit later.","As Ann Marie suggested, global markets were down from the last quarter and down even more dramatically from a year ago, with the MSCI Barra World Index average in the second quarter down about 7.4% from a year ago. This uncertainty continues to be fueled by the fragility of the European banking sector, by the European sovereign debt issue and also the overall economic situation throughout the world today that includes China. This has put investors in a more of a defensive nature, and it is our job and we are spending a great deal of time with our clients in trying to help them think about how they should think about these issues. We all know where the safe haven assets are. They're in U.S. treasuries. They're in boons [ph]. U.S. treasuries today are trading below 1.5%. Boons [ph], at quarter end, ended at 1.58%. So we're talking about extraordinary low yield levels. We're talking about yield levels that are -- that cannot meet the long-term objectives of anybody. So the global growth -- so these safe havens over the long run may not be true safe havens. Global growth maintains muted. The most recent data from Bloomberg indicates that the real annualized GDP growth in the first quarter turned flat in the Eurozone, remained sluggish in the United States between 1.7% and 2.2% and fell to a level that people didn't think was going to happen in China, with China falling to a 7.6% growth rate, down from the first quarter of something close to 8.1%.","This uncertain climate has shortened the horizons for decision-making and short -- and shaken the confidence of investors worldwide. But not only just investors have been shaken, I do believe CEO attitudes have been shaken by this. This is a big change from our perspective from 2011. Throughout 2011, despite similar type of volatility, certainly, the same type of issues we had to face, I do believe CEO behavior has changed much more this time than we've seen a year ago. I do believe CEOs have truncated their field of vision on top of all the truncated time horizons of investors.","The issue that I think is really critical is that 1.5% in treasury yields equates to negative returns. 1.5% over 10 years as a return will not get you to a retirement. I do believe, and I was in Washington yesterday, I do believe the greatest crisis in America will be not health care in the next 10 to 20 years but the inadequacy of retirement throughout this country. Yesterday, a very large pension plan, public pension plan announced that their one year fiscal year return was 1%. They paid out their actuarial tables as 7 5\/8%. Obviously, that type of mismatch cannot persist. As payout large numbers only destroys the corpus, creates a greater mismatch, and this crisis is only going to get worse if we don't find solutions to address it.","Compounding the impact of low interest rates is the fact that people are living longer and longevity is accelerating. While longer life should be a good thing, people are going to have to work much longer to reach their needs as a retiree. This, in turn, will create issues for our younger generation wanting to enter the workforce. There will simply be fewer jobs, and our younger generation will likely have an increasing financial burden funding the retirement needs of their parents and families. I believe that in the future, this underfunded pension and retirement plans will be more significant for governments in the United States and other parts of the world. We believe at BlackRock, we have the tools and the ability to combat these issues. We are working with our clients in trying to have them focus on that. We believe it's important to start focusing on returns over long periods of times, which requires focus on what type of long-term investing, not investing in products but in outcome-oriented solutions. So this is not the traditional style box. And this is a much longer conversation, and we are having these types of very long but very exhaustive types of conversations with our clients in trying to help them navigate with these difficult situations. So for the remainder of 2012, unfortunately, all eyes are still going to be on politics and the economy. In the United States, we have elections in November, followed by the impending fiscal cliff and the sequester. This will likely create additional uncertainty and lead to more soft business sentiment and probably a reduction in consumer spending. The global regulatory environment will continue to be more difficult towards financial institutions, forcing more deleveraging, creating more compliant requirements. But let's be clear. Asset managers will share an increasing cost of this regulation.","Europe will take, as I said earlier this year, anywhere between 5 to 8 years to sort out their issues. This is a long-term issue. There's no silver bullet. We are talking about transforming the social contract between government and their population. This cannot happen over a one-month, one-quarter, one-year situation. On top of that, the Europeans are going to have to find ways of growing in addition to these austerity plans. In the near term, as I said earlier this year, I expect the ECB to be more aggressive on rates to drive the euro close to parity with the dollar. This is one way that they could grow, find growth for Europe on top of these austerity programs by making them more competitive. This, on the other hand, is not a positive for the United States. If we have benefited, and our corporations certainly have benefited by having a weakening currency, and now our currency is becoming a more -- a valued currency, it will put some pressure on this country if the euro does indeed fall to a parity level. I think at this time, BlackRock assumes the euro is going to be falling to the $1.10, $1.15 area, but there are some people who believe it needs to fall lower.","Let me talk about this. What does this all mean for BlackRock? Let me first start off in talking about people. As a global organization and a leader of our industry, we are committed to adapting our organization to meet the needs of our clients in this changing environment. As our clients' needs change, we have to change, or we will be less important for our clients. Change, when it is prescribed, when it is planned, is both necessary and healthy for an organization. That includes change to ensure that how we are delivering our performance to our client, that is also in our architecture and how we have discussions with our clients. We recently witnessed some turnover in our portfolio management group with the departures of Bob Doll and Dan Rice. We actually wish both of them well. While we endeavor to keep turnover low to assure consistency in our portfolio management teams, there will always be some level of turnover. We certainly will make changes whenever necessary to avoid even the appearance of conflict of interest. We use change to enhance our performance whenever that is an issue. Another change we saw this quarter which I'd like to highlight is totally unrelated to the portfolio management changes, was my good friend and partner's, Sue Wagner's decision to retire. This does not change anything within BlackRock. We are actually fortunate with Sue agreeing to joining the BlackRock board in October, and I am sure we will benefit from her insight, her intelligence going forward as a member of BlackRock's Board of Directors.","Overall, our turnover at BlackRock remains to be very low, far lower than the rest of the industry. Our turnover rate at the MD level is under 1%. And turnover across the firm is also very low, approximately 4%, which is compared to an industry norm about 10% to 12%. BlackRock has always had a strong focus on talent development, including investing in our people, hiring top-tier talent with the ability to have immediate and a long-term impact on our company. As in the past, we are constantly attracting prudent leaders, who are excited to bring their deep expertise and client-centric philosophy to BlackRock. We highlighted Phil Hildebrand will be joining us October 1, formerly the head of the central bank in Switzerland, who will be taking a very important international role from our London office, working on solution-based relationships with our 100 most important clients. We noted earlier this year the hiring of Mark McCombe, who is now our Head of Asia Pacific and had a dramatic impact already on our business in Asia. We also have announced the hiring of many different investment teams, a number of investors in our fundamental equity team, where we were in need of upgrading due to performance issues. And we are very pleased with bringing onboard an entire emerging market debt team that will really enhance our position in global bonds and our positioning worldwide in the fixed income arena.","So we are a organization which many people are seeking to join this organization, and I think we are in a very unique position unlike so many other financial services companies. And we are going to continue to find opportunities to bring in very high-talented people, high-talented portfolio managers to help us build and navigate together. I'm also proud to highlight that our incoming analyst class this year is over 200. It's filled with some of the best and brightest minds from the top schools globally. Providing oversight of our talent agenda and succession plannings, we are fortunate to have an extremely strong and active board that was recently recognized as one of the top 5 boards for strong corporate governance. I believe we were ranked 1 when I saw the analysis. They are highly engaged in guiding the firm's strategy overall. On an annual basis, our board conducts a comprehensive review of each of our core businesses, including results, strategy, outlook, succession and talent planning. Recognizing the importance of our human capital, each year, management and the board reviews our top talent across the firm, and we have complete review of succession plans at all levels. That meeting will occur in October like it's done for the last 5 years. So this is nothing unusual, nothing strange. This is what we believe. We need to have a high fiduciary standard, and this is what we believe working with our board to making sure that we review management succession issues across all our businesses, not just one business or one leader. We believe this planning makes a better and more resilient organization and differentiated organization among so many different firms that have had issues around talent.","Let me talk about performance, which is the key to any investment management firm. We've had some notable performance in a wide variety of products supporting our key themes despite core global markets. We also recognize there are a few areas where we need to improve, and we are going to take action. I am pleased to say performance was strong across our fixed income, with our fundamental fixed income products demonstrating continued improvement and moving to the top quartile, with 71% and 81% of our active taxable fixed income AUM exceeding its benchmarks or peer median for the 1- and 3-year period. And particularly, our high-yield team, again, was very strong, with 80% of the AUM exceeding benchmark or peer median for a 3-year time period. And this was also were consistent with over 60% of the other assets benchmarked for a 1- and 3-year period of time.","I am pleased to say our performance in our alternative products have been quite strong in some of the cases, reversing some weaker performance that we saw in 2011. Our fund of funds of hedge funds, BAA, has now had 13, I want to underline, 13 consecutive quarters of positive performance relative to the benchmarks and peers.","Obsidian, our fixed income hedge fund, year-to-date is up over 20%, and it's clearly outperforming its benchmark and is now back to its high watermark or close to its high watermark going forward from last year.","FIGA, our model-based fixed income product, is up 7% year-to-date and outperforming its benchmarks. And I'm even more pleased to say after -- now it has 14 consecutive quarters of positive absolute performance, not just relative performance, absolute performance.","Our scientific active equity team, which as we were very public about 3 years ago, when it had some very poor 1- and 3-year performance numbers. Over the last few years, we've changed the leadership team. We've added many more portfolio members and also analysts to help us navigate this. And I'm pleased to say performance over its benchmark exceeds 67% for the 1-year and 85% for the 3-year. So we can now move from a defensive position, explaining what happened, to now going forward. We have the ability to focus on more positive opportunities for asset flow.","The area where we still are not hitting as well as we need to, and that is fundamental equity. This is where we've had some -- where we hired new portfolio managers. We will be announcing other hires in the most recent months to come. We have less than 50% of our AUM above the one year. It's approximately around 44%. That is not acceptable, and we are working towards building that platform up and making sure those issues are addressed.","We've also had a challenging year in parts of our multi-asset product area, Global Allocation, and it's a little under 50% in its benchmarks and its one-year period is actually in the 32% area right now. So we are working with that with Dennis Stattman, who's had a 10-year great track record. So Dennis, we have total confidence with he and his team, but these are the issues that we try to make sure that we stay on top of and address.","Let me move on to regulatory. This uncertain regulatory environment and recent bank missteps in financial services will undoubtedly be called for even more regulation, and asset managers may be impacted. This is a new reality, and BlackRock is trying to stay ahead of the curve and preparing for increased global regulation.","Let me just discuss money market funds. Being in Washington yesterday, I believe we are going to see the SEC finally come up for comment period a proposal. I don't know what the proposal is, but I think the gridlock within the SEC may be broken. I may be premature in talking about it, but that's the type of noise I heard in Washington.","We have been publicly acknowledged -- we have publicly acknowledged the need to further reduce the systemic risk in the money market funds without undermining the money market funds' source of value to investors and funding to the short-term capital markets. We have remained -- we have maintained a constructive posture with the SEC, with the FSOC staff throughout this debate.","SIFI designation. The Office of Financial Research is conducting a study of asset managers. We have encouraged them to try to be more transparent in their study. This study should be completed sometime in fall, and then there's going to be a likely comment period. So at this moment, I don't have any information what does that mean for BlackRock or any other nonbank organization that is being reviewed with the Office of Financial Research. So at this time, I can't give any more color on this, but we will learn the same time everyone else learns when the official proposal is introduced by the FSOC.","Now turning to the business, our focus on our strategic themes continues to be to drive flows across ETFs, retirement, income and multi-asset solutions. So let me give you some of the highlights. Institutional investors generally remain to be in a holding pattern while the trend for active to passive continues. Globally, our institutional businesses experienced about a $4 billion net long-term outflows. However, they were strong pockets of growth momentum, including defined contribution and in official institutions. Our strategic focus on retirement solutions continues to gain momentum as our DC clients generated $7.8 billion of net inflows, slightly tilted towards passive strategies. Our Life Path offering saw significant net flows of $3.1 billion. In alternatives, there was a lot of noise this quarter. We actually redetermined what should be an alternative product and what should be just a normalized active product, and $2.4 billion of that number was the redefinition of the product. It was not an outflow, but on the net difference, it looks like an outflow. There was also $1 billion of capital return because of successful reasons when we paid off a product. We are seeing outflows in global ascent which offset some of the great momentum we had in other products, including our multi-strategy hedge fund, our emerging market hedge fund, our model-based fixed income hedge fund, FIGA, and our renewable energy fund achieved for our first closing this quarter.","Internationally, flows were essentially flat as we witnessed again a mixed picture of clients' behavior. Obviously, in Europe, because of the situation in Europe, we've seen a real slowdown in client activity. Some clients are derisking their portfolios, worried about what this all means, and that's where we had an $8 billion active outflows, while others needed to add risk and we had $8 billion of passive inflows, largely index equities. So it really depends on the client, their situation, their liability. So there wasn't one dramatic trend. It was a mix of trends within Europe.","Let me just turn to a pipeline. We are very pleased with our net new business pipeline totaling approximately $55 billion as of July 12, up $30 billion from first quarter. This pipeline includes $9.3 billion of mandates that were funded since quarter end and $45 billion of awards to be funded. While this increase of our pipeline is certainly positive, I should remind everyone it is important to note that much of the unfunded pipeline is in passive, and then two, this only reflects, I would underscore, only reflects our institutional business. The majority of that number is institutional business. I think we are reflecting our ETF flows quarter-to-date. But that said, the underlying momentum in a number of areas across the firm is being masked by the environment that we're living with. We have strong momentum in alternatives right now, both in the U.S. and Europe, which is creating increased diversification across our alternative platform. Similarly, performance across our EMEA fixed income products is leading to good opportunities in EMEA retail and with our financial institution platform. And I'm very excited to tell you that these investments that we made over the last few years are beginning to pay off.","Let me move to retail, the U.S. institutional, then I'll move to iShares. Again, the industry flows were down significantly from the first quarter. Our retail franchise delivered strong results, with $1.6 billion in long-term net inflows globally, with particularly strength in U.S. fixed income. Again, most firms in mutual funds had outflows in the second quarter.","In the U.S., retail and high net worth generated $2.9 billion of long-term net inflows across all asset classes. And we continue to deepen our relationships in the SMA business, or the Separately Managed Accounts space, yielding strong results with $1.6 billion of net inflows, largely into municipals, U.S. core and other fixed income products. BlackRock is the largest and most recognized SMA platform in the country, with now $55 billion of AUM.","International retail, another example of risk-off in Europe. We had outflows of $1.3 billion, predominantly in equities, which is consistent across what we are seeing worldwide. Across our broad retail platform, though, we continue to innovate, we continue to bring new products to market. Internationally, we expect to capitalize in certain of our newer funds which are reaching their third anniversary with strong track records, principally our European credit fund and our high-yield funds in Europe. So once again, this rebirth, this renewal, this investment in investment teams, it doesn't happen overnight. We're getting assets, but you bring these teams in, you nurture them, they have good performance, and after 2 to 3 years, you start seeing inflows, and we expect that from those teams.","Global iShares. Despite muted activity industry-wide, iShares captured $6.1 billion in net inflows. We captured over 50% of the market share of industry fixed income flows for the quarter, with $11.7 billion in net inflows, while derisking, which is impacting even ETFs, is impacting the flows in our international equity and emerging market funds. I would say organizationally, we have 250 ETFs, and when you see risk-off globally, BlackRock's ETF platform or iShares platform will probably be more harmed in outflows because we have a multitude of products that are international-based that they are, I would call, more aggressive type of strategies than the core, what I would call, the core index, the core fundamental strategies. So that is one of our explanations in terms of market share issue. I could talk about that later.","This quarter, we started off strong because we did see some modest risk-on with $3.5 billion of net inflows so far this month, which is in line with our historical market share.","Consistent with our culture of innovation and strategy into new markets, we launched 50 new iShare products and special emphasis on fixed income and local equity strategies, including our Green ETF launched in Brazil, which generated over $200 million in flows during the quarter.","Let me move to BlackRock Solutions. BlackRock Solutions continues to be an industry leader. BlackRock Solutions continues to be in huge demand. The need for strong risk management and analytics made the second quarter a resilient quarter despite the market adversity. BlackRock Solutions revenues were up both for over-the-period-quarter and over a year-to-year basis. This is on top of a reduction of over $61 billion of Maiden Lane assets, so -- which I'll talk about in a second. So what is also important, we saw a 21% increase in growth in our Aladdin revenues, which now represents more than 2\/3 of our BRS revenues. Just 3 years ago, Aladdin represented about 1\/3 of the BRS revenues, and these are the long-dated, more sticky form of revenues as clients put Aladdin and other -- our Green package, our risk management tools onto their platform.","The Aladdin pipeline continues to be very strong, and increasingly, we are having -- our clients are now adopting not just our fixed income platform, Aladdin, but our clients are now looking to integrate our equity platforms. So we are working on Aladdin conversions now on the equity side for some of our existing fixed income clients. And I do believe having now a full product array of equities and fixed income at Aladdin is going to make Aladdin even more robust.","I just want to take a moment and say that because we're in a period of time that most positive is a negative and negative is a real negative in our atmosphere as of today, but there's one thing that I'm very proud of, and that is our successful payback of the asset disposition related to the Maiden Lane vehicles. People don't pause and think about this is money that the government gave to Bear Stearns to make the Bear Stearns merger work with JPMorgan and to stabilize AIG to a lot of negative press, a lot of uncertainty. The American taxpayers were paid back in full with interest, and there are still opportunities remaining for more profits with the remaining portfolio in these items. This is a pretty big success for our country, for our regulators in terms of what they are trying to attempt to do in stabilizing our economy back in 2008 and '09, and the results were very strong, and not enough success is being illuminated. We're spending more time focusing on failures.","Let me talk about brand. Our investment in our recently launched Investing for a New World campaign continues to deliver results. Building our strong brand is an extremely important long-term commitment that we are looking to make retail and our name recognition in the retail side to become a much stronger platform branded name. This is not just in the United States but globally. We now have clients who have never spoken to us before, calling us and finding more about our offerings. We now have more hits to our internal website than ever before, and we're having more conversations with more FAs than ever before.","Let me give a couple of final comments. In this climate, we're very proud of our platform. We are very proud of being a fiduciary, committed to always doing what is right for our clients' best interest. Once again, I'd like to really thank our employees for the continued discipline and diligence in serving our clients across the globe, and I want to extend my gratitude to all our clients who have trusted us with their financial future. With that, I'll open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just digging a little deeper into performance of active equity and fundamental equity in particular. Can you talk just a little bit about some of the people changes? And then should we expect that there's sort of a go-forward replacement cycle? Because if you look at, I guess, the organic growth rate in active equities, it actually improved sequentially. So should we think about some of the people changes maybe pressuring where you are with consultants in fundamental equity and just maybe address the performance of people changes there?","Laurence Douglas Fink","That's such a good question, I'm going to give it to Rob.","Robert Steven Kapito","We have continued to build investment teams that can weather the different cycles in the marketplace, and we're looking for teams to deliver a consistent long-term performance. And as you know, we spent a lot of time and money over the last few years investing in the right talent to build up the right teams needed to deliver performance. And you should expect that we are going to be very focused on this going forward, especially in areas where we see or feel that there has been underperformance. Let me give you a little bit of a broader answer to that beyond just fundamentals, and I'll touch on that. The first thing is that in our alternatives area, you see that we've expanded our product suite and addressing this with several new teams that are around infrastructure where we think a lot of investments will be made, private equity and real estate, and Ann Marie did cover a bit of that by announcing the addition of the new Swiss Re private equity team into our product suite. Larry mentioned a little bit about fixed income, where we are focused on the process to make sure our teams can deliver strong performance. He mentioned our fundamental fixed income products, which, we are very proud to say, have now moved back to top quartile performance, and the numbers are over 80% in active taxable fixed income, exceeding the benchmark. And then in iShares, continuing to innovate the product suite, where our index funds continue to deliver very strong results, over 95% are above their performance tolerance. And now finally, the equity area, which you highlight, we have brought in a brand-new emerging markets equity team to raise the bar. We hired a gentleman named Timothy Keith [ph] to head a new flexible equity team. We have Chris Leavy, who is a tremendous hire for us, who is focusing now on strengthening our performance in the Large Cap Series, in the fundamental large cap growth in energy and Global Opportunities products as well. So I can tell you that Larry and I are going to be less tolerant of performance that is not up to par with what we need to do to drive growth and raise assets. But when I look at performance, I also want to focus your attention on our focus areas and how this translates into areas of growth for our firm. So we have an income theme, and there, we have focused attention on our equity dividend product. It has not only had strong performance but is rated 5 stars by MorningStar and is the Lipper Leader for total return, and our global dividend income, which has produced really good income, and 85% of the holdings that they have, have increased their dividend. So here's an area where we have fundamental equity with good performance, and that translates into driving growth. Also, in the income area, investors are being served by the high-yield team that Larry cited, which is continuing to be in the top 14% of their peers and raising a significant amount of assets and driving because of the performance that they have. And I'll just mention a couple others. In alternatives, just to highlight a few that may not have been mentioned as well as it should have been, is our core appreciation composite, which is our alternatives flexible fund, hedge fund, has outperformed the target by a significant amount, and we continue to attract interest. And this global alpha product that we started in fixed income is up over 7% net of fees year-to-date. That's a very exciting product for us going forward. Within solutions, the one product Larry mentioned was the Global Allocation fund, and I would just say that this is a long-term team, and while the second quarter was a bit underwhelming, the absolute performance year-to-date is positive, and clients have focused on the good long-term performance and the ability of this team to generate a good alpha in very different environments. And lastly, in the retirement space, we created, as you know, the first target date fund, and 20 years later, we're very well positioned with our Life Path funds. They have outperformed on average 84% of their peers across all the vintages in 2011. And we also continue to see good flows in the ETFs and index product, with notable flows in the fixed income area. So I would say that performance can be described as very good in most areas. Turnaround, finally in a few areas that you've all focused on in the last few calls, but most especially, the strong performance in our 5 key focus areas and the continued investment in our portfolio teams are really driving the business at this point.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on the alternative bucket, just -- I mean, it looks like -- clearly, some of the core products experienced volatility. The volatility that you're seeing, is it sort of in line with what you've seen historically? And are we moving to a new -- to sort of a new place with alternative allocations, where maybe manager selection is mattering more? And then is volatility becoming more important? I don't know if that's for you, Larry or Rob.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Let me give it to Rob.","Robert Steven Kapito","It's really -- the only change has been the volatility in the risk on and risk off. We still rely upon the process that the individual managers have, which has really not changed, but I think that you may see more volatility in the numbers just because of this risk on\/risk off situation, which is happening globally. But I believe the long-term performance in those and the current process that we have will bear out the right performance numbers for the team moving forward.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you'd expect your flows to sort of follow that volatility pattern a bit more as well?","Robert Steven Kapito","Yes. And I think that the highlight that I mentioned, the FIGA, some of these products, which are the go-anywhere product, giving flexibility to the managers, is going to help their returns. And we already see that attracting flows, and also the clients that are interested, the amount of visits and interests are up on those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","On the alternatives, I mean, just thinking about the performance, the outlook, obviously, is very difficult to pinpoint or forecast. But can you give us a sense of how you think about performance fees today versus maybe this time a year ago or as we think about kind of even on a short-term basis next quarter and obviously, a big ramp potentially in the fourth quarter? But any guidance on how you're thinking about that outlook would be helpful.","Ann Marie Petach","Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, the volatility in the environment has made it difficult for me to pinpoint even my own internal forecast on performance fees because we've seen -- as I've been observing, where some of the biggest funds are relative to high watermarks, I see them above high watermarks one week, and the next week, below them. And it's so much a single point in time measurement that that's what makes the forecasting hard. Rob had the luxury of talking over time, and I fully agree, the performance over time is going to be strong. And I know the question you're asking is the performance on a single day, and that becomes challenged. Of course, last year also was not our most robust year ever in performance fees. And year-to-date, we've tracked broadly in line with last year. But that being said, this environment does make our...","Laurence Douglas Fink","But I would say things like Obsidian is now back to close to its high watermark is an opportunity now going forward. And we have other products that are doing quite well, like FIGA and R3 or BAA. So I think because of the volatility, it's hard to track actually what the amount of performance fees, but I would say we are in a better position at this moment than we were last year in terms of where we are in terms of high watermarks and other issues. So it's now up to the PMs to perform, but we're in a pretty good position. But the volatility is pretty extraordinary.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. But that's helpful. And then I guess on the expenses, Ann Marie, you mentioned that there was a 14% increase in marketing within the broader kind of G&A line. I guess could you help us understand what kind of the dollar amount that is and maybe as we think about expenses going forward, how much -- where you are in that spending kind of marketing campaign and think about maybe the ramp, or is that a good run rate kind of thinking about the rest...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Let me just say one thing before Ann Marie discusses the specific here. Obviously, all our spend is a function of what our commitment to everybody is related to our margins. Not one expense is looked at separately from a total view of how you're tracking in our margins. Our margins are up about 0.5%. I think depending obviously where beta, I can give you a much better degree of where our margins will be. But I know -- one should not just lock in a spend on anything hard just because we are going to mitigate spend as we think about margins, as we think about going into 2013. But that said, we are very committed in this brand campaign. It is a long-term strategy and a major component of where we believe this firm needs to go. So that, Ann Marie will give you more of the -- can give you much more of the, I guess, the granularity of that.","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. So just to give you the specifics, sequentially, marketing expense was up a little more than $20 million. I would say that would be a reasonable rate at which we could run, but there will be some seasonality in our marketing. So you're not going to see -- like Larry said, we're going to spend it the way it makes sense. When everyone's in vacation in July and August, we're not going to be running the same amount of ads. We're going to spend less money, and you're going to see that come down. In the fourth quarter, when people are ready to invest, you're going to see it come up. So we're going to spend -- I think the important thing is we're going to spend the money in a way we think we're going to get a real return on it.","Laurence Douglas Fink","And versus the overall level of where the firm is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a question on the composition of the institutional pipeline. Can you talk about what was the largest mandate in the pipeline?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, it's multibillion. It's less than $10 billion. I think -- my guess is $6 billion or $7 billion. I mean, I think about $6 billion to $8 billion. It's in that range. I know the client, but I don't remember the exact dollar amount. And I must say these are not in the pipeline. I met with a client last week and we're looking at a portfolio -- I'm not here to tell you we're going to win it, but we're working on a strategic relationship with a client that is -- it's over $15 billion. We're working on other clients that are looking to outsource a large component. This is something that Rob's working on that may be possibly outsourcing a large component of the balance sheet. So we're not even close to winning these yet, so I don't want to put these in any models or businesses. But we are -- because of this uncertain environment, clients are looking for more, as I said earlier, more thoughtful, more strategic type of conversations, and some of the conversations we're having are really robust. But I think on a general basis, Craig, our pipeline makeup is really consistent with the past types of pipeline compositions.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a follow-up on the new trading platform initiative. I was wondering if you could give us any update and also talk about -- is all the expense for this platform kind of really in the run rate today? And then also maybe talk about what's the opportunity to revenue from the trading effort in your solutions business.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, a, I learn about a lot of it from the press. They seem to know more than I do. So we did do a beta testing, which the press actually got, and we're not trying to hide from it. It was very successful. I'm not even going to talk about how many clients were on it, but it was successful. We all seem pleased about it. The run rate is probably appropriate with whatever is in our platform already, but if we start seeing it ramped up, we will have a higher run rate once we start really implementing, if we have tens and tens and tens of clients as part of it after we go from the beta testing. And then when you look at -- in terms of revenues, we haven't focused on the revenue model component of it yet because we're focused and making sure the functionality. And if the functionality is good, if we can show to clients that this is a better execution, the clients are aware that ultimately, this is going to be some form of a revenue model. Let me be very clear, though. As BlackRock as a participant, for our clients that we are navigating trades for our clients, we are charging no commission. So that has to be very clear. We cannot do that. That would be illegal. It would be against a lot of the Rissel [ph] laws and all the other things. So we are doing that flat and clear with the idea that we're a higher fiduciary and we're getting better execution. For clients who are on the Aladdin platform, there would be, obviously, a transaction cost fee. It could be cost plus something, which would be very de minimis. So I look at this not unlike when we first created Aladdin, when we all started offering risk management service for our clients. It was really meant to be a cost -- ability for us to fray some of our technology cost. Obviously, it transformed into something way beyond that. We are looking at this as if we could earn enough revenues to offset all our trading platform costs across BlackRock, that's a huge win. It helps our margins. So I don't want anyone to model out something that's going to be a massive transformational revenue area because I don't expect it'll ever be that, but it may. I never would have expected BlackRock Solutions' Aladdin to be as strong and robust as it is so -- but we are looking at it primarily to raise the bar as a fiduciary standard to minimize execution cost for our clients. And Craig, as I said to everybody over the last few years, we would not be upset if the market-makers of today make the most tightest market ever and that there's not a need for our trading platform. We are doing this only because of the issues surrounding Basel III, Volcker Rule, all the other issues, where we believe there's going to be less capital in the marketplace for the security firms to be making markets for. And so as a result of it, we believe there will be a long-term need for this type of platform to reduce our cost of execution.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kelley of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So just taking what you said about -- and we see it too in the asset liability gap of some of your clients and how that's widened out versus your pipeline and where you're seeing new flows, what do you think stems the disconnect here? When do institutional clients take on more risk? What is needed to get them over the hump?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, let me just tell you a funny story I had. This is not an institutional client -- let me restate. This is not a pension fund client. I was having dinner with one of the large sovereign wealth funds, which clearly is multigenerational tools for capital, and all our conversations over dinner were about talking about long-dated solutions. And by dessert, though, they said, \"But we are still measured quarterly.\" That's the dilemma. And that's the dilemma that everyone's facing. We are -- clients are frightened of short-term volatility, and so they have derisked. And as you cited and what we have said in the past, derisking is actually causing much greater pain over a longer period of time that -- and importantly, if you are -- even if you are an individual retiree, one of our defined contribution client, if they're 35 years old and they've been sitting in bonds for 5 years during the era where you're supposed to start ramping up the compounding of your return to get an adequate retirement, you were really harmed. And I don't believe in our country today, in other countries, we do enough to focus on how does one get to the nest egg that is necessary to live comfortably during the retirement ages. We spend so much time focusing on health care. We spend so much time focusing on how to live an extra day, week, month or year, and yet we spend so little time focusing on how can we build the appropriate nest egg to have that life during retirement. I think in the short run, what we have seen, we talked about this over quarters and quarters, we're seeing more barbelling. We're seeing clients barbelling, going into beta products and then going into alts. Some of it, unfortunately, is not -- they're going into alts. Why? Because of accounting. Because in some, like in some private equity areas of beta, the accounting is longer-dated, and therefore, they have less volatility. And so I hope those are fewer and fewer clients who are doing alts only for accounting reasons. Obviously, another reason why clients are going into alts and barbelling is because they're looking more for absolute return strategies not relative to return strategy, and they're absolutely looking for return strategies that meet -- that exceed at least 7 5\/8% return. So they can meet their liabilities. So I would say what we are seeing now -- I mentioned this $15 billion client. This client is worried about low interest rates and how it's impairing, and they have given us this ability to relook and recreate what they should do with this $15 billion. And we're going to be looking at it over a multi-period of time. And so what I do believe clients are beginning to do, they're asking the question how should we frame this out? We're actually spending more time talking to the boards of some of the pension plan, trying to help the board understand this. Their fiduciary responsibility for retirees and for current employees is a very difficult one. So these are very hard questions to answer. And if we continue to have low rates and if some of these plans only earn 1%, these issues become even more enlarged. So I really do believe our platform has proven to be a differentiator in these conversations. So not only do we have the breadth of products, but we have the risk management tools that help them think about it. And this is what gives me a great amount of comfort about what we're doing and how we're positioned.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one follow-up from me on the opposite end of your barbell strategy then, there's been a lot of talk lately about your iShares strategy and the low-cost competitors gaining share. So just curious where you think for your business specifically you'll see the most growth going forward both by asset class and by product -- sorry, by region, not by asset class.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, as I said earlier, when there's a risk-on in the world with our breadth of products that are worldwide, we will have more than our market share. As I said in the beginning of the third quarter, we've had more of our industry type of market share because there was a little risk-on in the first week or so of July. But when we are head to head in a commodity-based product, I think you're correct in saying when a commodity-based product at one of the core strategies where price becomes more dominant because competitors have equal liquidity, equal tracking air, price is a more dominant issue. Without going into much detail, we believe we have a plan to address it over the next coming months. And it is a big issue. I have to give a lot of credit for Vanguard. They are a trustworthy brand, and they've taken market share from BlackRock in the U.S. core type of equity products. We're holding our own. Obviously, worldwide, we're holding our own in fixed income, but I am not pleased in our positioning to date in the core commoditized products in the United States.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just on the fee rate, usually in the second quarter, there's the sec lending fees, so it's a little tough to try to measure. But if we just look sequentially, it's an unusual quarter because your average core AUM x advisory, the assets would be up a little over 1%. But if you look at the fee rate, it's down, and if you strip out the incremental sec lending fees, it would be down a decent amount. So I was just wondering, you mentioned some of the weight on, like, international equity markets. But if you look at it on an average basis, they weren't down as much. And so I guess I'm just trying to figure out, did you really see a lot of, like, core fee rate pressure, or when we just take the period-end AUM numbers given the value of the market in June, it's just a bad kind of average AUM number.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Mike, I think the number one issue is a mix of business. We saw flows out of equity, flows into fixed income, different margins. So on top of the beta -- out of some active strategies and the beta strategies, the key -- and this is an industry issue, much more outflows in equity globally and much more inflows in fixed income. The risk-off trade.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. That's helpful.","Ann Marie Petach","No, I was going to say there are no fee issues. It's all \u2026","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, we had no fee issues. That's what I'm...","Ann Marie Petach","But even within equity, it's a mix issue going from what I would call the higher-risk areas to the more core areas, and those tend to be higher fee to lower fee. So it's all mixed...","Laurence Douglas Fink","But also if you look at where markets degraded the most, those are some of the higher fee areas, the emerging market products, the energy products, that's where the greatest degradation of actual returns were, where we had these larger negative returns, and those are the higher-fee products.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. Okay, that makes sense. And then maybe just on the succession that you mentioned just in terms of the overall firm. Yes, it's really the most asset managers that the firms tend to be run for the investors, and that's where a lot of the focus is on. And so from the investor's side, we don't see the full bench. So with Sue retiring, what's your outlook -- who's on the bench? I mean, obviously, Rob, but like what's -- how do you kind of see BlackRock going forward over the next couple of years?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, Sue was visible, working alongside with me, but the bench actually has increased over the last few years. We have a robust executive committee of men and women, part of it. As you said, Rob is the President, actively working on the firm's issues every day, alongside Charlie Hallac, who's our Chief Operating Officer and has been the Chief Operating Officer for 2 years. We have Rich Kushel. We have -- our bench is actually growing, not decreasing, and adding the Mark McCombes and the Phil Hildebrands has enlarged our bench. And we have some young men and women in our firm who are really taking on much more of the responsibility. You're going to hear more and more as investors about Rob Goldstein. He is the individual who runs BlackRock Solutions. He's done a fabulous job. He's been at the firm 20-ish, 18 years to be exact. And he's done an incredible job. And so the bench is growing. And I'm forgetting some of the names or I'm not mentioning all the names. But I would tell you the bench is strong. It's robust. And I'm very proud of the process in which we are engaged in elevating our team and making sure we have a robust team. Rob, do you have any comments on that?","Robert Steven Kapito","No, I think the board goes through succession planning, and we have just done an exhaustive review that's going to be presented. And that's part of our goal is to make sure that we are bringing up individuals, giving them more responsibility and having a very broad bench. And we're -- we'll continue to do that. And I think the focus has been on several people that have left the firm. Unfortunately, no one is talking about all the people that we've recently brought into the firm. And we'll continue to do that and raise the bar for talent. I agree with Larry. We have a very strong bench that's been built over many, many years.","Laurence Douglas Fink","But we've heard the investors ask for more transparency with -- having more visibility with more of our team, and we're planning to do that. And in fact, we have thought about doing investor days at BlackRock. I think we are planning to do that later this year or next year.","Ann Marie Petach","June.","Laurence Douglas Fink","June of next year.","Ann Marie Petach","June of next year.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Okay. So I was -- so that's already on the schedule. So we have much more transparency and visibility with our leaders of the firm.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Question on the -- I appreciate that you're highlighting the kind of different revenue characteristics of the different asset mix, iShares and whatnot. But maybe be helpful also to -- if you can provide some incremental color on the margin variance. I mean, my general sense is maybe iShares and index, even though clearly, lower fee realization rates may actually be higher margins, I mean, if there's any kind of color you can provide on how we should think of the variance and probably...","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm going to have Ann Marie to really get into it. But once again, I would say twofold. A, the mix really does have a strong impact on the margin. You're absolutely correct. The margin specifically in index and ETFs are higher. But obviously, the equities have a higher margin than fixed income. And so you take into the mix, you take into -- as I said, where do you have the greatest market declines, those are the highest fee type of products. And I think it's just -- it's heavily into the mix, but Ann Marie, help me.","Ann Marie Petach","I think the margin, you're absolutely right with the ETFs and index, both being -- because there's low incremental cost with managing those assets. You can put on a lot of volume. It's the beauty of that part of the business model.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And Larry, understanding that we really don't know what the FSOC will come up with, whether it relates to naming you or others a SIFI and what that even means from a capital perspective or otherwise, but how is kind of that uncertainty playing into your thoughts over the next coming quarters or year about capital management? Is it kind of at the margin making you a little -- your appetite for, say, share repurchase a little less robust? I mean, how should we kind of think about it?","Laurence Douglas Fink","There's no question that it's an element of our process of thinking. It's not a major element. I think if it was an element, I would not have bought $1 billion of shares back in May. We intend to continue our share repurchase. In our conversation with our board, we believe that will be an essential component. I think you should consider share repurchase as a continuation. We believe that with our huge free cash flow, that is just going to be a continuation of our business model. So we don't -- once again, I don't believe we're going to do any large-scale acquisitions. However, we are going to -- we continue to see small fill-ins, whether it was the Claymore transaction in ETFs or what we did in the fund of funds, which really fulfilled our needs because we have a very strong U.S. fund of funds of private equity. The Swiss Re transaction makes it a global fund of funds of private equity platform, and it actually enlarges our products and infrastructure also. We are actually looking at a couple of fill-ins right now, one exclusively, and we hope that is something that makes sense once we do some due diligence. So we are in the market of making sure we have the best platform and taking advantage and being opportunistic in terms of fill-ins, as I suggested, as part of our business strategy. But I will make it very clear. Utilization of our free cash flow for share repurchases and dividends is also a major component of our plans for the future. Whether we are a SIFI or not, as you said, we don't know what that means for capital. We already have approximately, what, $1.2 billion of capital set aside because of regulators' request as a result of the BGI transaction. So we, unlike most asset managers, we already have capital set aside. We are -- and another thing, you're aware of it, but I need to remind everyone, we're already regulated by the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FSAs, the SECs. And so I'm not sure how that translates if we are one and what does that mean. It probably will have bigger impact if there are other firms who are not regulated by these entities who will have a more pronounced impact than it would on us. And possibly, and I'm not saying it's going to happen, there's a possibility that if you're designated a SIFI, it might be a good thing. Maybe you are because you're so properly reviewed and scrutinized, you have a higher fiduciary standard and people -- investors want that. The mood is changing dramatically. It was always suggested for banks who are designated SIFIs, and I think this is going to be true, that their liability costs are going to be less because they're going to have more associated capital. And I do believe in efficient markets their liability costs should be less than other firms. Now since we don't have those types of capital needs and debt, it doesn't have that type of impact, but we'll see. We'll see how this all plays out. What I can say is we are trying to be as constructive and helpful when asked by regulators on helping them what it means to be an asset manager. We have spent time educating them on asset managers. So we've had requests from regulators, can we educate them? Obviously, one component of Dodd-Frank, I have to remind everybody, we are not allowed to have conversations to the regulators about this or it becomes a public disclosure item. This is very different than most other forms of regulation or potential regulation. And so let me be clear about it. We are not going to regulators and trying to lobby or try to go against it. We are trying to be cooperative when asked, and so that's why we are still in the dark somewhat about how this all plays out.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just wanted to come back to the ETF business and the equity side, in particular. Obviously, we saw the outflows, and you gave some good color, and obviously, emerging markets and other business also, you guys were a little bit weak, so I hear that. But just the idea that we had outflows and in general, I'm wondering if that means anything to you in terms of the maturity of the business, not just your iShares business but equity and ETFs as a whole. Do you think the access to passage is slowing down or is it just really a risk on\/risk off kind of a move we're seeing here?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I've asked my team that specific question because obviously, that would have a meaningful impact on the future. So we believe it is entirely a risk-on\/risk-off type of transaction. As I said, we've had $3.5 billion of inflows so far in July. Those are more of the non-core type of ETF. They're more in what I would call the risk-on type of products. And so more than ever before, I think if you think about it, what area has done some of the worst performances are areas like emerging markets. It is Europe and it is energy product, it is mining, some of the ETFs that were very big winners a year ago. And one thing I think is very important to note, as I suggested in other quarterly calls, we see very large, active institutional participation in ETFs when they are searching for equity exposures, whether it's in Europe or emerging markets. So you have to also think this is not outflows from retail. It was more of the institutional managers worldwide who use ETFs for beta exposures. They are -- they took off risk, and so it's just a -- to me, using this flow information is a great indicator of mood. And when -- I don't believe it is an indicator of a transition into a new pattern of growth. I think it's a real indicator of mood, which is consistent what we are seeing across our other products.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then I guess just lastly, switching to the active side, I think you mentioned a little bit about the quants, the scientific equity product, and how you finally have the better performance. But I feel like you've talked about the better performance already for a couple of quarters now. So what is changing now that you think you have a better conversation with clients to actually turn this into inflows?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Inflow products?","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","Laurence Douglas Fink","We are having better conversations. Those conversations have not transformed yet into flows, but we are having better conversation or actually having some clients who had us on watch list before who have now taken us off watch list. And one client actually gave us more money. Now that was one example. It is -- so as you know, this area had severe underperformance 3, 4, 5 years ago, and now we've proven that over the 3 years, we actually have consistent performance, a couple hundred basis points over most indexes. And it's just time, but the conversations are more robust. The conversations are better. And I would just say the outflows in that area are the lowest levels that we've seen in the past 6 quarters. So it's -- the conversations are more frequent. I could tell you the consultant conversations are totally changed from one that \"What's going on?\" to \"Tell us more.\" And so it's just time. I wish I could tell you time is today. I don't have that understanding yet, but generally, we see -- after 3 year anniversaries, you begin to see a slow and modest uptick, and then you start seeing some real flows.","Alex Kramm - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. Very, very good. I guess it's something to look forward to.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, and I am looking forward to it, too.","Thank you, everyone. Thank you, all the employees. I look forward to talking to everybody with a report at the end of the third quarter with a risk-on mood. But we'll see. Have a good quarter, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3570":["BlackRock, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade.","All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that, during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris. And good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our financial performance and business results.","While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.","The third quarter was once again marked by significant market volatility associated with ongoing global trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty around the world. While US equities finished the quarter up 1%, emerging market equities ended the quarter down 5% and the US dollar continued to appreciate against the euro and pound.","As we have seen in previous periods of market volatility, industry flows slowed in the quarter and clients continued to rebalance and derisk favoring fixed income and cash over equities. ","Even within equities, investors demonstrated caution, shifting from momentum to value and favoring high dividend and low volatility funds.","BlackRock's business model, however, continues to work as well as it ever has. Over the last 12 months, we have generated approximately $350 billion or 5% total organic growth. ","Our fully integrated One BlackRock business model was purposely built to bring together the entire firm to meet client needs in today's evolving ecosystem. Our globally diverse investment and technology platform, including our risk management and portfolio construction tools, is positioned to deliver not simply products, but comprehensive solutions to clients no matter the market environment.","We remain focused on thoughtfully investing in our business for the long-term and capturing growth in areas of highest client demand. These include iShares, especially higher growth and higher fee segments like factors, fixed income, sustainable, and megatrend ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology where we continue to evolve Aladdin's multi-asset analytics and portfolio construction capabilities.","These investments will position BlackRock to continue delivering higher and more consistent organic revenue growth across market cycles.","BlackRock generated $84 billion in total net inflows in the third quarter or 5% annualized organic asset growth, driven by continued momentum from our industry-leading fixed income and cash businesses.","Total annualized organic base fee growth of 3% reflected this mix shift toward lower fee products, but was also impacted by volatility driven outflows from higher fee market-driven iShares ETFs in August.","In particular, EEM, our flagship emerging markets ETF, saw $6 billion of outflows during the quarter.","Third quarter revenue of $3.7 billion increased 3% year-over-year and operating income of $1.5 billion rose by 7%. Earnings per share of $7.15 were down 5% compared to a year ago, however , as higher operating income and a lower diluted share count were offset by lower non-operating results and a higher effective tax rate in the current quarter.","Non-operating results reflected $7 million of net investment loss, primarily driven by the mark-to-market valuation of our minority stake in Envestnet. Recall that non-operating results in the year ago reflected a $40 million gain attributable to the disposition of our equity interest in DSP.","Non-operating results versus a year ago also reflected additional interest expense associated with BlackRock's mid-April debt issuance to partially finance the eFront acquisition.","Our as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 23% compared to 16% a year ago, which reflected $90 million of discrete benefits. We estimate 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2019, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation.","Third quarter base fees of $3 billion were up 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth, the positive impact of market beta and acquisitions, partially offset by the negative impacts of foreign exchange and strategic pricing investments and lower securities lending revenue.","Dollar appreciation over the last year had a negative 1% impact on our year-over-year base fee growth, while lower cash spreads led to a 6% year-over-year decline in securities lending revenue.","As previously mentioned, BlackRock's differentiated platform has generated total organic asset growth of almost $350 billion over the last 12 months. But divergent beta and mix change, items that we can't control, continue to impact our absolute level of base fee growth as compared to growth in average AUM.","While the S&P 500 was up 4% on average year-over-year, the BlackRock revenue weighted equity index was actually down 1% as markets linked to our higher fee equity products in Europe, Asia-Pacific, the emerging markets, and natural resources were flat to down 8%. ","In addition, in the recent market environment, clients' preferences has favored lower risk assets and approximately 85% to our organic growth over the last year has been in fixed income and cash, which have relatively lower fees compared to other asset classes.","While base fees were up 3% sequentially, as a result of higher average AUM and the effect of one additional day in the quarter, on an equivalent day count basis, our overall fee rate declined 0.4 basis points versus the second quarter, reflecting this ongoing impact of mix shift and divergent beta.","Performance fees of $121 million decreased $30 million year-over-year, reflecting lower fees from alternative and long-only equity products. Sequentially, performance fees increase as a result of a single European hedge fund that locks annually in the third quarter and once again delivered strong performance over the last 12 months.","Quarterly, technology services revenue increased 30% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. ","Demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and digital distribution tools.","Total expense was up 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense and expense linked to the eFront acquisition, offset by lower G&A and direct fund expense. ","G&A expense was down $29 million from a year ago, primarily due to lower transaction related and foreign-exchange remeasurement expense, partially offset by higher technology expense in the current quarter. Sequentially, G&A expense was down $86 million, primarily due to $59 million of product launch costs incurred in the second quarter and lower contingent consideration fair value adjustments and foreign-exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter.","Consistent with prior years, our fourth-quarter G&A spend will be seasonally higher than the first three quarters of the year. At present, after adjusting for the acquisition of eFront, we anticipate that our full-year core G&A spend will be generally in line with the full-year guidance we provided in January.","As a reminder, core G&A expense excludes the impact of product launch costs, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, foreign-exchange remeasurement expense and transaction-related fees.","Direct fund expense was down 4% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, despite higher average AUM due to a benefit recognized in the current quarter. We would expect direct fund expense to return to a more normalized level in the fourth quarter.","Intangible amortization expense was up $15 million year-over-year, reflecting a full quarter of intangible asset amortization related to the eFront acquisition.","Our third quarter as adjusted operating margin of 46% was up 180 basis points from a year ago, reflecting significantly lower levels of non-core G&A expense in the current quarter.","Ongoing market volatility is contributing to increased beta divergence and client preference for fixed income and cash, leading to a more challenging industrywide revenue capture environment.","However, BlackRock's differentiated business model, financial position, and strategic alignment with high growth opportunities allows us to continue investing responsibly for the long-term.","Our capital management strategy is specifically designed to support this Invest First ideology and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.","During the first quarter, we completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, repurchasing $1.6 billion worth of common shares and stated that we would be opportunistic with respect to repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of the year.","In line with that commitment, we repurchased an additional $100 million worth of common shares during the third quarter, taking advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities that arose during August's market volatility.Quarterly net inflows of $84 billion benefitted from continued strong demand for iShares, alternatives, fixed income and cash, reflecting BlackRock's unique ability to meet client needs in a variety of market environments.","iShares ETFs are unique in having a broadly diversified set of products that serve both long-term buy-and-hold wealth investors and institutional asset owners, as well as tactically-oriented institutional investors who value secondary market liquidity and the vibrant options ecosystem.","iShares net inflows of $42 billion, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, reflected continued momentum in fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs, each a market segment that has strong long-term growth potential and a higher fee relative to BlackRock's total fee rate.","Quarterly fixed income ETF flows of $24 billion was driven by clients' ongoing adoption of these products as a critical component of their portfolios.","Factor and sustainable ETFs generated $13 billion of quarterly flows as investor demand for these exposures, especially in the US and Europe, increased in the current environment.","BlackRock is the industry leader in all three of these fast-growing categories.","Retail net inflows of $7 billion reflected broad-based strength in active fixed income, partially offset by outflows from multi-asset world allocation products.","BlackRock's US wealth advisory franchise continues to gain share and has seen year-to-date organic growth of 8% in alpha funds and SMAs, while the industry as a whole remains flat.","Institutional and retail demand for alternatives continued, with $3.5 billion of net inflows into illiquid and liquid alternative strategies in the third quarter, driven by real estate, private credit, infrastructure and event-driven hedge funds.","In addition, we have approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.","BlackRock's institutional franchise generated approximately $4 billion of net inflows in the quarter. Positive institutional index flows, driven by continued strength in LDI, more than offset approximately $4 billion of institutional active outflows in the quarter which were primarily due to several client-specific active fixed-income redemptions.","Net inflows into higher fee quantitative active equities and alternative strategies resulted in overall positive institutional organic base fee growth for the quarter.","Finally, BlackRock's cash management platform saw $32 billion of net inflows, a post-financial crisis record and crossed the $500 billion AUM threshold as we continue to leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions through cash matrix and Aladdin.","Cash is a strategic asset class and BlackRock's diverse cash management offering, including prime, ESG, government and munis, position us well to serve our clients' cash needs and continue to grow our market share.","In summary, our third quarter results once again demonstrate the resilience of our globally diversified investment and technology platform to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments.","Our focus remains on delivering the solutions our clients need to achieve their long-term investment objectives. We can't control market volatility or the impact it may have on our revenue capture quarter to quarter, but we can ensure that we meet the needs of our clients by generating exceptional risk-adjusted performance across all of our investment products.","We continue to leverage our competitive positioning and the stability of our financial model to invest responsibly in high-growth areas such as ETFs, alternatives and technology that are critically important to clients and shareholders alike.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink ","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. More than ever before, clients are looking for asset manager partners who understand their whole portfolio and investment goals. They want partners who can provide insight in the context of a complex and changing investment landscape. And rather than just sell products, they're looking for asset managers who can deliver solutions that meet their financial objectives.","In the third quarter, a number of macroeconomic and geopolitical events drove global market volatility and heightened investor uncertainty. BlackRock's differentiated model continues to generate strong results. ","By always looking ahead to recognizing unmet client needs, we have positioned BlackRock with the diversity, scale and global full portfolio perspective to help our clients navigate their investments in all market environments.","As Gary mentioned, we generated $84 billion of total net inflows, showing strength in many areas across the combined active and indexed platforms. We increased revenues by 3% and operating income by 7% year-over-year.","During the third quarter, geopolitics were once again a primary driver of markets, impacting investor sentiment. Global market index sold off, had a tumultuous August as the US treasury yield curve inverted and trade tensions escalated.","However, markets reversed course in September. And following a significant rotation out of momentum stocks and into value that had been building over the last year, US markets achieved their greatest year-to-date gains in more than two decades and averaged 3% higher sequentially in the third quarter.","Meanwhile, even with a partial recovery in September, emerging market indexes averaged 3% lower for the quarter, a 6% divergence in these markets.","Fixed income, the low and negative interest rate environment persists. In an effort to extend the economic expansion, we're seeing unprecedented synchronized signs of intervention by central banks globally.","For the first time since the financial market, the Fed announced that they would add liquidity into the system after a brief spike in short-term repo rates signaled liquidity constraints, or maybe supply issues.","Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB announced they would restart their asset purchase program to support their inflation targets.","The simultaneous rise in historical safe assets alongside riskier equities in the third quarter highlights investors' uncertainty about the global economy, the state of trade negotiations and the Federal Reserve's path of monitoring easing.","In this unprecedented environment and faster than any time since the financial crisis, clients are transforming what they demand from asset managers. They demand transparency, value, convenience, higher returns and better outcomes. They want a global perspective, an insight, from partners they trust.","BlackRock is uniquely positioned to meet those client needs. Our combination of active, index, factors, cash and alternatives, powered by our industry-leading portfolio construction and risk management technology, enables us to take a whole portfolio approach and is resonating with clients more than ever before.","The value of our differentiating model we have built is increasing as we make the most of BlackRock's capabilities, from the asset management to risk analytics to ESG solutions through partnerships and strategic advice.","One recent example of how we bring the best of BlackRock together for clients is our strategic partnership with Rabobank in the Netherlands. We are providing an innovative solution consisting of a custom set of funds that combine technology, data and investment and risk management tools through Aladdin that benefits the needs of Rabobank's clients for transparency and value.","We also recently published our eighth global insurance report which includes BlackRock's analysis of key findings from our survey of 360 insurance companies in 25 countries, representing more than $16 trillion in assets. ","Insurers are increasingly focused on building portfolio resilience through diversification and better portfolio construction. They want to optimize fixed income, integrate private markets and increase sustainable investing, themes which we see more broadly across our client base.","BlackRock has the insights, the technology, the whole portfolio context to help our insurance clients understand practical actions that they could take to address their needs, and we have the breadth in solutions that they are seeking.","Our ability to be a valued partner is the direct result of the investments we have made to stay ahead of our clients' needs and innovative across our platform. Our innovations across illiquid alternatives, fixed income ETFs, factors. sustainable investments, cash and much more are driving our inflows. ","Clients have entrusted us to manage $350 billion of new assets over the last 12 months alone, representing 5% organic growth rates. And as clients re-risk out of cash into fixed income, BlackRock will participate and benefit by virtue of our solution-based approach.","We have even more opportunity for BlackRock going forward and continue to invest in the highest growth areas for the future \u2013 iShares, illiquid alternatives and technology. ","In iShares, we've doubled our asses from $1 trillion five years ago to more than $2 trillion today. We believe the ETF industry itself can double over the next five years and we're investing to support the growth of the industry and maintain BlackRock's leadership.","The movement by independent financial advisors and direct platforms in the US to eliminate transaction costs is increasing accessibility to investing for more and more people and we believe will accelerate ETF adoption.","The elimination of barriers to investing is a good thing. It democratizes access and enables more people to save, invest and reach their long-term financial objectives.","With the commission free moves, we now have access to more clients than ever before and we remain confident that iShare value proposition will continue to drive growth and BlackRock iShares market leadership.","iShares generated $42 billion of net inflows in the quarter, led by strong growth in fixed income, factors, core and European ETFs. We once again captured the number one market share in ETF flows globally, in Europe in the high-growth categories including fixed income, factors, sustainable ETFs.","iShares is not just one, but rather several product segments \u2013 core, fixed income, factors, sustainable, megatrends and precision ETFs, each with a range of different ways that different clients are using them.","For these segments, fixed income, factors, sustainable and megatrends, represent more than $600 billion of AUM today and have generated more than 20% annual organic asset growth on average over the last five years and have a higher average fee rate than BlackRock's overall business.","Demand remains exceptionally strong for fixed-income ETFs where iShares is the market leader. We captured $24 billion of net inflows in the quarter and a record $87 billion already year-to-date as client demand for fixed-income exposures accelerated, including from other asset managers.","Growth is coming from the adoption of ETFs as replacement for individual bonds and individual sources of liquidity and transparency during times of market stress.","Fixed-income ETFs have also been utilized by more and more fixed income investors for active purposes, using ETFs as a mechanism to get active returns. We are also increasingly seeing clients adapt shorter duration fixed-income ETFs as a substitute for cash in their portfolios. And now with commission free, this proposition is even stronger for cash substitutes. Fixed income ETFs are a technology that is accelerating and will definitely modernize the global bond market.","We are the industry leader in factors and our factor iShares have more than tripled in assets over the last five years from $44 billion to $161 billion in AUM today, including over a 25% annual organic growth rate on average.","Year-to-date, we captured the number one share of factor flows, surpassing nine ETF factor players as well. We see increased adoption in model portfolios and from RIAs as wealth clients look for a high-value factor exposure that support resilience and defensive positioning in their portfolios.","Demand is also coming from European clients looking for greater value than traditional active and better returns than traditional indexes.","Sustainable ETFs are a strategic segment that while relatively small today at $40 billion in industry AUM we believe can grow to $400 billion over the next decade as more clients look for strategies that target a measurable ESG impact in financial returns.","iShares sustainable ETFs represent $16 billion in assets, up from $1 billion five years ago. We have generated more inflows in sustainable ETFs than any other manager this year and have four out of the industry's five largest sustainable ETFs.","Client demand for sustainable investment solutions extends way beyond our iShares business. ","Shifts in demographic and investment conviction are driving increased interest in sustainable investing globally and these forces are likely to accelerate.","BlackRock is committed to providing clients with choice across the investment spectrum that aligns with their investment goals.","We currently manage over $65 billion in dedicated sustainable investment funds, an additional $500 billion of accounts that apply exclusionary screens. We are integrating ESG data, ESG tools, ESG research insights to support our investment teams in every asset class, so all teams, active and passive, can incorporate material ESG data into their process with the idea of enhancing risk-adjusted returns.","I've spoken in the past about using technology to drive more BlackRock's revenues. Technology is a priority and a strategic differentiator for BlackRock. In addition to generating direct technology revenues, we're increasingly using technology to enhance our results in our asset management business.","For example, we're transforming our cash management business by integrating technology into our business model. We are delivering cash matrix technology to help clients streamline their operations and quickly and efficiently make more informed decisions.","Five years ago, cash management was $281 billion business. Through technology, organic growth and acquisition, we crossed $500 billion in AUM July. This represents over a 200 basis point global market share increase from five years ago and is an important milestone as scale is a key value proposition for clients in the asset class. Increasingly more and more BlackRock holistic client relations are starting through a cash management assignment.","Illiquid alternatives is another area where we're innovating to scale our business, expand our platform and integrate technology into a business model and momentum is increasing. ","Including net inflows and commitments, we raised over $5 billion in illiquid alternatives in the third quarter, led by real assets in private credit. ","We have raised a total of $46 billion in the last three years and nearly doubled our illiquid alternative platform to $92 billion in AUM and dry powder today. Demand for private markets remain strong as clients seek longer duration, higher returns and eFront further strengthens our illiquid alternatives and will support growth over time.","Our direct technology service revenues grew 30% year-over-year as more clients are looking for holistic and flexible technology solutions to operate their businesses more effectively and more efficiently.","For institutions, Aladdin is an enterprise investment and risk management systems that power the entire investment process on one single platform.","What truly differentiates BlackRock is its user\/provider business model, its ability to provide integrated, multi-asset capabilities throughout the entire investment process, from sophisticated portfolio analytics and construction to trade execution to compliance and to investment operations. ","The combination of eFront with Aladdin further reinforces Aladdin's value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world. ","Aladdin is also a powerful solution for customers and custodians who service their assets through Aladdin providers, as well for wealth managers who need to offer transparency and convenience to their own clients through Aladdin Wealth.","We now have 13 clients using Aladdin Wealth and expect to further growth to come from our expansion into different wealth segments and markets around the world. Aladdin is increasingly the language of portfolio construction for wealth managers. ","Understanding and managing risk is critical to helping clients achieve the financial outcomes consistent with the intended objectives and risk preferences.","We're also seeing more and more clients use Aladdin Wealth as a business enabler, to grow their business in a differentiated way in the markets, using it to have client-centric, portfolio-based conversations that enhance their dialogue with their clients.","We're strong momentum going forward as industry consolidation, shifting product usage and regulations are increasing the need for a more holistic and flexible, technology-driven solution at both institutions and wealth managers.","BlackRock is well positioned to capitalize on these trends and is committed to enhancing our technology capabilities to continue to meet our clients' needs and their future needs.","In a world where the merits of globalization are being challenged by so many, BlackRock has and will continue to be a global company. We have a global footprint with employees in over 30 countries, with clients in more than 100 countries. And we are making a global impact, working to improve issues such as retirement in every country where we operate. ","This focus on using our expertise in high-growth regions around the world positions BlackRock to both drive increased flows and fulfill BlackRock's purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being.","We recently crossed the 20th anniversary of BlackRock's IPO. On October 1, 1999, BlackRock listed on the New York Stock Exchange for $14 a share. Today, we're trading around $434 per share, representing a 19% compounded annual growth rate for our shareholders.","As market changes and as our clients expect more from us, we stay true to the innovative instincts that has defined BlackRock and enabled the strong results we are seeing today. ","We at BlackRock will continue to evolve, we will continue to innovate, we will continue to stay in front of our clients to meet our clients' needs, while reinforcing our key strategic differentiators.","Our global scale and reach, a culture centered on client needs, a global voice heard around the world and a One BlackRock approach to delivering for clients.","With that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey. Good morning, Larry. I wanted to get your perspective on how the commission cuts over the last two weeks at the e-brokers will impact both distribution and also the overall competitive dynamics on these US e-broker platforms. And also, any impact as we think about either flows or the underlying economics still?","Laurence Fink","I'm going to let Rob Kapito answer that question, but if you could see my face, I'm smiling at the opportunities.","Robert Kapito","So, Craig, the commission-free trends have been very positive for iShares. And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, the elimination of barriers to investing simply means that more and more investors are going to have the ability to use ETFs. And as the ETF market leader, this has got to be good for BlackRock. More clients than ever before have access to the value and quality of iShares funds to hopefully achieve their investment goals.","So, commission-free trading is actually accelerating ETF flows in the two fastest growing US wealth channels. One is the US RIA and that represents a $5 trillion market that has grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate. The other area is the US direct investors, and they represent $7.5 trillion in market that has grown at a 10% compound annual growth rate.","So, our share on the e-broker platform has expanded since the commission-free trends began, and these segments are becoming a larger growth engine for BlackRock overall. ","So, we're confident this will increase the number of investors using iShares as an essential part of their portfolios, and with our focus on quality exposures at very good value, we think that we will continue to lead the industry.","As you know, global iShares generated $42 billion of net inflows, representing 8% annualized organic asset growth, and these flows were driven by growth in fixed income, core, factor, and sustainable ETFs.","So, just to reiterate, because this is important, fixed income ETFs are a technology, and they're accelerating the modernization of bond markets and had a very good quarter with $24 billion of net inflows led by treasuries, mortgage-backed and high-yield corporate bond funds. We are also seeing clients increasingly adapting shorter duration fixed income ETFs as a substitute for cash in their portfolios.","On the factor ETFs, we saw $9 billion of net inflows as investors sought resilience in their portfolios and defensive positioning; for example, in our min vol factor ETF. ","The sustainable ETFs saw $4 billion of net inflows as we see increasing client demand for achieving sustainable outcomes alongside financial returns. And as Larry mentioned, iShares captured the number one market share of global, European, core, fixed income, factor, and sustainable ETF flows in the third quarter.","So, this is just another way that we think is going to increase interest and demand for ETFs for our investors.","Laurence Fink","I'd just add one more thing. Rob said it and I said I think in my prepared talk. Having commission free for low duration makes ETFs a great alternative to bank deposits, a really good solution towards money market funds. And so, a commission free in the fixed-income realm \u2013 cash and fixed income is a real opener for so many more participants.","Operator","Your question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Alex.","Alexander Blostein","Hey, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Just building on the last question, so commission-free ETF trading accelerating growth into ETFs makes total sense. I was hoping that you guys could comment on some of the economics that could come out of this. In particular, I was curious how the payment and potential savings really from reinvestments maybe of some of the payments that you guys are currently making to some of the platforms could come through, whether or not that's a margin improvement dynamic for BlackRock or is that an area of additional spending for other platforms or lower management fees on some of the ETFs? So, maybe you could help us kind of flesh out the economics a little bit better. Thanks.","Laurence Fink","So, let me just say one thing. Our relationship with Fidelity, as I kind of alluded to it, is as strong as ever. Our relationship is way beyond ETFs. It's about education. It's about working with their platform. And so, our relationship with Fidelity is unchanged, if that's what you're trying to allude to, related to what we pay them and other things. We have a great relation with Fidelity. We have great opportunities looking forward with them too. And I'll let Rob \u2013 go ahead.","Robert Kapito","And we have other distribution agreements. They're not impacted by this. It really just simply gives us more access, and since we are already a very known commodity to these distribution groups, this really only enhances it, and it really is not impacting the fees that we are charging on our ETFs . This is a way for our clients to get in commission free to trade, which is very important as clients have moved more away from individual stock-picking to a portfolio construction and are using ETFs as a major tool in that portfolio construction. So, getting into it is where they're saving the money. It's not really impacting our fees. Maybe Gary wants to add to that.","Gary Shedlin","I think you guys both got it. I don't think there's any question this is a great outcome for well-branded, scaled ETF providers. And we're going to continue to prosecute our strategy as we ever have. But I don't see that there's any impact on our pricing structure as it relates to ETFs from this move.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Good morning, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Good morning, Larry. Just given the strength in alternative flows this quarter, I wanted to get your view on the outlook and how you're positioned to grow, given rising allocations in the private markets. Maybe some of the near-term challenges we're seeing with private companies looking to go public.","Laurence Fink","Well, I think on one segment, private companies are having problems. And that's more growth-oriented, technology companies that are having problems going public. I don't see the overall market is in much trouble.","But related to BlackRock and alternatives, as we said for a number of years now, alternatives is a strategic priority for BlackRock. We're now up to $126 billion in liquid and illiquid strategies. We manage now $71 billion of illiquid AUM across infrastructure, real estate, private credit and now LTPC. We raised $5 billion the last quarter between commitments and wins. And we raised over the last three years $46 billion, doubling our AUM in the category.","I also believe, and this is one of the fundamental reasons why we think technology connects and helps us in flows, our acquisition in eFront, obviously, it's going to make the Aladdin system even more robust which I talked about, but eFront also gives us a greater ability to penetrate in terms of illiquid alternative sales. And so, we truly believe there is a deeper connection between what we're doing in technology and then the illiquid alternatives.","And this is consistent with all our \u2013 with the entire BlackRock platform. We have consistently differentiated ourselves in the fixed-income universe for now 30-odd years by having risk technology. After the BGI transaction, we added all of the sleeves of technology for equities and that became a bigger component of what we're doing. And now, through the eFront acquisition. It really does help us having a unique perspective and a unique ability to integrate what we're trying to do in terms of illiquid alternatives.","So, you're correct in saying, we're seeing more and more utilization of alternatives as an asset category. We know many clients are moving from 10% to 12%. Some clients are moving to 12% to 18% in terms of allocation. But there are also areas within the illiquid area that, in some markets, the valuations are fully priced too. And so, I don't think it's a perfect scenario.","The area we believe and where we have a unique emphasis on \u2013 where I believe, over the next 5 to 10 years, we're going to see an expansion, that will be in the infrastructure side. We believe infrastructure is going to be a bigger and bigger component of both public and private, like we did in Abu Dhabi, but we see many, many opportunities like we did in Mexico a few years back. So, we believe that there's going to be \u2013 firstly, there's great client demand for the product and the key is finding the strong supply. And I do believe more and more entities, more and more players are looking to do this.","I would also just say, we are one of the leaders in renewable energy. The cost now to put up solar fields, it produces electricity at or cheaper than natural gas. As a leader in renewable energy, this is going to be a major component of our future. Part of our flows was in a renewable energy fund. We just raised another big block. We're about to close the final raise of that fund.","So, overall, it's a major component of how we're evolving our organization and we're very excited about the dialogues we're having with more clients.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Bill.","William Katz","Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the questions. So, maybe a two-part question if I could. I guess, the first part of it is, as you think about your spending outlook into the new year, you highlighted three different areas \u2013 alternatives, technology and passive \u2013 where are you in the respective growth cycles as you sort of think about year-on-year increase? ","And then, secondly, Gary, you mentioned that you step into the stock in August when you thought about relative value. Can you sort of clarify, when you say relative value, how are you thinking about that, what would be the multiples to the group to the market? I'm sort of curious of your \u2013 at present to which you're seeing that opportunity.","Laurence Fink","Sure, Bill. So, in terms of your spending question, was it a question as we're thinking about the New Year, is that how you're thinking about it?","Christopher Meade","He can't answer that.","Gary Shedlin","Okay. Well, I'll just assume it's a question. So, yeah. I think \u2013 look, we're, obviously, very mindful that we're in a market environment that makes predicting beta or counting on beta in a lower return world, given where volatility is, getting where divergent beta is, where fixed income markets are more complicated. So, we are obviously more aware than ever that we need to basically continue to invest in our major engines of growth. We highlighted alternatives. We highlighted technology. We highlighted ETFs. There's obviously much more beyond that, but those are the three that are incredibly critical priorities for the year and we are going to seek to get as much investment dollars into those businesses as we can going forward, which means, given our commitment to continue to be margin aware that we're going to reallocate as aggressively as we can to make sure that we are being mindful of both margin and long-term value creation for our shareholders. ","In terms of the second question, which was \u2013 what was the second part of the question? Oh, the capital return. Thank you. In terms of capital return, I think you mentioned a number of them. We look at value relative to our peers. We look at value relative to the market overall. We look at value relative to what we believe our growth prospects are and we're constantly trying to basically see where we think it makes sense just given some of the \u2013 the market goes down and sell asset manager mentality comes from, where were we think there's some of valuation opportunities that make sense for our shareholders going forward. So, we look at all three investments. Absolutely relative.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Mike.","Michael Cyprys","Hey. Good morning. Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on low and negative rates. With rates so low and going lower across the world and negative rates in some parts, I guess as we look out over the next couple of years, how do you see that impacting the asset management industry just in terms of how you're managing the business, how you structure portfolios, the impact this could have to fees and asset allocations as well. ","And just maybe a second part related to the asset allocation, we've seen a lot of flows into fixed income, but with rates so low, at what point do you see an influx of flows into equities, just given return rates are so low? What's the catalyst for equity inflows?","Laurence Fink","Let me just start off. We built the model of BlackRock really to be able to work with our clients in risk-on, risk-off environments, low vol, high vol, and the key is working on their long-term solutions. And all the ins and outs of markets, let's be clear, it's on the margin for most investors. It's not big giant changes. They may reallocate 4%, 5%, 6% of their portfolio and navigate around that. At the same time, much of the flows, maybe they're outsourcing more and more of their portfolio. They may be looking for \u2013 they may be consolidating managers. ","But I'd say the most important thing that \u2013 how we've designed the organization is to make sure that we have the diversity in the platform, so we could be the best we can as a solution provider to our clients.","The other thing that we're try to drive is making sure that not one asset class drives our business. ","And so, in answering your question about low or negative interest rates, it appears they're going to be with us longer than I think we all expected at the beginning of the year. And with that, I think client trends have been to move still to de-risking until they have some sign as to where they should navigate. ","At the same time, clients on the margin are still as a de-risk in some categories. They're looking to put some of that money to work in higher risk or less liquid strategies like illiquid alternatives to try to get as much return as they possibly can.","As I said in an earlier conversation that there are some areas that look rich to us already in the private area, but there are a lot of opportunities in other areas.","I don't see persistence in low rates being a major cause for clients looking for lower fees. In fact, 2019, I would not qualify as a year of massive fee pressure. But when clients are looking to do big, giant restructurings or are looking to do major reallocation out of many managers into one manager, they're certainly looking for fee reductions if you're able to have a majority of those assets. So, you offer that type of scale and it doesn't really impact our margins as much. ","But I don't know that it really matters for us where are clients going, when do they pivot back into equities. We're not seeing any indication at the moment that clients are asking more and more questions about when do they jump back in. As I said, I think we get \u2013 clients are heavily in equities now. What we see every quarter is marginal changes in their portfolio allocation. It's not dramatic changes. ","Rob, did you want to add\u2026?","Robert Kapito","Yeah, I was going to say, and dovetailing a report that you did, Michael, that we read that was very good, our survey shows something very similar that clients are not adding into their equity portfolios. They're using that portion to go into alternatives. And it's getting back to the original barbell trade where they're using short-term fixed income, so that they're keeping the risk the same and then allocating more to alternatives.","Actually, I think this is a benefit for us for two reasons. One, in portfolio construction, they need to use the cheapest products and we are offering the passive and the ETFs which are growing in that way. Two, we are also offering the alternatives. But, three, more importantly, is sourcing assets. And it's become very difficult for clients to source assets by themselves and, therefore, they're putting out more money for people that can actually find these particular assets, which dovetails into what Larry is saying, into new asset classes being real assets like infrastructure and others which they would have a very difficult time sourcing themselves.","So, it's actually fitting in to the strategy that we have, both having the passive and lower-priced product and now offering the higher-priced source assets, whether it be private credit which you saw grew dramatically last quarter here and the real asset and other alternatives which we agree with you are going to continue to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Davitt","Hey. Good morning, guys. Could you dig in a bit more on the client-specific institutional bond outflows against what still looks like pretty robust flows broadly? And through that lens, are you still seeing a big institutional mandate pipeline, I guess, outsourcing the bond management capability like we talked about last quarter?","Gary Shedlin","Sure, Patrick. It's Gary. So, again, if you think about some of the trends that we've had, we've talked about during the year, I think we've seen broad-based strong performance and flows in our active fixed income business. That's come from a combination of some of the market environment that we've talked about, but also really strong performance across the platform, candidly. If you recall last quarter, we called out a number of very significant large, strategic client wins and we actually had about $65 billion of positive flows in the second quarter. This quarter, we had a couple of clients that went the other way and we had, I think, in the average [ph] about $7 billion of outflows in the quarter. Again, I would call those more client-specific, lumpy redemptions.","But it's hard to look at this in any three-month period of time. I think, more broadly, you need to look at the longer-term trend. And on a trailing 12-month basis, we're running right now at about $55 billion of active fixed income inflows, which is representative of about 7% organic asset growth rate.","So, I think we will have timing issues, but the clear trend here is very positive in terms of the strategic positioning of this business.","Operator","Your final question comes from Kent Worthington with JP Morgan. You may ask your question.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth Worthington","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. One follow-up on the earlier questions on e-brokerage. Do you think the move to zero commissions in e-brokerage might impact pricing in the wealth management industry more broadly, either in full service brokerage or advisory where pricing seems to have been pretty resilient thus far? And if so, are there opportunities for BlackRock to adjust its approach to distribution in the wealth management industry? You highlighted cash ETFs and e-brokerage, are there similar examples sort of for change in wealth management? Thank you.","Laurence Fink","There's no question, the resiliency of the overall fees for wealth management is pretty inelastic so far. We're starting to see some of the e-brokers charge much lower fees than the traditional wealth management platforms in terms of the overall advisory fee. But, unquestionably, when commissions are free, the investor is going to have to make a choice. Is the value proposition of having that advice worthwhile versus having a commission to your relationship? And every client is going to have to make that assertion. ","But I do believe, just like we've seen in ETFs, we see now in e-brokerage, there is more and more fee pressure across different segments of financial services. Quite frankly, through technology, distribution is a better connection too.","So, I believe where we are going to benefit, with the evolution of what's going on in wealth, though, is models and portfolio construction. And I do believe a portion of that is going to be factors and ESG. I think those will be the added products like we said how cash and short-term duration bonds will be lifted by that. But we also believe the utilization of models and portfolio constructions is going to be a major component of that value proposition for advice.","And through that advice, we are absolutely confident that factors and ESG will play a larger role and it will accelerate adaption of those products.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","I'd just like to thank all of you for joining this morning and for your great questions and your continued interest in BlackRock.","Our third quarter results are directly linked to our deliberate investments we made over time, but, more importantly, our results speak loudly about the deep partnerships we're making globally with our clients.","I said it time and time again, clients are looking for solutions. They're not looking for an asset manager who's talking about a product. Clients are looking for asset managers who are helping them with their purpose, not the asset manager's purpose. The client is looking for organizations that can help them in risk-off periods, in periods of risk-on. And I believe if you look at our $350 billion of flows over the last 12 months, our model is working. And we are continuing to be excited about the opportunities we have for BlackRock in the future.","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. First Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Mallow, General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks, let me point out that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements. And as you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, let's let the call begin.","Ann Marie Petach","Okay, thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Just a very brief comment, a number of our shareholders, clients and employees are in Boston, so our thoughts are with all of you in Boston.","But moving on to BlackRock, I'm happy to say that Gary Shedlin is joining us for today's call and will be assuming the CFO title and responsibilities after this quarter's 10-Q. I'm also pleased to be turning over the reins at a time when the business is doing well and when there is terrific momentum with our clients, our performance and markets. Gary has been a key adviser to the firm and, given his knowledge of the firm and the industry, has stepped in running. I'll provide some opening comments, point out a few highlights in the earnings supplement. And as usual, we'll be discussing primarily as-adjusted results.","As I said on our January call, we began 2013 with great momentum. That has continued and is reflected in the first quarter results. We generated first quarter EPS of $3.65. That's up 16% compared to 2012, reflecting a 12% increase in operating income and a 9% increase in revenue compared to a year ago.","The first quarter operating margin was 40%. That's up 1.4 points from a year ago, and this is our strongest first quarter margin since the acquisition of MLIM. We are demonstrating the leverage in the business while investing for top line growth and also investing to assure compliance with evolving regulatory requirement.","These results are especially strong when you consider that the first quarter included $18 million of fund launch costs and $33 million of costs associated with about a 3% reduction in staff. The staff change is associated with an initiative to align our organization to present priorities and opportunities. We're hiring to support growth and expect to end the year with meaningfully more people than we began the year, though, of course, it does take time to make sure we're bringing in the right talent. To be clear, this was not a cost-savings exercise. It is an action to align talent and capability to what we believe are the most important opportunities for our clients. As the environment, needs and opportunities change, we will continue to change, evolve and innovate.","Most importantly, first quarter earnings reflected organic revenue growth and positive momentum in net new business, as well as the benefits of strong performance. The themes for which we positioned ourselves last year continue to play out. Investors are seeking income and in the present low interest rate environment, are using lower volatility, higher-yielding equity investments to achieve these objectives. Investors are also using rotation across equity beta segments to produce alpha. Once again, index products, that's both ETFs and institutional, are the go-to tools for investors to achieve their objectives. Multi-asset class and income products continued to appeal to clients' needs for solutions, and barbelling strategies are driving flows into single-strategy hedge fund.","Our capital policy remains consistent. The foundation of our strong dividend is supplemented by our ability and intention to repurchase shares consistently. We repurchased approximately $250 million worth of shares in the quarter. Our core quarterly repurchases have increased over the last 5 quarters as the secondary sales of our 2 large shareholders are now behind us. The strong cash generation of our business allows us to continue to invest in both organic opportunities and tactical accretive acquisitions. In the current environment, we expect to continue regularly with this repurchase activity.","I'm going to move to the earnings supplement, which you can find on our website. I'm going to skip a number of slides and focus on just 6 slides that tell most of the story. I'm going to start out on Slide 8.","As I mentioned previously, we produced a 16% increase in earnings per share compared to first quarter of 2012, driven by 17% growth in operating EPS, which I'll come back to in a minute. Nonoperating results reflected a $51 million increase in the market value of our co- and seed investment that was driven largely by positive marks on our co-investments both in private equity and distressed credit products.","The first quarter as-adjusted tax rate was 31%. This is a little lower than I had estimated on the last call but is a rate that we now think is a good planning level for 2013 that's based on what we know as of today. The improvement from the prior estimate was driven largely by our geographic mix of earnings.","Moving to Slide 10, first quarter revenues were $2.4 billion. That's up $200 million or 9% from a year ago and really about 3 quarters of that came from improvements in base fees. Exceptionally strong performance on a number of our single-strategy hedge funds contributed to our strongest first quarter performance fees since 2006. And I'd point out, 2006 was a bit of an anomaly because it was just a single real estate fund driving this, where this is solid performance across a number of hedge funds.","The third and fourth quarters remain our peak performance measurement periods, and the second quarter has historically been our lowest quarter. We'll continue to update you on performance throughout the year.","We delivered 11% growth in core Aladdin revenues, offset partially by a decline in the advisory revenues associated with the successfully managed wind-down in the Maiden Lane portfolio. The appetite for Aladdin remains strong. We had 5 successful implementations in the quarter. And Larry is going to talk more about our robust pipeline here and the ongoing client appetite for these tools and services. It is clear that our clients and the opportunities are increasingly diverse, including insurance companies, pension funds and other asset managers.","Base fees, as seen on Slide 11, were up $152 million or 8% with growth across almost every asset class. In the first quarter, we generated about a 5% annualized organic growth in long dated assets, and that's both if you look at it including and excluding the lower fee institutional index assets. The strong flows in equity ETFs and retail really means that the organic revenue growth was well in excess of the AUM growth. The flows reflect a terrific response from our clients to the focus areas which we discussed earlier.","We also entered 2012 with the benefit of our -- 2013 with the benefit of our 2012 flows and 2012 market improvements, both of which were positive contributors to the first quarter 9% revenue growth. We are not surprised by the year-over-year decline in active equity revenues. We are committed to improving performance in this area, and this is something we've been talking about. We made investments in new teams and talent in 2012, and we do have some great areas of success in European equities and the performance now on our quant equities. While we're not satisfied with the present results, particularly on U.S. equities, we are very confident in these new teams and pleased with some of their early successes. It's just going to take some time.","Excluding fund launch costs -- and now moving on to expenses on Page 12 -- and also excluding the reorg costs, expenses were up $53 million or 4%. That 4% is compared to the 9% increase in revenue, again, reflecting leverage in the business. The expenses that went up were primarily driven by revenue-related compensation. The first quarter comp-to-revenue ratio was 36.5%. This is broadly in line with a year ago. The first quarter ratio for comps revenue generally runs higher than the full year. This is due to the seasonality of payroll taxes. And this year, also due to the reorg expenses, which affected the first quarter ratio.","I'll talk a little more about expenses when I talk about sequential results. Broadly speaking, the majority of the themes we have discussed are playing out in our sequential results in a similar manner as in the year-over-year results but there are a couple of unique items I want to call to your attention.","Beginning with revenues on Slide 16, and as we've already discussed, we're seeing the benefits of both flows and markets contributing to base fee growth. At the same time, we see the natural decline in performance fees associated with the seasonality of blocks. The small decline in BRS revenues was associated with the timing of recognition of revenues on those onetime advisory-type assignments in the fourth quarter of 2012 and not at all reflective of the momentum in the business or opportunity.","With respect to expenses, on Slide 18, the $56 million decrease in G&A, that's excluding fund launch costs, was driven primarily, really, the big bulk, by the timing of our marketing spend. As I said last quarter, we will continue to invest in our brand. We've seen positive client reaction to the campaigns. We work very carefully to really spend the money when we think we've got important messages for our clients and when we think it will have the most meaningful impact. Thus, it may not be consistent from quarter-to-quarter but in aggregate, should remain broadly consistent with the full year 2012 spend. With respect to compensation, I've already mentioned the seasonality of payroll taxes.","So to summarize. The first quarter, in many ways, is a continuation of the trends and results we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012. We delivered organic revenue growth driven by our strategic focus areas. We delivered performance, which drove performance fees. We delivered year-over-year margin improvement, and we continued to return cash to shareholders. Our success has been driven by our commitment to consistently run the business to serve our clients and deliver value to our shareholders.","With that, I'm happy to be stepping into a role where I'm going to have a lot more time with our clients.","Again, I think the timing of this transition is ideal given BlackRock's positioning relative to client needs and our ability and commitment to innovate and grow. I know that among Gary's priorities is to continue to raise the bar on the quality and depth of our conversation with our shareholders and analysts.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry, who will talk a lot more about what we're seeing with our clients, our continued investment in talent and some of the trends of accomplishments that we're excited and proud about.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. I just want to pause again and talk about the incident in Boston yesterday. We are constantly reminded as investors of global markets that we live in uncertain times. The terrorist acts in Boston deteriorate confidence for investors, which is one of the major causes of problems related to our financial markets. But at this time, we should just all pause, and our prayers and wishes go out to the families of -- who are harmed and those who even witnessed this tragedy. It's just another reminder of the type of world we live in and it's a reminder as investors of -- in global markets that we have to be always cautious related to our outlooks because we live in these uncertain times.","As Ann Marie covered in her report, we delivered strong first quarter financial results, including a 9% revenue growth, 16% EPS growth and a 40% operating margin. Importantly, we generated another quarter of consistent organic growth. Long-term AUM grew 5% on an annualized basis while base fees grew at an even higher rate, highlighting the positive mix shift that continues in our business towards our retail and iShares channels, which are having higher revenue profiles.","During the quarter, we continued to reach new corporate milestones. We're at the highest AUM ever, $3.936 trillion, including record AUM levels in each of our client channels. We delivered record first quarter revenues and operating income. iShares crossed over $800 billion of AUM this quarter.","We saw our strongest quarter for equities net flows at nearly $34 billion. And we saw exceptionally strong Aladdin growth in the quarter, where we added 7 new Aladdin clients. And we've added close to $1.3 trillion of new assets being implemented on Aladdin.","This was a very strong quarter for BlackRock. And looking back, following our 25th anniversary as a firm, these results clearly demonstrate the tremendous value we've built, including our unique mix of capabilities, scale and global reach. Yet it is the next 25 years and the enormous potential in front of us that excite me. Last week, we completed our leadership off-site, where our focus is squarely on growth, growth through innovation and growth through focused execution. I believe we have the strongest management team in the industry focused on delivering unique client solutions. Couple that with our growing brand recognition and global presence, I can assure you we continue to see a long path for growth in the future.","We've talked about in past calls the diversity of our platform, which has allowed us to capture flows across market cycles, and this quarter is no different. I just want to step back and say this is a platform that is unique in its scale, in its breadth, in the balance between passive and active, and it is because of that platform, we're able to achieve these type of results.","We witnessed cash coming off the sidelines and being put to work largely in equities and multi-asset products. And while I don't believe this means we're seeing a great rotation out of fixed income -- in fact, we saw a strong growth in fixed income in different regions of the world -- we're witnessing investors searching for yield in a variety of asset classes including equities and higher-yielding fixed income. Investors want fixed income that look like equities and equities that look like fixed income. Even as investors move back into equities, they are cautious, emphasizing low volatility and emphasizing income. This trend will likely to continue for the foreseeable future for at least 2 reasons. Global demographics are evolving, and aging global populations continue to grow. We are living longer.","As I mentioned before, longevity and the lack of preparedness for longer retirement is a significant global issue. And this issue is going to be with us for years to come. Global quantitative easing programs have reduced rates to its historic lows. Long-dated fixed income securities traditionally used to fund retirement obligations now carry asymmetric risk for investors looking to match retirement assets and liabilities. So for the foreseeable future, investors will be forced to find yield in other asset classes such as equities, alternatives and higher alpha fixed income.","Let's jump into some details on the business and then open it up for questions. In global retail, we generated $8.8 billion in new flows, our strongest quarter in over 2 years. Our key themes continue to drive positive momentum across geographies, led by income, outcome-oriented solutions and alternatives.","Investors are continuing to look for a variety of products to satisfy their needs for income in the current low-yield environment, and so -- and to do so in a way that protects them from this asymmetry in interest rates. Our SIO, strategic income opportunity, product and actively managed fixed income fund, designed to perform well in diverse interest rate environments, took in more than $1 billion in the quarter and crossed the $5 billion threshold.","In the U.S., we launched a multi-sector fixed income closed-end fund generating more than $700 million in new assets. This fund will grow to over $1 billion once leverage is added.","Internationally, we saw strong flows in our Euro Short Duration, our high-yield and global opportunity bond funds demonstrated the continued evolution and diversification of our global platform. On the Solutions fronts, we saw investor appetite for absolute return products, particularly in Asia and in Japan. We met this demand by raising over $1 billion in our Global Allocation product.","Retail alternative strategies had a strong quarter globally with the strength of our 40 Act [ph] products in the U.S. and in single-strategy hedge funds in Europe. In the U.S., we saw flows of more than $700 million, driven by global long\/short credit and emerging market long\/short equity. The alternative mutual funds we've launched in the past 2 years are now over $1.5 billion in AUM. And we recently launched 3 new funds in this space to capitalize on growing demand for our expertise in this category. This will increasingly be an important theme in our global retail franchise.","Fundamental equities is a mixed story in the quarter. We saw flow -- outflows in our U.S. franchise, and this not a surprise as we changed 4 of our investment teams over the last few quarters. We saw positive equity inflows into EMEA close to a $1 billion, led by our strong European equity product as investors added incremental risk. With nearly $5 billion in flows in the United States and nearly $4 billion internationally, I continue to be excited about the diversity of flows and the continued global potential of our global retail.","Global iShares led the market with $25.6 billion in net inflows, representing more than 1\/3 of the first quarter's industry flows, approximately 35%, driven primarily by strength in equity products. iShares continue to be a barometer for risk appetite as clients increase their equity exposure. Early in the quarter, we maintained a leadership position in global equity flows with broadly diversified net equity inflows of $26.3 billion.","IShares' first quarter flows were diversified across regional businesses. U.S. iShares showed strong equity inflows of $20.4 billion, which was slightly offset by a fixed income outflows of $3.2 billion. Also, our Core Series product suite, which we launched last year to penetrate the buy-and-hold segment, gathered more than $3 billion in net inflows during the quarter.","International iShares new business was driven by equities inflows of $5.9 billion and in fixed income inflows of $2.2 billion. We saw particularly strength in our single-country funds such as Mexico, where investors are using these vehicles to put money to work in local markets without having to build the infrastructure to support the individual security purchases.","We remain totally committed to growing and innovating our iShares capabilities, both organically and through acquisitions or a few partnerships. We will continue to be aggressive in evaluating transactions that provide unique capabilities for accessing new markets.","Last month, we announced the long-term exclusive alliance with Fidelity that enables Fidelity's 10 million customers to access ETFs, with a smaller marketing -- to access ETFs provided by iShares. We started this relationship 3 years ago with a smaller marketing arrangement. And this is the next step in a longer-term relationship that aims to meet the needs of self-directed investors on a major scale. Fidelity was already an important relationship for BlackRock, and I'm very excited about working with them in the years to come.","Our global institutional business produced $5.1 billion in long-term net new business driven largely by a combination of continued shifts to passive and demand for multi-asset class solutions. Institutional flows were led by passive equity net inflows of $13.6 billion. As we talked about in past calls, more and more institutions have shifted to passive as part of a barbell strategy for tactical allocation as part of a core holding. And we see these trends continuing, particularly for passive equity where we saw our largest flows in more than 2 years.","We saw outflows in our institutional active business, primarily in the United States. While a portion of the outflows in our active equity franchise was due to the weak historical performance, the preponderance of outflow activity in fixed income was episodic events such as M&A activities and clients reallocating portfolios. We are committed to continue to drive top-tier performance, which we have been achieving in active fixed income and in some of our new active equity positions. Especially in emerging markets, we continue to see very, very positive alpha, which I'll talk about in a second.","Retirement continues to be a theme for us and we remain very, very well positioned. Our defined contribution clients generated $7.4 billion in net inflows in the quarter. And our defined contribution franchise has now crossed over $440 billion in AUM, up 19% year-over-year. Our key component of our retirement solution is our Life Path target date suite. Our Life Path assets have grown 40% over the year.","Finally, we are seeing good momentum in parts of our alternative platform, particularly single-strategy hedge funds and alternative solutions as clients are rerisking and looking for customized alternative programs as clients are rerisking.","In the U.S., we have had more than 10 new institution client funds alternative mandates with us in the quarter. Clients are also responding to the breadth of offerings on our platform with interest in our illiquid offerings. Due to the nature of some of these products, we will not realize revenues for some of these commitments immediately, but we'll see as a -- see the results as the capital is drawn down.  This strength is also overshadowed by outflows from a single large hedge fund with challenged performance over the past few quarters, which I'm pleased to say this year that fund is up over 5% and it's back over the high-water mark.","BlackRock Solutions continues to have a very strong momentum. BRS revenues were up 2% since the first quarter of 2012. And our Aladdin business posted very strong year-over-year growth of 11% due to multiple successful implementations and growing client base. So far this year, we've added 7 new Aladdin clients and we are in the process of implementing close to $1.3 trillion in new assets on to Aladdin. Our momentum in BRS and Aladdin is as strong as ever.","We're seeing existing clients adding new capabilities and new clients recognizing the advantage of the Aladdin network. I still believe we are just beginning to unlock the full capabilities of our Aladdin business.","My last comment on institutional is our pipeline, which remains very solid with approximately $35 billion across index and active mandates. Importantly, a lot of these active mandates are in our high-performing single-strategy hedge funds.","Let me move on to performance. As I mentioned on previous calls, last year we made a number of investments to enhance our portfolio management teams to improve performance and add capabilities. Now we are building a track record in those product areas. We are confident that these results will yield into flows over time, which we're already beginning to see some in some of the areas. Our fixed income performance has been very solid. Approximately 79% and 81% of our active fixed AUM exceed benchmarks for peer mediums for 1 and 3 years. This has helped drive net new business in our retail fixed income products up to $5.4 billion this quarter.","Our scientific active equity performance has been in the top tier for the past several quarters. At the end of the first quarter, 77% and 92% of our AUM was above benchmark or peer medium for the 1- and 3-year period.","Our U.S. fundamental equity franchise is a work in progress, which we discussed quite extensively last year. We have our teams in place. And in most cases, our teams are outperforming their benchmarks. And we'd still need more time to demonstrate that performance, but I believe we have the right teams in place.","In EMEA and Asia, we are seeing very strong performance, and it shows in our flows. In multi-asset, performance has been strong. Our global allocation funds, which makes up a large portion of our assets in this category, is at a record asset level as of a few days ago and has delivered a 12% annualized return over the past 10 years with 1\/3 of the risk of global equity markets. This is exactly what we told our clients we would deliver, and our team is delivering those results.","Alternatives continue to be -- continue to build great momentum. This is an area where I've been most pleased over the last quarter and it shows in our performance fees. As a firm, we remain totally committed to continue to build out our alternative space. We believe this is an area -- as we discussed, barbelling -- we believe this is an area where more and more clients are going to be seeking out BlackRock for advice.","As Ann Marie discussed, as a firm, we remain very strongly committed to driving increased shareholder value, and our capital management decisions reflect that commitment. In January, we announced an additional 12% increase in our annual dividend of $6.72. And during the quarter, we also completed repurchase of approximately $250 million of our stock. 2013 will be our 10th year paying a dividend. On a compounded annualized basis, we increased our dividend by 24% since 2003.","Over the past 2 years, we've continued to enhance our talent with a combination of external hires and elevating high-performing talent from within. Our external hires include Mark McCombe, who runs EMEA -- Asia Pacific; Philipp Hildebrand at EMEA; Hsueh-ming Wang from -- who is our Chairman of China; David Blumer, our new head of EMEA; Gary Shedlin, our new CFO; Gerardo Rodriguez joining in April to focus on emerging markets strategy. But in addition, which does not get enough highlighting, is our continuing elevated of our high-performing individuals internally. Adding new members to our global executive committee to continue to push for new perspective. Mark Wiedman has been added as Head of our Global iShares; Rob Goldstein, Head of our Aladdin and Institutional Business; Patrick Olson as our Head of Global Strategy and Planning; Quintin Price to run our active portfolio management capabilities worldwide. We continue to be pushing our internal team for more opportunities and pushing them into greater and greater leadership roles as we build out our platform.","We live in a world that is continually changing, and our clients facing increasingly complex challenges. BlackRock will always be willing to change and adapt to our clients' needs and I'm committed to serving our clients with the best talent in the industry.","I'd like to just close by taking a minute to recognize and thank Ann Marie for her help. She's a friend and she's been a terrific CFO, building a world-class finance capability over the past 6 years. She's going to do equally well in our client-serving opportunities and helping us navigate our complex client relationships in the future. And I know Gary will be able to take over for Ann Marie in a very swift manner.","So let me just restate what I mentioned at the beginning of the call. This was a strong quarter for BlackRock and our shareholders. We remain diligently focused on consistency and execution, and we are not going to become complacent. In many ways, we have just begun to see the power of this platform. And I believe we have ample opportunity to maintain this growth and possibly accelerate the growth.","With that, I'm happy to open it up to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to dig a little deeper on the new alliance with Fidelity. I'm wondering if you guys know what the level of iShares' AUM was on the Fidelity platform as of quarter end. And then I'm wondering what are your longer-term penetration targets for this platform, and maybe if we can think about the speed that you expect to gain some share on this platform, too.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, that is not a public piece of information that I'm -- I can't be responsible for discussing that, so just bear with me on that. But our enthusiasm is quite great with the opportunity we have -- the opportunities we have with Fidelity. The first 3 years were a success and what our new announcement is to build from that success now by adding up to 65 ETFs, iShare ETFs onto the platform have given us much greater opportunity to build greater penetration with their clients and a deeper conversation with their client-serving team. I would also add though, Craig, this also enriches our relationship in a totality basis. Even as from their distribution side, it just gives us a better opportunity to sell our mutual funds and other products there. So we look at this as a comprehensive relationship. The working relationship with our teams is very strong. But importantly, I look at what we are doing with Fidelity to complement what we're doing on our core strategy ETFs. This is what we deemed as the most efficient way for us to target a buy-and-hold RIA channel. This is an area where we said over the last few quarters, we under-penetrated. When we announced our core strategy ETFs, we said this is the channel we're going to go after. But by enlarging our partnership and our relationship with Fidelity, it really enhances our ability to interact with the independent RIA channel.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. And then just one follow-up. You had $112 million of security lending fees in the first quarter. How should we think about the seasonal pickup in 2Q due to the timing of the European dividends? And I'm wondering will this be a similar year to 2012 when we think about the comparison, or are there some key differences?","Ann Marie Petach","Well, when I look at it, really the fourth quarter and the first quarter in sec lending both looked very similar to a year ago and look similar sequentially. And so I would continue to expect a seasonal pickup in the second quarter associated with the dividend fee sec.","Laurence Douglas Fink","But what we -- I would say in the first quarter, what we saw was greater -- we had more securities out on sec lending, and so the trend was good in terms of utilization. But because of the continued compression in rates, we saw less rates. So lending spreads was less. But more importantly, and this is an important characteristic -- we spend so much time, we have a huge team out there trying to look out across all the prime brokers and all the different organizations that are looking to barbell stock. We -- I look at not just at our, obviously, our -- the net interest spread. I think the most important characteristic in sec lending is the amount of securities out to borrow. And this is the one area that I'm pretty proud of our team in making sure that we have deeper penetration. And hopefully, that will continue. I'm not here to tell you the seasonals won't change, but we most certainly saw more demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","One quick one on the numbers. You mentioned 7 new clients for Aladdin, and I think it was $1.3 trillion in process of being brought on board. I don't -- I highly doubt that it's directional, but that would imply about a 10% bump to the current base fee run rate in Aladdin. Is that -- am I in the ballpark of new fees coming on board?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, it's certainly a 10% increase in possible assets in that, so that's what you're getting at. 10% -- no, it's less than that. It's -- I'm not going to get into the details, but it's -- one client is quite large, and has economies of scale and all that stuff. But it's -- you're in the range but not there without getting into much detail.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. I can live with that. Curious -- you've spoken in the past that the bond ETF penetration is literally about 1\/10 the size of the penetration of the equity markets has enjoyed. Curious what you're seeing and expecting there. And then if you could talk towards what you spoken about recently in terms of the fixed income ETF and corporate bond lend, when we might expect that product to be coming out?","Laurence Douglas Fink","The iShare bond is going to be -- is momentarily, without getting into registration issues, we expect it soon. I'm getting kicked by my General Counsel. It is my view that this is a great opportunity for the market and for us. We've had many conversation with many potential investors in those products. The enthusiasm is great. But as we saw in most ETF products, it's a slow grind, and people are going to be looking for liquidity and opportunities. And if the liquidity and opportunities are there, then you start seeing a faster ramp-up. So it is momentarily when we're going to announce -- when we launch that. The overall view of ETFs and bonds is as robust as ever. We are very constructive on those products. And so my feelings haven't changed at all despite, obviously, a huge change in momentum from fixed income flows that we witnessed the first half of last year to 90% flows in equities. And so I guess it's a testimony to the products that these are efficient vehicles for investors when they are looking to rebalance, to restructure. And so we continue to be in front of clients with all types of ETF products, and we continue to be driving those flows on a global basis. You didn't ask this question, but if you look at ETF flows as an industry, some of the great flows as an industry are also when investors are under-invested. So you see great flows in Japan because of the changes in the economic future of Japan or the hope of the change of economic future. And so you're seeing it across the industry, larger flows in Japanese-oriented DK-oriented [ph] ETFs. And as I said, what we saw also at BlackRock, because a renewed interest in Mexico, we were -- we saw larger-than-historical flows into Mexico. And so this is exactly how we're trying to position ourself, having a suite of products that are global in nature and respond to it. This is one of the big reasons why we are so excited about our inclusion of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF platform. This will give us a great Swiss franc product as clients are going to look to diversify in currency and in asset categories.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","A quick question on the margin. You have unparalleled scale, a number of product categories that arguably have incremental margins in the 70% range or more. So without dismissing the progress you've been making on the margin, which is really encouraging, if you were pressed to explain why your margin isn't higher, can you point to any structural explanation for that in terms of business lines, product mix, geographic presence? And what is really preventing you at this point from having an industry-leading margin or actually the industry leading?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm going to -- let me give you my view and I'll let Ann Marie talk about it. A, I think our 40% first quarter margins are pretty impressive. Two, we did great investing in our new equity teams. When we launch our -- when we do win these Aladdin assignments, they actually, in the first year, drag our margins down because they're basically cost-related types of assignments until they're fully implemented. We continue to build and reinvest in the company. So as I've always said, I'm going to continue to invest to build a better company in the future with a mind of having increased margins. If I wanted to play the margin games, I certainly could ramp up margins dramatically, as you suggested. But at this time, because of all the opportunities I think we have as a firm, I'd be harming the overall company for future growth. So -- and the other thing is, let's not underscore the amount of spend I have related to regulatory inquiries and regulatory compliance. We are spending a great deal of time now putting all the requests in terms of information flow on to our systems. This will actually benefit our Aladdin clients one day, too, as we put these types of refinements for BlackRock onto the Aladdin system. But these costs are large and I suggested that last year, and I will continue to suggest that now. One of the outcomes of increased regulatory uncertainty, there is always a need for more lawyers, and so as my General Counsel raises his hand. And so I actually believe we are being judicious in the way we're managing margin. I have always claimed I expect to see higher margins in the future as we continue to build. And I agree with you, we do have some very high-margin businesses, but I'm not going to -- I'm going to continue to build for a better future. Ann Marie?","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. I just wanted to chime in that to remind people that the pro forma margin in 2009 of the combined BlackRock-BGI was 36.8%. And first quarter, and especially this first quarter, with the reorganization costs in it, was a very strong margin. So there's been enormous progress, and that's leveraging the business that we're committed to continuing. It's always going to be balanced with making sure that we're growing that top line, which is where the real value comes.","Laurence Douglas Fink","If you strip out the onetime expense of the reorganization, that would add over a 1 margin point to the quarter. I'm not suggesting we're going to continue to be at 41. I don't know where we're going to come out. But we all -- as I said before, we have an eye to continuing to build and grow our margins.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That was really helpful. Second one for me. I know there were some hope that ESMA would clarify its guidelines for sec lending in Europe. But it looks like the document that was released in late March left some of the key issues kind of vague. And there's still a question, at least in my mind, whether you're allowed to profit from this activity. So could you just help us understand how binding the ESMA rules are, who has the final say on all this, and what your outlook on the regulation is? And then along with that, you earned about $500 million from sec lending in 2012, so what is the split between Europe and the U.S.?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Matt, do you want to go into that?","Matthew J. Mallow","Yes, sure. The ESMA guidelines are still being reviewed and analyzed by all of us and haven't yet been finally determined. We know that everyone has these concerns about our ability to continue receiving sec lending fees. But let me just say that with the -- we do know that the guidelines have confirmed that we can charge fees and we're going to see where they wind up. But we support ESMA's efforts. And as fiduciaries, we already provide a high degree of transparency and disclosure, which is what some of this was about. And we're working with national regulators. National regulators have to implement a lot of this to preserve the benefits of securities lending for clients and the broader capital markets. So it's early days, and we'll be back and we'll see where this all goes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question, Larry, you didn't really talk about it in your prepared marks, but there was one SEC commissioner came out suggesting that there could be a money market proposal in the next month or so. So wondering what are you hearing in terms of what it might be and how you might be prepared to react if it's onerous?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I expect it's going to be some form of floating NAV. I mean, I see no evidence to think it would be anything but a floating NAV on the prime type of funds. I don't believe it will be any form of floating related to the government type of funds. So I think -- I don't -- we don't expect any surprise. We had a whole team in Washington this week. It's still pretty -- it's not -- it's a pretty dynamic situation, but I do believe now with the commissioner of the SEC being -- and the chairperson being finalized, I think we're going to see some type of announcement from the SEC shortly.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So second question, so a two-part question. One is I want to verify, Ann Marie, did you say that G&A will be flat year-on-year despite some seasonal sort of quarterly trends? And then the second question is, part of that is, with the Fidelity arrangement, is that accretive to the overall margin of the company?","Ann Marie Petach","So the first question, what I said specifically was with respect to marketing, but that's a key component of our overall G&A. And absolutely on the second. I mean, we think this is going to be a real win-win.","Laurence Douglas Fink","On the -- we -- marketing is a variable expense. We will spend more money when we believe it's an -- there's a great opportunity. And if we believe that the business dynamics don't permit it, we will spend less. So it is something that we can adjust continuously, and so it is going to be fluid and we will continue to navigate around that. And I will affirm what Ann Marie said related to Fidelity; it is accretive immediately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc  Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Larry, just on the trends and flows this quarter. I'm curious if you can give us a sense of the -- maybe the more cyclical rotation that could happen. You mentioned that. I guess you don't really see this great rotation happening, but there's a search for yield. Do you -- did that sort of dynamic accelerate throughout the months this -- so far this year as sort of events unfolded in March? Did you see any change in sort of people maybe preparing to take on more risk? Just curious what clients are saying.","Laurence Douglas Fink","There's no question. We saw greater risk-taking worldwide, and so -- but that doesn't mean it's a great rotation. It just means people are looking to take risk in other forms. As I said, they're looking for equities that are more bond-like with high coupons, low vol. They're looking for fixed income that has higher yield that looks more like equity. I think those are the overall trends, and those trends continue. Obviously, we saw at the beginning of the first quarter, a huge rerisking. But the rerisking came from cash, not from bonds. Secondarily, as we've witnessed about a 40 basis point rally -- rates went down in late March and now April -- we saw probably a slowdown in some flows but in the last week, we've began to see a resurgence in flows again. But I would say, overall, Marc, clients are looking to add more risk. Clients are looking for that market setback to buy. I don't sense a market setback is going to have people running back into more bonds, but I think if we had a market setback, I think we would actually see more equity investments.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then on the active equity business, I guess, there was some bigger -- an uptick in outflows. It looks like institutionally driven from fundamental equity. Do you have any sense of where we are maybe in the cycle of...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Recognize that, that's almost over. That was just a reaction in -- 2 clients, actually, did predominantly because we changed the portfolio managers. It is something we were not surprised at. We were disappointed. We were trying to have them stay in those -- with the new managers because we believe it's an improvement, but they had some -- they have these formulas of changing -- of moving on if there are some big changes. And this is -- these are the costs, and this is why so many firms are afraid of changing managers even with mediocre performance. And we made a conclusion mid-last year that we are going to rebuild for the future. We're going to spend the money in recruiting great teams, and we're going to take the short-term hits in terms of the potential outflows. But in the areas where we are seeing performance, some of our emerging market equity teams that have been here now 1.5 years with great performance, we have many dialogues worldwide. We continue to see some very strong flows, as I said in my prepared talks about -- in European equities where we have a world-class team. We continue to see flows in our dividend equity side. So I would say, the best way I can talk about the first quarter for me was a mixed picture. It wasn't as robust as we -- I would have liked to have seen it, but it certainly wasn't terribly bad and unexpected. But we're -- I think in terms of seasonality, in terms of those clients' decisions, that's behind us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So you've talked at length about the growing interest by investors, both retail investors and institutions, in risk. But what about the choice of active versus passive? It's sort of hard to tell from the data, quite frankly, whether this surge into equities paired with continued strength in fixed income points to a resurgence in interest in active investing. Or whether the multi-decade trend that we've seen toward passive investing, both indexing and ETFs, continues unabated. What's going on?","Laurence Douglas Fink","That's a very good question. There's no question from our vantage point we saw more barbelling than ever, more interest in beta products, both ETFs and index products, across the board. We're actually witnessing some of the largest global institutions who were heavily, 5 years ago were 100% in active, they are now navigating the majority, their reinvestments and their new investments in beta. So there's no question, as you said, there is a very dominant trend towards greater and greater participation in beta. As I also said, one of the uniquenesses of ETFs and iShares, we are seeing more and more investors are driving ETF flows because they're using beta as alpha. And so I think that trend will continue. I am making a large, long-term bet, though, that there will be a time when investor behavior will move back into fundamental equities. I can tell you as in our case where we have really good performance, we've seen flows. I'm sure by looking at industry flows, other firms that had strong, consistent returns that beat the index after fees are still -- are seeing flows. And so I think what you're seeing is you're not seeing overall trends in active fundamental equities, but you're seeing it where there is good fundamental performance after fees. This is another reason why in our prepared conversation, I talked about why we continue to build our alternative strategies, whether it is the SIO and CIO types of products and fixed income and our single-strategy hedge funds. We continue to see very large momentum there as clients are looking to use beta and then barbelling by other types of strategy. So we are making a fundamental view that equity -- fundamental equities will be a place where investors want to go but overwhelmingly, the flows continue to be driven in the beta products.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","My second and therefore my final question relates to your relationship with Fidelity. I'm very curious about the following. It seems to me that there are a handful of organizations in your industry, T. Rowe Price, the Capital Group and Fidelity, that literally stand for active management. This is their heritage, and this is what they grew up with. So I'm very curious to know when you were talking to Fidelity about why it's in Fidelity's interest, and presumably you had that conversation -- I'm not going to ask you to tell me what Fidelity was thinking. I want to know as the head of BlackRock what you were thinking and saying. When you were having that conversation with Fidelity about why it's in their interest for those guys to clone their active, industry-specific funds, for example, how did that conversation go?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, a, I think Fidelity is a tremendous firm. I think their fiduciary as strong as any firm that I know of. I think they believe in active management, as you suggested, and I think they understand that their clients are not only looking for active products, they're looking for passive products. And I believe that they have come to terms that if they are going to be as strong a fiduciary and looking out for their clients' interests that being in partnership with BlackRock iShares allows them to penetrate and continue to have that dialogue on the beta side, but also continue to be a fiduciary and drive also flows for their active products. So I think it's very consistent with a long-standing position of Fidelity of having fiduciary responsibility, first and foremost. And I would say all my conversations with the leadership of Fidelity has always been, they want to be known as a key long-term fiduciary for their clients. And I think this achieves that objective, and it also allows them to continue to build and drive their active flows.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First on maybe Solutions outside of Aladdin. To what extent are you seeing more pension and sovereign wealth funds stepping up their interest in outsourcing asset allocation to BlackRock? And does a risk-on world weaken demand to outsource or does a low interest rate environment sustain that interest? And ultimately what gets these big entities to pull the trigger?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, we asked Craig Phillips, who is driving our FMA business, to drive that solution-based business. Ann Marie, in a few weeks, will be a leader of that business. So I'm going to let Ann Marie talk about that a little bit and I'll add, so...","Ann Marie Petach","What I would say is there's a lot of different types of opportunities there. And it's not just a pure outsourcing of asset allocation, which is part of it, but it can be thinking about asset allocation for a portion of your portfolio. It's modeling assets next to liabilities and planning your asset strategy next to your liability strategy as you're thinking of that including your cap contribution strategy. I think that asset allocation in the present environment has been a key contributor to beta. And I mentioned that in my remarks because we are seeing people using ETFs as a tool to asset allocate. And we can help people to use these tools to get there, combined with the risk pools to actually understanding what they're doing, where the returns are coming from and where the risks are coming from. What's interesting, when you look at a number of clients, including very big sophisticated clients, they don't actually understand that combination of risk analysis with return analysis.","Laurence Douglas Fink","So, Ken, I don't believe -- we're having more dialogues with more large clients than ever before on the solution fiduciary type of businesses. So the dialogue, whether it's a low rate environment or risk-on or a combination of both, we're seeing more and more clients interested in it.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what gets them to pull the trigger? When do we start to see more of these conversations actually turn into mandates?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, we won -- we just won a $1.5 billion mandate this past week. And it was a multi-asset category with many alternatives. It was a great team-wide win. We are -- we had another dialogue with another client about a $10 billion possible assignment. I would like them to pull the trigger on this $10 billion one as soon as possible, but we are in dialogue with many different clients right now on this. What I have witnessed in these types of conversations, though, there are long gestation period to get the clients comfortable on these type of assignments. But when they pull the trigger, it's generally a big event here at BlackRock.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of investment, you really backed income products and that was really the right decision. As we think about alternatives, what are the alternative solutions that you want to emphasize over the next 5 years? And is there an analogous situation in the income products like in the alternative world, is there something that is really just going to be a hit that you want to scale up and build and...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Probably the biggest area that I can think of is, and I talked about this in my prepared remarks, I believe more and more investors are very worried about the asymmetry in long-duration fixed income. And so they are looking for alternative products that have -- doesn't have a duration benchmark and it's trying to navigate around that. So our SIO product, which I suggested, raised another $1 billion. And I believe with our performance, we should be at $15 billion, $20 billion. This is in the top quartile product. It is beating our 2 largest competitors by a significant amount in this product, and we should be growing this dramatically. The other area that I believe over, as you suggested, a 5-year period, 10-year period of time, it is going to have to be -- continue investing in the emerging world, whether it's Mexico or Southeast Asia, in different categories, whether it's going to be in debt products or in equity-like products. So it's going to be a combination of multi-asset strategy and a continue to investing in the emerging world, where we're making equally large investments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones, actually. First, I just wanted to ask about the success thus far in merging the iShares and retail sales forces, how you're seeing that play out and success on non-Merrill platforms?","Laurence Douglas Fink","It's too early to making some grandiose comment. I could tell you my teams are telling me it's quite successful. There is great enthusiasm there. But we -- whether we are seeing any short-term milestones, I think what's important, what we're -- and our messaging to all our clients by doing this -- and this gets back to some other questions we had earlier. And this is related to -- we have to be in front of our clients providing them information both on beta and alpha products. If we cannot do that, then nobody can. We should be the organization that's getting in front of the FAs, the RIAs in a open form of talking about the attributes of alpha and beta. And they should not be -- it should not be inconsistent or it should not be communication through 2 different voices. Our whole idea was because we believe if we are truly a fiduciary to our clients is providing a wholesome conversation on the attributes of beta and alpha, the combination of passive products and active products and how can they fit in a portfolio. And so we needed to re-engineer our own firm to making sure that we are -- we're telling the story in a proper way. So I believe in the long run, it's going to generate increased penetration. It may mean continue investing in our teams, it may mean more investing in our technology to provide better information for our teams to sell those products in a holistic way, but I am truly committed on the idea of providing a wholesome client relationship on beta and alpha.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just one -- a little bit more kind of granular housekeeping question is just in terms of comp. There are a number of moving pieces. You have the seasonality in the first quarter. You have the $33 million severance and you have the fact that you guys are saying you're going to end the year with higher headcounts. So I'm just wondering, first of all, with the new hires you have, is there a full run rate in the first quarter? And the incremental heads that you're adding over the course of the year, should we be thinking about that as lower cost per head than you have right now or in line, or how should we be thinking about that?","Ann Marie Petach","As you recall, we're not going to add a lot of costs in base comp. And I think our key comp driver is going to continue to be our variable comp, which is going to be dependent on the performance of our portfolio managers, as well as the performance of the firm overall. While we've added people, we have also made significant moves in our footprint over the last 2 years that has dampened the fact relative to the number of people that have been added to the firm.","Laurence Douglas Fink","We'll be very aggressive in managing those expenses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just on the iShares, in the past, there's been some seasonality. I know last quarter, you mentioned that you're not seeing it as much or some of the structural growth is offsetting that. So just wanted to get your view on that. And then one topic that sometimes will pop up is when you look at the 2 series that you have with iShares and the 1 on the kind of the old series, there's different fee rates and you've always mentioned that part of that is because of the liquidity. Just wondering, over time, if you're really successful on the new series and if those new assets get to a certain level, is there anything that stops clients from moving within the different products? I mean, are there any nuances among the different series that would prohibit that?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. I mean, if we have great success in our core strategy and the assets grow dramatically there and liquidity grows there, you would see some form of arbitrage over the long run. But I would also add, though, when you talk about total costs, and one of the reasons why we were very successful in some of our higher management fee products has been our great success in providing higher and more efficient tracking than our competitors. And so once again, I have to remind all investors who -- and I wish our -- I wish the agencies that we viewed alternative -- all ETF products look at not just management fees but they look at tracking error and look at bid-ask spread. So you calculate those 3 characteristics of the total experience of an ETF. In some of our higher fee products that you were talking about, actually, because of positive tracking, we actually outperformed. And so you have to look at it in a total cost experience, and that's an -- that's an important characteristic to look at it. This is one of the reasons why I don't expect to see the arbitrage anytime soon. You have to look at it on the total client experience. And that's important to understand why you're not seeing massive changes in clients' demand in different products.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And then just maybe on the seasonality and then probably just bigger picture. When you look at the iShares opportunity and when you look at the amount that you guys, when you see it, the different distribution channels and where you're at versus where you could be over the next 3 to 5 years, like what inning are you in that build-out or in that penetration and that could be both on the equity and obviously on the fixed income it's much, much earlier?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I actually believe we're in the third inning. I actually believe there's huge upside opportunities. I think people are miscalculating the continued growth, both institutionally and somewhat retail on utilizing ETFs as beta as alpha. We're seeing even the traditional index players, clients who were looking to add ETFs to provide a little greater liquidity in their index portfolios. We're at the first inning, second inning, and fixed income as ETFs will continue to play a bigger role. But I can't -- I think the first quarter, when you think about where the industry flows are, it would really, in my mind, really shows how dynamic ETFs are. When you see the huge increase in equities because clients were underweighted in equities, they're overweighted in cash and so you saw large purchasing of equity ETFs. In addition, just by the growth of ETFs in Japan and Mexico, it really highlights that this is not just a domestic U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon that clients are using ETFs not just to get beta exposure but to also get exposure in region and exposure in categories. And this is the whole story of what we're trying to do with iShares that we can provide beta exposure across regions, across countries, across products. And if we can provide that consistently, more and more clients will come to iShares.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jeffries.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess just to follow up on the fixed income, I think you mentioned some outflows that were specific to certain clients in the active segment this quarter. If you could rehash that, please. And then the other -- the opportunity within the ETF category for fixed income, you said there's been dialogue and demand, is that coming from your core base of active customers or is that from a new -- is that incremental to what you guys -- who you're already touching?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So in terms of outflow, and this is a merger-related client that had large sums of money in short-duration products that took the money out and bought a company. And one of them was just a restructuring from fixed income to another asset category. That was -- those are the 2 dominant themes in the fundamental fixed income side. In terms of our forthcoming announcement, we believe it will be new classes of investors in bond ETFs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hopson with Stifel.","J. Jeffrey Hopson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So 2 questions real quick. On ETFs, I realize, we're kind of slicing and dicing. But the most recent trends seem to be a little bit of movement away from the biggest plain vanilla product into really slicing and dicing, whether that's the Japan hedged products, whatever. You think that's just a short-term trend, number one? And depending on your answer, does that make you need to slice and dice even more? And then on margins, so the improvement year-over-year in the quarter was 140 basis points and there's some extra costs. So is there any reason why if the market gains hold that you couldn't show a 150, 250 basis point improvement in adjusted margins on a year-over-year basis?","Laurence Douglas Fink","So in terms of the rotation of ETFs and the slicing -- I think you're talking about the slicing and dicing. I think, as I said earlier, I'm repeating myself, but I really do believe if you look at the overall trends, we saw huge investing in the U.S. equities as the world started believing in the U.S. economic story. And we saw a huge investing in Mexico and Japan. As to Japan was obviously a country in which, historically, investors underweighted for years. And I think people were under -- we needed to get equity beta-ed in Japan. And Mexico was just the continuation of a great economic story. I think -- I don't think there's any grand story about mixing and matching. It just illuminates how people are adapting to use more and more ETFs as beta as alpha. And I think that's a very important component. I don't believe -- this does not lead me to believe that we have to mix and match and create more smaller and more divisible types of products. I think clients are looking for big macro-theme products. I don't believe investing in Japan alone is a macro -- is a mix and match or investing in Mexico is a mix and match. What we are seeing is sometimes, some clients don't want to invest in a global index like an MSCI. Some investors want to say, \"I want to highlight by owning 7 countries in that index,\" and they could do that with ETFs and iShares. So you have some clients who are saying, \"I would like to just invest in North America,\" so they could buy a Canadian and a U.S. and a Mexican ETF. So we're seeing various different ways that you could use ETFs and the simplicity of that. And I think that's the major story. It's not a story that we have to divide them up into many more categories. Lastly, in terms of margins, there is no question, as I said earlier, if you take out the onetime charge, our margins would be 100 to 140 basis points higher than it was -- than we announced. I don't like showing -- giving too much granularity on margin. I've always said we expect to see higher margins consistently year after year. Obviously, margins are beta dependent. They're performance or fee dependent. But we will continue to navigate and monitor our expenses. I can control expenses, and that's my commitment to you. I can't control beta. I do believe we'll have higher markets over the course of this coming year. So we will be very disciplined in terms of managing those expenses related to what goes on in performance fees and beta. So what I'm suggesting, you should assume pricing margins predicated on beta. But this is something that we are committed on, and we believe we have great opportunities to expand the margin without harming the future growth of the company. And that's how I'm trying to manage it. We will continue to make sure we are making investments. We will continue to make sure that we have the best investment teams. I will be relentless in making sure we have a firm that is based on performance, and that's my commitment to all of you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. Great quarter. I want to thank all the employees. Once again, our hearts and wishes are out to all those who experienced this -- the problems associated with the Boston terrorist act. We live in these uncertain times. We live in times of -- that are really tough to reconcile at times. And it is our job to provide some consistency to our investors to overcome, once again, a lack of confidence that terrorist acts like this presents to us and our entire country. So with that, let's continue to hope for a great second quarter, and I will be talking to you shortly. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer Gary S. Shedlin; President Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question and answer period. (Operator Instructions). Mr. Mallow you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow ","I\u2019m Matt Mallow the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry and Gary make their remarks, as usual, let me remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements and we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results, may of course, differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the FDC which lists some of the factors that may determine the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today and additionally, as is also usual, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not and will not undertake to update any such forward-looking statements. With that, let the call begin.","Gary S. Shedlin ","It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present our third quarter as adjusted results. Our roadmap for shareholder value creation is predicated on three main drivers: generating consistent organic growth; demonstrating the benefits of scale through operating leverage; and systematically returning excess cash flow to our shareholders. We successfully navigated that roadmap again this quarter generating double digit earnings growth.","More importantly however, and as you\u2019ll hear in much more detail from Larry in a moment, BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet the needs of our clients. Our global reach, unique blend of active and indexed offerings, strong overall investment performance, risk management and analytics capabilities, and One BlackRock culture differentiate us today in the asset management industry.","BlackRock delivered third quarter earnings per share of $5.21, up 34% compared to a year ago. Revenue rose 15% to $2.8 billion and operating income was $1.2 billion, 24% higher on a year-over-year basis. Non-operating results reflected a $43 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments largely driven by mortgage, private equity, and credit related investments. ","Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 20.2% reflecting discreet benefits primarily due to the resolution of certain outstanding tax matters related to the acquisition of BGI. In connection with that transaction, BlackRock recorded a $50 million indemnification asset for unrecognized tax benefits. ","Given the resolution of these matters, we recorded $50 million of G&A expense to reflect a reduction of the indemnification asset and an offsetting $50 million GAAP tax benefit. Both the $50 million G&A expense and the $50 million tax benefit have been excluded from our as adjusted results. ","Our 26.2% as adjusted tax rate for the third quarter also benefited from $34 million of discreet tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 29% is a reasonable tax run rate for the fourth quarter and based on what we know today 30% is a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015. ","BlackRock\u2019s third quarter results were driven by $29 billion of long term net new flows representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3%. Flows were positive across all client businesses and regions, and despite a more volatile market environment, we continue to demonstrate the stability of our highly diversified platform. ","Over the last 12 months BlackRock generated $134 billion of long term net new business representing 4% organic asset growth and an even faster rate of organic based fee growth as we benefitted from positive mix change associated with our faster growing higher fee retail and iShares businesses. ","Third quarter year-over-year revenue growth of 15% or $377 million was driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees, and revenue from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base free growth across all long dated asset classes. Base fees increased $315 million or 15% from a year ago as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market appreciation and the acquisition of the MGPA real estate business. ","Base fees were up 1% compared to the second quarter due to higher average AUM levels and the impact of one additional revenue day, partially offset by the seasonal decline in securities lending activity we typically see in the third quarter. However, we enter the fourth quarter with lower spot assets under management than our average AUM for the third quarter which will impact our fourth quarter entry rate base fee level. This decline was primarily driven by the appreciation of the dollar against foreign currencies, which given the global nature of our business, led to an $89 billion decrease in total AUM during the quarter. ","Performance fees for the third quarter increased $37 million or 39% from a year ago driven by continued strong performance across our broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate, and hedge funds solution offerings. As a reminder, fourth quarter performance fees in 2012 and 2013 were elevated due to similarly sized one-time fees trigged by the wind down of opportunistic funds related to the financial crisis. We do not anticipate any such fees during the fourth quarter of 2014.","BlackRock Solutions revenue of $165 million was up 6% year-over-year and 13% sequentially due to increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business which represented 72% of BlackRock\u2019s solutions revenue in the quarter grew 6% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We continue to successfully execute on large global implementations associated with record new business wins in 2013.","Our Financial Markets Advisory business had a very strong revenue quarter driven by several large advisory assignments associated with ECB AQR Diagnostics. Notwithstanding a more institutionalized post financial crisis advisory model, future FMA results may be difficult to predict as a function of the transaction based fee structure associated with this business. ","Total expense for the third quarter rose $141 million year-over-year driven primarily by revenue related items including compensation and direct fund expense. Compensation and benefits increased $112 million from a year ago or 13% reflecting higher head count and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. While compensation as a percentage of revenue declined year-over-year, partly as a function of the timing of certain accruals, quarterly comparisons are less relevant as we manage compensation on a full year basis and our overall compensation policies have not changed.","G&A expense decreased $8 million year-over-year or 2% driven primarily by beneficial non-recurring items including the positive FX impact of remeasuring dollar balances held overseas to their respective functional currencies. Sequentially G&A expense decreased $51 million reflecting the previously mentioned impact of positive FX remeasurement and lower legal and regulatory expense in the current quarter.","Excluding the positive impact of these items and taking into account a planned seasonal uptick in yearend marketing and promotional spend, we expect to see higher G&A expense in the fourth quarter relative to the first three quarters of the year. Overall, total expense increased 9% from a year ago compared to a 15% increase in revenue over the same period resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 44.2%. The year-over-year margin improvement of 300 basis points was positively impacted by the previously discussed lower level of G&A and compensation accruals in the quarter.","We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the third quarter we repurchased an additional $250 million of stock and view that as a good planning rate for the remainder of the year. As you are all aware, we traditionally review our capital management strategy with our Board each December for implementation in January of the following year.","Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our diverse platform, long term client relationships, and commitment to alpha generation. Quarterly net flows were positive in both our active an index franchises as well as each of our geographic regions with $11 billion from the Americas, $7 billion from EMEA, and $11 billion from APAC. ","In global retail we saw long term net inflows of $5 billion during the third quarter bringing year-to-date inflows to $32 billion or 9% annualized organic growth. Retail flows were positive at both the US and internationally, but were limited by macro headwinds during the quarter that impacted our high yield and European equities franchises. ","BlackRock\u2019s diverse platform was well positioned to weather this market volatility as we nonetheless delivered overall positive flows with strength in outcome oriented offerings including unconstrained fixed income, multi asset, and alternatives products. US retail flows of $2.8 billion were driven by strength in our outcome oriented fixed income suite including our strategic income opportunities fund or SIO, our strategic municipals opportunities, and global long\/short credit funds. ","During the quarter SIO raised $2.9 billion in net new flows from a combination of retail and institutional clients and remains the number two bestselling active mutual fund in 2014. Retail fixed income results were dampened by outflows from our high yield franchise which was impacted by investor rotation out of the sector in July. Though our high yield bond fund has top decile performance, the fund experienced quarterly outflows of $1.6 billion. ","Our 40 Act Alternatives Funds raised nearly $600 million of net flows during the quarter and we continued to see significant opportunity associated with delivering institutional quality alternative solutions to the retail marketplace. We recently expanded our retail illiquid alternatives suite with the launch of the Multimanager Alternatives Strategy Fund which allocate assets to a variety of affiliated and unaffiliated alternative investment managers and leverages the success of our hedge fund solutions platform BlackRock Alternative Advisors.","International retail net inflows of $2.1 billion were driven by our fixed income multi asset and index capabilities but were impacted by deteriorating market sentiment in Europe contributing to $3.8 billion in outflows from our European equities franchise. Within fixed income, we saw $1.2 billion of flows into our fixed income global opportunities fund which is the cross border version of SIO and $680 million of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration Bond Fund.","International multi asset net inflows of $1.9 billion reflected demand for our BGF Global Allocation Fund as well as growing traction for the cross border version of our flagship Multi Asset Income Fund. We also took advantage of strong three year performance track records in Asian equities to capitalized on increasing demand with our top cortile BGF Asian Dragon and BGF Asia Pacific Equity Income Fund and our top decile BGF China Fund generating more than $500 billion in aggregate flows during the quarter. ","Globalized shares generating $18.2 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of 7% driven by strong equity flows. Equity flows of $3.8 billion were driven by flows into the Core Series as well as demand for emerging markets and Asian equity exposures which offset outflows in European equities. ","The buy and hold segment remains an important growth challenge for iShares. During the quarter we generated $7.3 billion of flows into US Core Series representing annualized organic growth of 23% and gathered $2.5 billion of flows into recently launched European Core Series representing annualized organic growth of 26%. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market. iShares show fixed income flows of $3.7 billion [inaudible] by $1.3 billion of flows into our core bond product AGG as investors looked for options to maintain exposure to the broad fixed income market in the current environment. Year-to-date iShares ranked number one in market share of fixed income net flows globally. ","Our institutional business generated $5.6 billion in long term net inflows for the quarter primarily reflecting index net inflows. We continue to see sizeable asset allocation driven flows both into and out of institutional index products as bar-belling continues to be a key [inaudible] among institutional clients with cost effective beta exposure being paired with alternative solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. ","Index fixed income inflows of $5.5 billion was driven by LDI activity including extensions of hedging or liability matching services. Institutional active net inflows included $5.2 billion of net inflows into multi asset class products driven by continued demand for our LifePath Target Date suite and over $1 billion of flows into our Dynamic Diversified Growth strategy of DDG. DDG is an unconstrained multi asset strategy that seeks to generate positive consistent returns in a range of market environments with significantly lower volatility than an equity portfolio.","Multi asset and scientific active equity inflows were offset by outflows from active fixed income and fundamental equities. Despite strong performance across our active fixed income platform, our institutional net flows were impacted by several client specific outflows driven by rebalancing and asset allocation decisions partially offset by continued strength in unconstrained fixed income strategies. ","As you\u2019re going to hear from Larry shortly, our broad fixed income platform and performance track record continued to position BlackRock extremely will to capture opportunities in the current environment. ","In institutional core alternatives, inflows into hedge fund solutions were offset by outflows from several single strategy hedge funds and return of capital. However, we had another strong quarter of fund raising in illiquid alternatives with nearly $1 billion in commitments reflecting ongoing momentum in hedge fund and private equity solutions and infrastructure. As a result of strong fundraising in illiquid alternatives over the last two years that has brought in over $9 billion, we still have approximately $7 billion of committed capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our inflows immediately, committed capital only translate into flows and assets under management as those dollars are invested. ","In summary, in a quarter marked by increased volatility, our diversified business model delivered solid financial results and we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous opportunities that lay ahead of us. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink ","Thank you Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining the call. We\u2019ve seen some meaningful shifts in market dynamics since we spoke last quarter. Divergent monetary policy, changes in global economic growth expectations, and heightened geopolitical unrest all impacted the investment landscape and resulted in higher volatility in both asset prices and currencies in the past few weeks. That volatility is likely to continue as conflicting central bank policies and questions about the timing and magnitude of US interest rates hikes, led to an ongoing market uncertainty.","Investors are also questioning whether the ECB\u2019s recent efforts will be enough to reinvigorate the economy and stave off deflation. I believe it\u2019s going to take longer to stabilize Europe than many think and we are likely to see an aggressive ECB behavior for a long time. ","It is in these times of volatility and uncertainty that clients turn to BlackRock for answers and we\u2019re having more conversations with our clients that are deeper and more meaningful conversations than ever before. Clients are turning to BlackRock because of our platform that we built over the past 26 years as a result of a comprehensive and deliberate process focused on culture, technology, and talent. ","Our platform is built on the foundation of our One BlackRock culture, a belief in putting our clients first in all that we do and managing risk better and more thoroughly than any other asset manager in the world. We built Aladdin with this in mind, to create a premier risk management and technology platform that allows everyone at BlackRock to speak a common language. BlackRock doesn\u2019t eliminate risk but it helps us to create an environment where our team is constantly aware of the risks and we are connected across the firm worldwide to optimize these results.","Increased connectivity through Aladdin and other sources leads to improved communication and in the BlackRock investment institute we have a forum for investment teams to share knowledge, to share insights with the idea that this will enhance Alpha generation across the firm. This team based approach is a critical differentiator for BlackRock. We do not and never had have a centralized CIO. We don\u2019t have a house view or any one person setting a single investment strategy for our platform. ","Our process enables our teams to make independent portfolio construction decisions to meet client objectives. That may result in differing performance for our clients at times but it means we don\u2019t have an overwhelming bias towards one strategy or another and we minimize the risk that it entails. We also believe that having a deliberate process to develop our people is critical for BlackRock\u2019s success and our connectivity with our clients. ","At our most recent Board meeting in September, we spent two days reviewing 320 individuals at BlackRock across the entire firm to identify BlackRock\u2019s best talent. This is an annual exercise and includes a process to develop each of those individuals as global leaders, as global investors, and as global citizens. This might mean moving into a new region of the world or into a new business and it helps to develop a team that will be deeper, with broader and global experience which will enable us to have better investors and better leaders in the future.","The leadership changes we announced in the second quarter is an example of how we do this. The move involved new roles for 10 senior leaders across the firm and those leaders are now in their new seats driving growth and enhancing our value proposition for our clients. Finally, BlackRock\u2019s global diversified platform is a critical component of our strategy.","BlackRock is the only asset manager to offer active and index capabilities globally across all asset classes on one platform and we are constantly looking to innovate to find new ways of meeting our client\u2019s needs. When we combine our people, our technology, and risk management investment platform and wrap it all in the One BlackRock culture, the totality of the firm comes together to serve our clients\u2019 needs.","Nothing here is accidental. BlackRock was built to highlight these strengths and to minimize the risk of getting it wrong. While we will never compromise on our philosophy of building our culture, sometimes we do get it wrong and when we do we will do what\u2019s necessary to rebuild. We rebuilt our scientific active equity platform which now has 96% of its assets above benchmark or peer mediums for the last three years and while flows have not improved as quickly as we might have expected given the strength of the performance, this quarter we saw inflows in scientific active equity for the first time since we did the merger with BGI.","We made changes in our Asian equity business several years ago and Andrew Swan today has a top cortile three year track record. As you know, we\u2019re now in the process of rebuilding our US fundamental equities. We are excited about the progress we are seeing from our new teams and remain committed to that effort. ","Our confidence in our ability to rebuild the US equity platform stems in part from the success we\u2019ve seen elsewhere highlighted by the rebuilding process we started over six years ago in our fixed income business. The investments we made in that business are clearly paying off. BlackRock saw $11.1 billion of net inflows in fixed income in the third quarter and now we have seen, in total, $48 billion year-to-date in fixed income across both active and index reflecting the stability, the breadth, and the strong performance of our fixed income franchise.","We have a deep bench of talented senior fixed income investors with more than 400 fixed income investment professionals including 150 sector specialists. They manage $1.3 trillion in AUM across a full range of high performing active, index and iShare strategies. With 87% of BlackRock\u2019s active taxable fixed income assets above the benchmark or peer mediums for the three year period, BlackRock\u2019s offerings are positioned to help clients achieve their desired investment outcomes regardless of their specific needs or macro expectations. ","Our unconstrained fixed income strategies continue to be a core theme for clients and we saw nearly $5 billion in flows in the third quarter and nearly $20 billion in the last 12 months across our top cortile unconstrained bond franchise including SIO and strategic municipal opportunities in the US, our fixed income global opportunities product in Europe, as well as our flagship retail alternative fund global long\/short credit. We have seen continued momentum early in the fourth quarter as well as heightened client interest and we expect unconstrained strategies to remain a strong driver of growth for BlackRock going forward.","The breadth of BlackRock\u2019s fixed income franchises further highlighted by our top decile total return and high yield bond funds in total return we\u2019ve seen a significant recent increase in flows and client interest and see a meaningful long term growth opportunity. In high yield, while we experienced some market headwinds in the quarter our performance continues to position us to win in this asset class. ","As a result of BlackRock\u2019s strong active fixed income performance track record, we\u2019re increasingly being rewarded by retail and institutional gatekeepers with improved positioning on platforms and buy lists. We see a sizeable opportunity in fixed income in the coming quarters and we believe BlackRock is the best positioned firm in the industry to capitalize on that opportunity both in active an in index. ","On the index side, more and more investors are recognizing iShare as an efficient tool for investors to manage market exposure to generate Alpha through asset allocation. Investors have been increasingly turning to iShares as core component of their fixed income portfolios. In the first few weeks of October we\u2019ve seen more than $7 billion in net new flows into fixed income iShares including our Barclay\u2019s Aggregate ETF AGG. We\u2019ve seen a substantial uptick in secondary market trading volume as well exhibiting iShares ability to provide liquidity for our clients.","BlackRock believes fixed income ETFs represent a substantial growth opportunity given they only represent about 4\/10ths of 1% of the global fixed income markets. A fraction of the ETF penetration compared to the equity market where ETF represents about 3% of the global markets. We believe iShares can offer an attractive solution to the needs for fixed income liquidity with nearly $200 billion of AUM across a 189 fixed income ETFs. BlackRock\u2019s product breadth and depth are key differentiators.","I need to reflect for a moment because when BlackRock acquired BGI five years ago BlackRock\u2019s global iShares assets under management were $385 billion. I\u2019m proud to say that BlackRock\u2019s iShares closed the third quarter with nearly a trillion of assets under management. We continue to drive global expansion and grow our iShares market share by pursuing several areas of [inaudible] ETF usage including core investment, precision exposures, and financial instruments. ","BlackRock\u2019s ability to combine active and index strategies and deliver the entire full firm to clients is critical as client demand for investment outcome and solutions increase. One of the most common outcomes investors are targeting is to sustain a certain level of income leading up to and through retirement. Just this month, we launched an income campaign in Europe and the Middle East targeting advisors and consumers with a dual objective of raising brand awareness for BlackRock as well as educating clients on the importance of income investments as part of their portfolios.","Outcome oriented income focused products have been a significant driver of retail flows and products like SIO and multi asset income or MAI were significant contributors to our results in the third quarter. Our global basis or our multi asset income franchise crossed over $10 billion in AUM and as seen $4.5 billion of net inflows so far in 201. BlackRock\u2019s multi asset franchise is a key differentiator and our team based culture enables our multi asset managers to benefit from the best alpha engines and risk management capabilities BlackRock has to offer.","I\u2019d like to turn to a business through which we serve as a trusted advisor to some of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world. This is our financial markets advisory business or FMA business within BlackRock solutions. Since BlackRock started FMA business in 2008 we have completed now more than 330 assignments for 185 clients in 30 countries generating more than $1 billion of revenues in BlackRock solutions. ","In the third quarter we reached a significant milestone for the team and the firm. With the substantial completion of FMA\u2019s crisis era liquidation assignments. FMA\u2019s track record includes the risk control liquidation of long term wind down vehicles totaling more than $110 billion which resulted in strong performance for our clients. That track record also includes supporting clients with execution advice on strategic transactions totaling more than $660 billion.","As a result of this track record of proven success and a more stable environment marked by heightened financial regulation, we are now helping clients position their balance sheets to maximize value and thoroughly managing risk including numerous assignments as part of the Dodd-Frank Stress Test in the United States CCAR planning initiatives, the ECB AQR and most recently in August, the FMA business of BlackRock was selected to provide consultancy services to the European Central Bank on the design and implementation of their ABS purchase program. This marks a real transition for the FMA business from a crisis oriented work to differentiated advisory and consultancy services.","In all our businesses BlackRock strives to be a trusted advisor to our clients from institutions to end consumers. As a trusted advisor to our clients we also believe we have a responsibility to engage with regulators to promote a safe and sound financial system. We know there is growing concern for many around about liquidity and markets. We believe our success at BlackRock depends on investor\u2019s continued confidence in the markets and so we have a shared interest in working with regulators on these issues.","In closing, I want to share with you the reaction to BlackRock I witnessed during the last four days where I spent at the IMF Annual Meetings in Washington DC last week. During that time I met with more than 30 clients. In total BlackRock meet with 141 clients who are among the world\u2019s leading financial institutions and I was struck by how BlackRock\u2019s reputation and position in the financial marketplace came through in each and every meeting.","Investors are turning to BlackRock for advice and for investment solutions and it was a very gratifying time for us to be as part of these exceptional discussions and to see the actions clients are looking to give to BlackRock to be a thought leader and to help them provide them with better financial futures. ","I believe BlackRock has never been better positioned to meet the needs of our clients around the world. We remain focused on performance, we remain focused on strengthening our leadership team, remain focused on developing our talent, remain focused on enhancing our differentiating platform to unlock value for our clients, and of course, to our shareholders. ","With that, I want to thank our leadership team and all of our employees for delivering a strong quarter and continuing to work towards building better financial futures for our clients. Before we take up your questions I wanted to mention that in addition to Gary, Matt, and myself here in New York we have Rob Kapito joining us on the line from Hong Kong where he and the BlackRock team there are hosting BlackRock\u2019s Second Annual Asia Wealth Symposium bringing together our clients across the region.","Rob is also leading our fourth Knowing BlackRock Event, a series of internal events around the world that are part of an ongoing effort to foster a One BlackRock culture, to foster driving better leadership, and to foster driving better performance and better execution. Let me open it up for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I wanted to ask a question on the alternatives business and I think Gary, you mentioned in your comments that you obviously had some realizations, returned some capital, and also had maybe some outflows from discreet hedge funds. But if you look at that business it\u2019s pretty sizeable, it\u2019s a hundred odd billion and that\u2019s one place that despite the success you\u2019ve had across the firm where flows have continued to be kind of break-evenish despite the size. Can you maybe give us a little bit more color on underneath the business, kind of maybe which strategies are having kind of the flow issues or some of the puts and takes, if you will, that are going on behind it?","Laurence D. Fink ","I\u2019m going to open it up and then I\u2019ll let Gary really get into some of the details. We are very excited about our flows and the situation we have in alternatives. We have returned some large pools of money back to our investors. We had huge [inaudible] mortgage strategies that we liquidated in July that were quite successful to our investors and so that is a decline in our assets.","But in our illiquid strategies we do not put those assets under AUM until those monies are invested. So we have a firm commitment for those monies, and that\u2019s now totaling $7 billion of flows over the last few years and they continue to grow, and we put those monies to work over the course of the next several years. So in reality, we are recycling our alternatives strategy quite successfully and I believe the momentum is accelerating towards more opportunities for BlackRock in the hedge fund arena.","I\u2019ll let Gary go into some specifics, but the macro number masks the successes we\u2019ve been having. ","Gary S. Shedlin ","Rob, no one would like this to be a little cleaner and simpler to understand than I would and we spend a lot of time on it. But we\u2019ve got about $113 billion of total alts of which we classify $88 billion of those effectively as core and we strip out currency and commodities from that when we think about the core business. I think obviously, as Larry mentioned, return on capital, it does complicate the matter a little bit. I mean, obviously, this quarter alone we had return on capital of a little over a billion which effectively matched about a little less than a billion of new commitments that we raised in the current quarter. ","Year-to-date, our return of capital is about $2.8 billion and that was again versus last year where it was close to $3 billion. It\u2019s clear that over the last two years, I guess since the beginning of \u201913 and Larry mentioned we\u2019ve raised about $9 billion in commitments and I think, you know, candidly we\u2019re looking for the right opportunities. In a perfect world perhaps we would have invested some of that money a little quicker to basically match the timing better. But you know obviously, we\u2019re not going to put client interests behind what happens in our core flows in terms of return on capital versus putting the assets in the ground.","It also is impacted by a lot of ins and outs which, you know, is frankly the same phenomena that impacts some of our institutional index business. But, if we basically look excluding the return on capital, and I know this is a little unfair, but if we effectively exclude kind of one larger hedge fund that has frankly been a little more challenged in the last year or so and the way we look at the core health of the business, that would put up about $1.4 billion of core alts flows in the quarter with retail alts being about $400 million of that and institutional being about a billion.","On the retail side that\u2019s really again, being driven as Larry has mentioned, our flagship global longshore credit but we\u2019re also now having good flows from global longshore equity. I mentioned we recently launched the new multi manager fund which basically pulled in about $100 million this quarter already so that\u2019s off to a good start.","On the institutional side again, excluding return of capital and this one challenged hedge fund, we saw strong flows into BAA of close to $350 million, our fund to private equity business invested about close to $275 million in the quarter, real estate had about $200 million in the quarter. Our alternative solutions which is a key growth area, was close to $150 million. So there\u2019s actually very strong pockets of momentum around it however, it takes a little bit of commitment from you and us to make sure you can see all of that happiness.","Robert Lee \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","If I could maybe ask one follow up which I\u2019m sure is on a lot of people\u2019s minds, you know, the turmoil from one of your competitors and the assets that may be kind of in play or in motion as a result of that. I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in your thoughts as it relates to the DC world where, you know, certainly the total return fund has been pretty well entrenched and there\u2019s usually not a lot of fixed income options out there. But how do you feel about if you look at the opportunity set how do you feel about your ability to kind of start capturing some share there and at the same time are you starting to see more DC plans thinking about a broader range of options within their fixed income selections.","Gary S. Shedlin ","I think you\u2019ve identified a great growth opportunity for us. A, on the DC land, managers are entrenched until they\u2019re not. We have had a historically very strong presence in the DC side in the index equity and target date products and so we have great relationships and now because of our strong performance and breadth in our fixed income, we have an incredible chance now to leverage those relationships and indeed we are indeed winning more wins in the DC side and we do believe this is going to be a great opportunity.","In addition, as people think about fixed income especially on the DC side, we are seeing evidence of people moving out of a total return type of product into a more unconstrained strategies too so this is going to be an opportunity for us in the coming years.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Worthington with JP Morgan.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan","Topic de jour, a lot of the intermediate term investment dollars in motion \u2013 so first to what extent do certain categories of institutional investors already have so much money managed by BlackRock that it\u2019s hard for them to invest more with you? By following up with Rob in DC, you\u2019re doing so well on iShares in the DC channel, does that somehow constrain you on the fixed income side for example, or are there other categories?","Laurence D. Fink ","Ken, we have not seen one example where our scale and our presence with our clients are being impacted. We actually won some business from one client already in the DC side where when we did the BGI merger they were concerned about our large presence within their plans. Over the course of the years they\u2019ve become accustomed to our large presence and they\u2019ve indeed since then awarded us more business. Well, we\u2019ve been awarded more business again from them. ","So we\u2019re not seeing any evidence of that at the moment. I think importantly, more and more clients are separating the amount of business we have in beta products versus alpha products so I think we\u2019re in a very good position now to take on a larger share of wallet with more clients.","Kenneth Worthington \u2013 JP Morgan","Then money in motion again, it seems to be going into cash, short term bond, intermediate term bond currently, what asset categories do you think are best positioned over the next year? So for example when capital had its issues you had money go out of equities actually go into PIMCO and into fixed income so there was a big switch. What categories do you think are best positioned over the next year or plus?","Laurence D. Fink ","Where are you identifying the flows? Are you doing it in the mutual area? What people can\u2019t see is what\u2019s going on on the institutional side and let me just highlight the institutional side. On the institutional side, generally consultants determine how given managers are perceived and if there\u2019s changes in perception there\u2019s money in motion. That\u2019s a slow process, in some cases it\u2019s going to take quarters, maybe even a year. But we have had more buy recommendations added to BlackRock in the last few months mainly because of our five year success in performance. ","So much of it had to do with the timing of our success. There is not a single event that is stimulating some of this it is just because the consistency of our positioning in fixed income and obviously because the events that you\u2019re alluding to there\u2019s been more change. We are seeing more opportunities over the next quarters and years of money in motion into various fixed income strategies.","What we are seeing more and more clients looking at, they\u2019re looking for outcomes, they\u2019re looking for solutions. They\u2019re not moving money across asset categories so most of the money, if it is being moved, it\u2019s being moved from one fixed income to another fixed income player and then you\u2019re seeing biases moving. The one area where we\u2019ve just been awarded a big assignment is a big institution that would have been awarding us something in the total return side of fixed income and they determined to award us a large assignment in the unconstrained fixed income.","So that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing the biases change but there is a lot of money in motion going from total return in one shop to another shop and I believe there is quite a bit of movement today in the institutional side that should show up worldwide in the next few quarters.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse","First just to hit on the margin, the adjusted result of 44.2 looked very strong. I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide some color on the sustainability of this level and it also looks like G&A expenses were a little light driven by FX and there\u2019s always the seasonal G&A trends in 4Q which tends to be higher. So maybe just provide us a little color there and maybe you can help us in terms of what a good go forward range is?","Gary S. Shedlin ","So a couple of things on margins. Obviously, in the context of year-over-year comparisons you obviously have to look at the relevant quarters that you\u2019re comparing and so I think from Q3 to Q3 if you will a couple of things went on. Obviously, we had strong beta from that Q3 to Q3 period which obviously helps drive revenue growth and you saw not only in addition to our organic growth, we actually put up 15% year-over-year revenue growth which is a pretty good number.","On the expense side really two things. As you\u2019ve mentioned, one is our G&A clearly was low in the quarter. I think we highlighted sequentially that there was about a $51 million gap which was primarily attributable to the FX remeasurement and lower legal fees and expenses relative to the last quarter where we called them out as being somewhat high. ","So beta driving one direction, expense driving the other direction and then obviously, as we\u2019ve mentioned both this quarter and last quarter some changes in comp accruals that make quarter-over-quarter comparisons a little less relevant. But mentioning that we really hadn\u2019t changed comp philosophies and so as you look at full year accruals I think that\u2019s a better indicator.","Then of course you take all of that and you go into the fourth quarter and I think there\u2019s no question that beta comparisons year-over-year will look much less muted. It was a strong fourth quarter in beta last year. It\u2019s not looking like a very strong fourth quarter this year so that will impact obviously year-over-year comparisons. We mentioned the FX impact so we\u2019re going in with lower spot AUM into the quarter than our average and as you correctly mentioned, in addition to the seasonal uptick in our [MMP] spend which is actually also planned, we\u2019ve got some rougher comparisons on the performance fee because of the opportunistic fees that we booked last year.","I think if you take all of that into consideration I would suggest that the 44.2% in the quarter is probably not something we\u2019d be looking to repeat in the fourth quarter and I think as it relates to margin guidance, I think our margin guidance hasn\u2019t changed as it relates to the overall business.","Craig Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just a follow up on the management turnover at one of your competitors. We\u2019ve only had three business days in the third quarter result and we only have mutual fund data there but if you could size of the potential opportunity given your good performance, wide product menu across 401k, retail, and then institutional, which one are you more excited about in terms of growth in your active bond business?","Laurence D. Fink ","It\u2019s still too early to determine how much is going \u2013 it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s a sizeable opportunity. It\u2019s in the 10s of billions of dollars. We\u2019ve seen recent strong momentum but it\u2019s going to play out over quarters and maybe a year and as I said, it\u2019s going to be \u2013 in the core fixed income strategies it\u2019s going to be in the unconstrained fixed income strategies. ","You may see people, and I think there is evidence that you\u2019re seeing some people moving into ETFs and maybe this is as a holding pattern. But I just want to underscore we are seeing this type of flows because of our five years of performance. I just want to remind everybody that we had $48 billion of flows in the first nine months and so we continue to just think it is all about performance, it is all about positioning, it is also because of our strength in beta and alpha products and fixed income. ","So it is our platform that has also differentiated and our global positioning. But as I said this is a sizeable opportunity and there is increased momentum.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Kind of a big picture question here, you\u2019ve got institutional index strategies contributing just 10% of your revenues but I think those AUM receive about a 40% weight in the conventional calculation for organic growth. So if you exclude those assets I think the organic growth on what I think we might call revenue critical AUM has been ranging between 5% and 7% on a trailing year basis. I don\u2019t know of many asset managers of any size that are flowing at that rate and perhaps I\u2019m wrong, but it really doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s reflected in your multiple today. The question is sort in terms of messaging what\u2019s it going to take how investors view your organic growth rate.","Gary S. Shedlin ","Hopefully, you tell everybody. I mean, look it\u2019s a great point, it\u2019s one that you know we have been trying to tell a little bit differently than the way you just stated it both at investor day and even today. We\u2019re trying to basically point to a concept of organic based fee growth being in excess of organic asset growth which is by virtue of stronger growth in our retail and our iShares business, or obviously relative to the institutional business and in particularly institutional index business.","I would say that we do give you ways to get there in terms of the disclosure. There\u2019s ways to back that out but I\u2019m mindful that it\u2019s always easier if we do that for you and I think it\u2019s fair that we are always thinking about ways to improve our disclosure and to help investors and analysis better understand our business and we\u2019re actively considering whether or not we should make some changes going into next year.","I mean, we do break out on the AUM tables exactly that component of flows and obviously, the beginning balance of our institutional index business so you can actually go ahead and do that and I don\u2019t want to suggest that the institutional index business is not a very important component of the firm, but you\u2019re right to suggest it has lower revenue characteristics than some of our other businesses and that in markets such as this the velocity of those assets tends to be a little bit greater so even though you\u2019re seeing $5 billion of net flows there\u2019s basically significantly more inflows and outflows that happen every quarter to get to that net number.","So we take your point, we appreciate it, and we are going to give it a lot more thought as we go into the end of the year.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I think the fee versus AUM basis for presenting organic growth is interesting but maybe it\u2019s just as simple as showing organic growth figure excluding institutional index in your press release. That\u2019s what I might suggest.","Gary S. Shedlin ","I think that\u2019s one way to do it. Though again, that data is there for people who want to figure it out. ","Laurence D. Fink ","I would just also want to say that I don\u2019t want to dismiss the institutional index business and we love it, we think it\u2019s a growth area, we think it\u2019s a very important connector with our clients as I discussed earlier especially on the DC side which is really an institutional component and it\u2019s a connector to so many of our other businesses. That\u2019s the opportunity of it. Obviously, Gary and team will look at how we can better account so you have a better understanding of our growth rates and our revenues. But we don\u2019t want to dismiss a great component of our business.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Marc Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Marc Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just following up on the organic growth, you know, you are out there with a forecast for 5% organic growth and I just want to get a sense of two things. You\u2019ve constructed that view that you can get to that organic growth rate at some point in time and I think you\u2019ve given us some of the building blocks. Maybe you can just review that but also, what kind of assumptions are embedded in a forecast like that in terms of manager replacement? Obviously, there is a lot of money in motion, some of which you would have expected to be on the fixed income side, but I\u2019m curious also, manager replacement and volatility, how that sort of plays into that forecast and what we should expect?","Gary S. Shedlin ","A great question. Look, 5% when we laid it out was viewed as a target. It\u2019s an aspirational target. We\u2019re very serious about making sure we have strategies, business strategies, and appropriate talent, and making sure that we provide resources for those businesses to get there. We very much still believe in the fact that that is a number we can achieve. We are very much still focused on the three components of that growth with iShares being low double digit growth, retail being high single digit growth and our institutional business being low single digit growth obviously, with faster growing parts of that business offsetting some of the headwinds we face in DB.","So, we\u2019re continuing to prosecute the strategy and we still feel incredibly comfortable about that. I would say that it\u2019s not a quarter-to-quarter number for us. It\u2019s basically getting there on a more long term stable basis. We obviously \u2013 I\u2019ll come back to the discussion we just had with Luke, which is actually if you strip out some of the more lower fee components which have been a little bit more volatile in recent quarters, one might suggest that we\u2019re already there on a trailing 12 basis for some of those businesses but I\u2019m mindful that\u2019s changing the goal post a little bit and I think in the context, and Rob\u2019s on the phone, he may want to chime in obviously, there are significant amounts of cash yet on the sidelines that when that gets deployed that will actually have an important element to our ability to attract some of those assets.","I think we\u2019re still moving forward and we\u2019re holding people accountable to get there and our sincere hope is that we\u2019ll be able to, in the near term, be able to talk about getting there very consistently.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of William Katz \u2013 Citigroup.","William Katz \u2013 Citigroup","Just coming back to the money motion discussion [inaudible] very topical, Larry you highlighted sort of the five year track record as being a key differentiating factor for you. Just coming at scale the other way, how important is scale and capacity as well as a consideration for all the consultants as they think about incremental opportunities, maybe perhaps some PIMCO?","Laurence D. Fink ","As I said earlier Bill, I don\u2019t think CL is a negative, I think CL has proven to be a positive for us and we have plenty of growth opportunities in our unconstrained area. That\u2019s going to be the area where we will ultimately have capacity issues but we have measured that and we have a lot of bandwidth to continue to grow in our unconstrained strategies. This is something we look at with our strategic product management group. This is the group that is trying to design new products and trying to eliminate products that are underwhelming. ","I think that\u2019s another reason why we are winning so much business in some many different fixed income strategies. I think the highlight is it\u2019s not just the active fixed. We actually won some inactive fixed, and unconstrained fixed, and iShares fixed income. We\u2019re seeing inquiry in our model based fixed. It is the scale and breadth of our fixed income platform across the globe, is the reason why we\u2019re having so much dialog with the consultants worldwide and it is allowing us to be well positioned for that money that is moving. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Michael Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You guys put a whitepaper out I think a few weeks back just on some of the issues in the fixed income markets and some of the longer term solutions. Just given the recent volatility we\u2019ve seen \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you want to call it hiccups but some new issues in terms of liquidity I just want to get your view, I think a lot of the things you guys discuss in terms of the long term fixed makes a lot of sense. Some of those things is just a lot tougher to do in the near term, you know, when we may fax increased volatility and given the amount of assets that have gone into fixed income and the reduced inventory on broker or dealer balance sheets I just want to get your sense what are you guys doing or what can you do to try to protect your investment returns in some of the lack of liquidity in the market which can impact the returns for investors.","Laurence D. Fink ","I would say overall the markets are performing quite well. There have only been a few circumstances where you\u2019ve seen really [inaudible] type of trading behaviors in the last few months. In any one single day or single week you may have seen some spreads widening but over a course of a two to three month period of time they narrow back. I think there\u2019s been some great consistency across the fixed income market.","That said, we are worried about the liquidity in the fixed income markets, especially in the corporate bond area where there is just so many different [inaudible] and so many different issuances and there\u2019s no consistency and importantly this is a big role that the investment bankers and Wall Street play in terms of providing balance sheet and navigating your positioning within the fixed income universe and that balance sheet has been reduced significantly and so it does, at times, present liquidity issues.","This is why we have been so loud in stating that we need a more expedient adoption of electronic protocols and markets. I do believe this is one of the areas where regulators need to focus. I spoke about this at an [IMS] session this past weekend, that I think it\u2019s imperative that we focus on this. As the regulators have put more capital demands on banks, by definition the capital markets are playing a larger and larger role in terms of financing corporations and financing different organizations. ","With that in mind now, we need to be focusing on how to improve the capital markets in making sure they provide a stable, a mechanism for buying and selling securities. We\u2019re in this transition phase right now and the faster and sooner we have this adaptation of electronic trading the sooner we have standardization of some form of corporate bond issuance, and then importantly we need behavioral changes across the board. ","This is going to take time and so the worry we have is do we have enough time before there\u2019s a true liquidity event that really destabilizes the market. This is why I said in my prepared statement, we need to be working with regulators to make sure we have a more stable trading environment. We are the biggest beneficiaries in the world as the largest asset manager. We benefit when there\u2019s greater liquidity. We need to make sure that our clients believe that investing is safe for them too so this is key.","Now, in saying that though, because we are a large client of all the different firms worldwide, if there\u2019s balance sheet that is off or just because of our relationships, we have an advantage but that\u2019s not a lasting type of thing and this is why we are so much in front, whether it\u2019s writing or working with regulators, working with the street to build a more robust electronic market.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.","Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI","Just a follow up question. You mentioned a couple of things impacting on the retail side but the last 12 months your organic growth rates is in like 11%, this quarter it was 4%. I\u2019m curious how much you think of that as more environmental versus maybe talk about some of the successes you\u2019re pushing through on your distribution strategies.","Laurence D. Fink ","As Gary suggested, we had outflows in high yield, that was environmental. We had outflows in European equities, that was environmental. On the positive side we had inflows in other products. I think it speaks very loudly to our platform. Obviously we want to be beneficiaries of all the areas where there\u2019s going to be inflows but there are going to be periods of time where our client interests are going to be navigating out of those platforms. ","We also saw even in iShares, in the last few weeks of September we saw large movement out of some European iShares products, European equity iShare products. So this is all environmental. We truly believe we\u2019re penetrating more distribution channels, more [RIA] channels, a broader distribution channel in Europe than ever before and so I think we are in a very good position for whatever is money in motion in the retail channels, we are going to continue to see some elevated growth.","We are strengthening our positions across the world. As I talk about our strategic product group we\u2019re evolving our product set so we are responding to the needs of clients and so I feel very good about how we are positioned in retail and iShares and importantly we are going to continue to build our brand and I think we have done a very good job at building brand awareness and now we need to continue to do that and be successful in that. Gary, do you have any more to add to that?","Gary S. Shedlin ","I mean to put some numbers into perspective in terms of European equities, I mean it happens, again maintaining still good three, five year performance there, you know, that cost us close to $4 billion in the quarter in retail in outflows and then high yield again top decile performance and rotation there cost about $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion for the quarter. So if you just think about the magnitude of those two products still with decent performance in fact, some exceptional performance in some cases, that [inaudible] the growth rate just in the quarter alone in those two areas.","So the good news is as Larry said, we had continued strength in the EMEA index, we had continued strength in fixed income, continued strength in multi asset, and I think without that there\u2019d be a very different story and that\u2019s part of the diversification and stability story we\u2019re trying to tell.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence D. Fink ","The last comment Gary just said I think is really key as you think about BlackRock. I think we have a unique business model, a unique culture that is differentiating us and once again allowing us to deliver a strong third quarter. We have never been as well positioned to meet the needs of our clients worldwide and I think clients are turning to us more than ever before because of the consistency over 26 years of a comprehensive and deliberate process of focusing on our culture, our team, our technology, and our talent and I think this is very critical.","As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, when we combine our people, and our technology, and our risk management on top of our investment platform and wrap it up with one common BlackRock culture, the totality of the firm comes together and it serves our clients well. I can say in the fourth quarter and going forward we\u2019re going to just be as intently focused on achieving our performance, on strengthening our leadership relationships with our clients, continuation of developing our talent.","As Gary said it really well, our highly diversified platform allows our investors to have a greater stability with more consistent growth than any other asset manager and I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks everyone. Talk to you at the end of the fourth quarter.","Operator","","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3345":["BlackRock, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind all of you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. And of course, we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And as we usually warn you, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, let the call begin. Gary?","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks Matt, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to be here to present results for the second quarter of 2014. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I\u2019ll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. as usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","At our Investor Day last month, I reaffirmed the growth framework, predicated on driving organic growth, using scale to create operating leverage in a consistent capital management strategy. BlackRock executed on each of these drivers during the second quarter, resulting in continued earnings growth. We generated second quarter earnings per share of $4.89, up 18% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Operating income was $1.1 billion, 15% higher than a year ago.","Non-operating results reflected a $37 million increase in the market value of our [Steed & Co.] investments. Recall that non-operating income in the second quarter of 2013 reflected $30 million \u2013 $39 million pretax gain related to PennyMac\u2019s IPO, and the results in the first quarter of 2014 were impacted by the monetization of a non-strategic opportunistic private equity investment.","Our 24.8% as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter benefited from several favorable non-recurring items and an improved geographic mix of earnings. As a result of increased growth in our international businesses, we now estimate that 29% is a reasonable tax rate for the second half of 2014. And based on what we know today, 30% represents a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015.","Our second quarter results were driven by $38 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of almost 4%. Flows were driven by our retail and iShares client businesses. As we discussed at Investor Day, faster growth in these businesses will drive favorable change in our revenue mix. And we once again saw organic base fee growth meaningfully outpacing organic asset growth during the quarter.","Second quarter revenue was $2.8 billion, up $296 million, or 12% from a year ago, and was driven by continued growth in base fees, performance fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions. We once again experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes.","Base fees increased $257 million, or 12% from a year-ago, as average AUM increased due to organic growth, market appreciation and the acquisitions of the Credit Suisse ETF and MGPA real estate businesses. Base fees were up 6% compared to the first quarter, aided in part by the seasonal increase in securities lending activities we typically see in the second quarter.","Performance fees for the quarter increased $26 million, or 29% from a year ago, driven by stronger performance in our broad suite of single strategy hedge funds, as well as certain long-only equity strategies. Recall that first quarter performance fees included a significant fee associated with the planned final liquidation of an opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund. BlackRock Solutions revenues of a $146 million, was up 6% year-over-year, but down 5% compared to the first quarter.","Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 11% year-over-year. Flat sequential quarter results for Aladdin were once again, impacted by the timing and recognition of certain revenue, as we continue to onboard a number of large clients onto the Aladdin platform.","We anticipate that several of these large clients will go live in the coming months, generating revenue uplift as we move past the implementation phase. Our financial markets advisory business continues to transition from a crisis management orientation to a more institutionalized advisory business model with continued momentum in bank regulatory-related assignments, including ECB AQR and Fed CCAR diagnostics.","As we mentioned in last quarter, FMA results have recently reflected higher levels of revenue associated with asset disposition assignments. While the second quarter of 2014 was also positively impacted by residual disposition activity, the revenue impact was at a lower level than recent quarters. Other income increased $17 million sequentially as a result of higher transition management service fees, earnings from certain strategic investments and real estate related disposition fees.","Expense for the second quarter rose $145 million year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue related items, including compensation and direct fund expense and an increase in general and administration expense. While compensation as a percentage of revenue declined year-over-year as a function of aggregate levels and mix of performance fees and timing of certain accruals, quarterly comparisons are less relevant and our overall compensation policies have not changed.","G&A expense increased $36 million year-over-year or 11%, driven primarily by increased occupancy and office related costs and other expense, including elevated legal and regulatory expense. Aggregate G&A expense in the first half of the year benefitted from a delay related to the timing of our total marketing and promotional spend, the balance of which is expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2014.","Sequentially, G&A expense increased $64 million from the first quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of marketing and promotional spend, increased occupancy expense, reflecting the dilapidation reversal in the prior quarter and the previously mentioned increased level of legal and regulatory expense.","Overall, total expense increased 10% from a year ago, compared to a 12% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.4%, 110 basis points higher than last year\u2019s second quarter.","We remain committed to a consistent and systematic capital management policy. During the second quarter, we repurchased an additional $250 million of stock, consistent with repurchase levels during the last few quarters and view that as a good planning rate over the balance of the year.","Through both transformational acquisitions and targeted organic growth, we built the industry\u2019s broadest asset management platform. Our diversification whether in terms of clients, products or geographies is a critical component of our strategy and enables us to deliver more consistent growth and more stable financial results over time.","Another element of our strategy is the growth opportunity in global retail. We saw long-term net flows of $13.1 billion during the second quarter; driving 10% annualized organic growth with positive flows across products and regions. results were driven by our outcome-oriented offerings, including multi-asset alternatives, and unconstrained fixed income and efficient beta.","International retail, once again, demonstrated stronger results, generating long-term net inflows of $8.9 billion in the quarter. Equity flows of $2.9 billion were led by net inflows into index funds, which have witnessed accelerated activity as the post-RBR European distribution model evolves and demand for efficiently packaged retail investment vehicles increases.","Multi-asset net inflows of $1.4 billion reflected continued demand for our global allocation fund, a key component of our packaged outcomes offering. Fixed income net inflows of $4.7 billion were driven by flows into short duration, unconstrained and high yield bond products, as well as index funds.","Within international fixed income, we saw $1.4 billion of flows into our BGF Euro Short Duration bond fund and nearly $850 million into our Fixed Income Global Opportunities fund or FIGO, which is a cross-border version of Strategic Income Opportunities or SIO, our flagship domestic unconstrained fixed income fund.","U.S. Retail\u2019s quarterly long-term net inflows of $4.2 billion were led by our duration managed fixed income suite and packaged outcomes, including our multi-asset income and global long\/short credit funds. unconstrained fixed income continues to be led by SIO where we\u2019re seeing strong interest from both retail and institutional clients. We also saw growing momentum in our unconstrained Strategic Municipal Opportunities fund or SMO, which raised over $500 million.","Global iShares generated $30.4 billion of net new business in the quarter, representing annualized organic growth of 13%, driven by strong equity flows. Organic growth for iShares over the last 12 months has returned to low double digits, consistent with our longer-term targets.","Equity flows of $20.6 billion were driven by a rebound in emerging markets and demand for developed market exposures. In emerging markets, EEM generated over $6 billion of quarterly net flows and in developed markets; we saw continued demand across a variety of exposures and geographies.","Fixed income net flows of $9.5 billion represented the leading share of fixed income ETF flows during the second quarter paced by flows into longer duration U.S. treasuries, investment grade corporates, emerging markets debt and high yield. The buy-and-hold segment remains an important growth story for iShares.","During the quarter, we generated $5.5 billion of flows into the U.S. Core Series; while also extending its reach and launching a European version of the core. Our institutional business experienced $5.5 billion in quarterly long-term net outflows, as net inflows into institutional active mandates were more than offset by net outflows in index equities.","Institutional active net inflows of $1 billion included $5.3 billion of net inflows into multi-asset class products, driven by continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite and fiduciary wins. Our strength in fundamental fixed income drove net inflows of $900 million with demand across unconstrained strategies; regional credit mandates and CLOs.","Institutional active equity outflows included fundamental and scientific outflows of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion respectively. We continue to experience outflows in fundamental equity products that are performance-challenged, though SAE outflows were primarily driven by partial redemptions from clients harvesting gains in appreciated portfolios.","In core institutional alternatives, net inflows into alternative, hedge fund and private equity solutions mandates were offset by outflows in certain single strategy hedge funds and capital successfully returned to investors. Nonetheless, strong momentum continues in alternatives with an additional $1 billion of commitments raised in the second quarter. Since the beginning of 2013, we have raised $8.5 billion of commitments across alternatives, $6.7 billion of which has yet to be deployed.","Future net new business will be generated as these commitments are invested. Institutional index equities experienced net outflows of $7.9 billion, driven primarily by portfolio rebalancing. In the face of strong equity markets and improved funding ratios, pension clients continue to rebalance their portfolios and as interest rates rise, we expect to see additional immunization activity if equity markets remain at or near current levels.","This quarter once again, demonstrated the breadth and depth of our business model. BlackRock\u2019s diversification continues to enable us to deliver consistent results, one element of S&P\u2019s decision to upgrade BlackRock\u2019s credit rating to AA-, making us one of the most highly rated firms in the global financial services industry. At Investor Day, we elaborated on the strategy to achieve our growth targets. We remain confident that we have the right strategy, tools and talent to execute.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. thanks, Gary. The second quarter marked the sixth great quarterly rise for the S&P 500, and rising markets, equity markets across the globe. This was driven by growing confidence in the United States, and in Europe, and in pockets of outperformance in the emerging economies.","The 10-year treasury is back to near 2.5%, the Fed continues to ease their bond buying efforts, and even in light of some of the recent volatility, the VIX is hovering near pre-crisis lows. Markets have been complacent in the face of this risk with down days quickly followed by elevated buying trends.","Credit standards are loosening, cap rates are falling, and correlations remain very high, following the spring shakeup in the global momentum trade. However, the positive environment and the market gains we\u2019ve seen in the past several years have been driven primarily by accommodative policy decisions and coordinated central bank actions.","More of the same won\u2019t be enough to move market forward from here. Corporate results and earnings growth will be needed to become larger drivers of valuation. That\u2019s where our attention has been, and in the past couple of days, we\u2019ve seen second quarter kickoffs with some bellwether names, posting very strong results.","Investors are also going to have to focus more economic growth to justify driving asset prices higher. for that to happen, governments across the globe must take meaningful action beyond monetary policy. The United States needs to address issues like immigration and infrastructure, and readers like Prime Minister, Abe in Japan, and Prime Minister, Renzi in Italy must advance their reform agendas to produce tangible economic results. Around the world, infrastructure is a key area where governments and private capital providers can partner to drive long-term economic growth and job creation.","At BlackRock, we remain highly focused on building a deep understanding of markets and evaluating risk from all angles. I believe that the accommodative policy we\u2019ve seen over the past five years will ultimately lead to increased volatility, as policy decision diverge and investors become more focused on the performance of individual countries, individual industries and obviously individual companies.","It is our responsibility, as a fiduciary to help our clients to prepare for this type of shift by building durable portfolios designed to perform over the long-term. We do this by providing our clients with a set of capabilities and a client experience that we don\u2019t believe anyone else in the industry can replicate. We talked at our recent Investor Day about the key differentiators that set BlackRock apart, and that will enable us to drive long-term results for our clients and importantly, for our shareholders. it starts with our people.","Talent and culture are critical to our success, and I\u2019m pleased to say that the management changes we announced earlier this year have gone into effect as of June 1. Our team is working together in this new structure to execute against our key strategies to meet the needs of our clients. I strongly believe that we have at this time the deepest, most talented team in the asset management industry and the strength of our next generation of leaders will drive BlackRock\u2019s future success.","BlackRock is the world\u2019s most global asset manager. We manage money for clients in more than 100 countries around the world through the combination of our on-the-ground presence in more than 30 countries and our ability to provide clients with the industry\u2019s broadest set of global and local investment solutions.","That global investment and distribution infrastructure positions BlackRock to capitalize on the future growth and development of the world\u2019s capital markets that will be necessary to support global economic growth. BlackRock\u2019s global platform generated $131 billion of long-term net flows over the last 12 months, representing an organic growth rate of approximately 4%.","These results were driven by our diverse investment platform, another key element that sets BlackRock apart from our competitors. We have expertise across asset classes and we can deliver that expertise across a variety of investment vehicles. We have active and index on a single platform, which helps us position the firm to meet a holistic approach and needs of our clients.","The second quarter showcases BlackRock\u2019s product breadth, with 12 funds across retail and iShares generating more than $1 billion in flows, tying a record number of $1 billion plus funds that we saw in our fourth quarter of 2013. These funds are spread across developed and emerging markets, domestic and international clients, equities, fixed income and multi-asset class, active and index, and short and long duration exposures, together demonstrating BlackRock\u2019s ability to be clients\u2019 needs across the investment platform and spectrum.","As I mentioned many times in the past, the diversity of our platform, our deep client relationships and our global footprint all positions BlackRock to deliver consistent financial results for our shareholders. And that consistency enables our management team to look forward at the key trends impacting our business and invest aggressively, where we see opportunities. One of those key growth areas is outcome-oriented investing. The investment landscape is shifting. Investors are looking for outcomes that target their investment goals, rather than benchmark-specific performance.","This outcome-oriented style of investing requires a combination of a diverse set of investment capabilities, and a focus, and a deep focus on client service. Most asset managers specialize in one thing, and so they look at every client problem to the lens of that one specialty whether it may be active investments or index investments, or fixed income, or equities. BlackRock\u2019s diverse platform allows us to instead to focus holistically on our clients\u2019 needs and draw upon and across the entire firm to meet our clients\u2019 needs.","The investments we\u2019ve made to build the combination of active and index across asset classes and regions, and our technology and risk management capabilities differentiate BlackRock in the outcomes and solutions space. And BlackRock\u2019s offerings of packaged outcomes continue to drive growth in the second quarter, particularly in our retail businesses.","Our five star multi-asset income fund, MAI, led by Michael Fredericks is one of our flagship package outcomes, an example of a fund that targets a critical challenge for our clients, generating reasonable income in a low yield environment by tactically balancing income across equities, fixed income and non-traditional sources of income. MAI has raised over $1 billion in the quarter and crossed the $7 billion mark in total assets. This fund has doubled in size organically over the last 12 months.","Similarly, in the unconstrained fixed income area, SIO has raised $3 billion in flows in the quarter, stands at over $16 billion in AUM, and is the second most active mutual fund in the U.S. in terms of year-to-date net new flows. The interest in outcome-oriented investing is especially strong among our institutional clients. they are increasingly looking for investment partners that provide analytical insight, thought leadership, and breadth and depth of investment capabilities, all which play strongly to BlackRock\u2019s strengths.","At BlackRock, we take a consultative approach with our institutional clients, focused on understanding their specific needs and leveraging Aladdin\u2019s capabilities to deliver investment solutions, a capability that is differentiated from other asset managers. Our relentless approach to risk management and technology positions BlackRock to offer a complete advice to our clients to help them not only achieve their returning targets, but to do so with a comprehensive understanding of their individualized risk and making sure they understand the risks that they are taking.","The combination of Aladdin, our global platform, and our investment expertise across broad ranges of strategies positions BlackRock to deliver highly customized solutions to all our institutional clients worldwide. For example, on the first half of 2014, we closed more than $1.6 billion in custom alternative commitments and we saw strong flows in our fiduciary business, especially, in EMEA and demand for our LifePath target date suite in the United States.","Our iShares business is also positioned to provide outcomes and solutions to a wide range of clients with differing investment preferences and differing objectives. iShares continues to be a major growth driver for the firm, delivering $77.5 billion of net flows in the last 12 months. And $30.4 billion of net flows in the second quarter across a variety of products and client segments.","As Mark Wiedman discussed at Investor Day, there are three ways our clients are looking at ETFs and iShares specifically. One is core investments, or building blocks to construct the basis of buy-and-hold portfolios; two, precision exposures to express a specific, a targeted investment viewpoint, and three, as a financial instrument to efficiently add beta exposure to a variety of equity and\/or fixed income markets in some case, replacing futures with ETFs and iShares. Each of these key product segments globally contributes to iShares\u2019 growth in the quarter, delivering the number one ETF flow market share position for both the quarter and now year-to-date.","Regardless of our strengths for growth, we cannot be successful, unless we produce superior investment performance. Nothing is more important than delivering performance for our clients. After the financial crisis, we restructured much of our active fixed income business. Our focused execution has paid off and we have strong performance across fixed income, with 90% of our active taxable and 70% of our active tax-exempt fixed income AUM is above our benchmark for peer medium for a three-year period of time.","As of the end of June, we\u2019ve seen strong performance in our fixed income total return fund, which is in the top decile for the one, for the three and a five-year period. Our low duration bond fund is the top decile for one and three years. And our newly launched Strategic Municipal Opportunities fund or SMO is in the sixth percentile for a one-year period of time.","We also continue to see strong performance in our scientific active equities with 93% of our products above benchmark or peer medium for a three-year period. And from our index offerings, where we have 98% of our assets, we\u2019re within or above the tolerant level, risk level for over a three-year period of time.","I have spoken at length about the steps we are taking in our fundamental equity business to improve performance. We streamlined our investment process and recruited tough quality managers to add to our existing talent base. Most recently, Chris Jones has joined BlackRock as our Co-Head of Global Fundamental Equities and is our new CIO of America Equity Teams. And Antonio DeSpirito joined us, or will be joining us in our Equity Dividend Team later this year, working very closely with Bob Shearer.","In the second quarter, several of our fundamental equity managers who had put up strong performance in recent months suffered a setback in a variety of global momentum aided strategies, and had produced strong alpha reversals. We recognize that we remain in a rebuilding phase in this business and though, we never like to see performance setback, we remain confident today in our capabilities of our teams and all our processes.","To give you a few examples of the strength of some of our new managers Andrew Swan, who manages our Asian equities and Bart Geer who manages our Basic Value are in the 14th and fifth percentile respectively, since they joined BlackRock. And that performance is starting to begin to pay dividends with flows. We believe that over time, fundamental equities will be a growth area for BlackRock. We believe the combination of investing in our talent and our global footprint, our access to information and idea-sharing and our risk management capabilities positions BlackRock to deliver sustained superior investment performance to our clients. We know this is a multi-year effort, and we are committed to seeing it through. These investments in our fundamental equity business will further enhance the depth and breadth of our global business that we build over time throughout BlackRock.","As I said at the beginning, we believe that BlackRock is a truly differentiated firm from any other firm in the world. We are seeing a consistent result that this model can deliver quarter-after-quarter. If you look at our growth on a year-over-year basis as adjusted, you will see we grew assets under management by 19%, we grew revenues by 12%, we grew operating income by 15%, and we grew earnings per share by 18%. That double-digit growth demonstrates the benefits of our diverse platform and our ability to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders.","And I am confident that we not only have the platform, but we also have the right leadership team in place to continue to drive growth in the future even as the environment continues to evolve as we know it will. Constantly, adapting to the changing environment and improving our performance is something we are intensely focused on. That is how we intend to continue to unlock value for our clients and then ultimately our shareholders.","Finally, I would like to thank our leadership team and our employees for delivering a very strong quarter and helping our clients build better financial futures.","With that, operator, let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Glenn.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Hey, how are you?","Laurence D. Fink","Good.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","So I guess the first question I have is the cost of leverage on the street is kind of rising as banks get their houses in order, and that pushes out the cost of leverage to various products that companies like yours run. So I\u2019m just curious, it certainly didn\u2019t seem to affect your flows in the current period, but in things like long\/short credit, multi-strat products that you\u2019ve had success growing, does that factor in at all in terms of a) the growth and b) the profitability of those?","Laurence D. Fink","That\u2019s a good question. There is no question, you\u2019re seeing, as you\u2019re referring to the cost of leverage, I will just say, the Basel III, Volcker rule, Dodd-Frank has forced many sell-side organizations to reduce their overall capital committing in the marketplace.","And two, you\u2019re seeing obviously, liquidity issues in some asset categories. Glenn, to date, we have not seen a dramatic change in our ability to buy or sell for our hedge fund strategy. But we\u2019re mindful of that, and indeed you\u2019re correct, if we see a continuing amount of inability to navigate our trades and we are seeing larger bid\/ask spreads, there\u2019s no question that can minimize the opportunities that our alternative products have.","I should say though one other ways that investors are utilizing, or trying to change their behaviors, and this is a growth engine for us, we\u2019re seeing hedge funds utilizing ETFs as \u2013 instead of futures or single-stock or single-bond strategies, they\u2019re using ETFs as the mechanism to express a long or short type of exposure.","So in some respects, if there\u2019s more liquidity in different products such as an ETF, you may see that. And so I think, in some respects, the changes in the world related to dealer behaviors is a benefit for the ETF market in itself, and we\u2019re benefitting from that and I tried to express one of the avenues in which people use ETFs. But one of the big things we have seen is the utilization and the cost of using futures, margins and all that has elevated and people are using ETFs as another example. But you\u2019re absolutely correct that we have to be mindful of liquidity by market in terms of the exposures we have in some of the long\/short products.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Okay. And maybe, just a follow-up, I appreciate that is related to alternatives, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a technical question, but the platform across the board seems great. Your retail penetration is clearly growing and yet the net flows into the total, the alternatives bucket is pretty modest.","Laurence D. Fink","Yes.","Glenn P. Schorr \u2013 International Strategy & Investment Group LLC","Less than $300 million this quarter, now I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a \u2013 some are growing, some are shrinking thing, or is it \u2013 the technical part of the question is, if you raised a lot, but have not deployed the capital, does it show up as a flow or does it show up as a flow when you get \u2013 my question is commitment versus funding?","Laurence D. Fink","We do not put commitment in our AUM bucket, some firms do. So, as Gary said in his speech, we did raise a little over $1.3 billion in commitments. Over the course of the year, we raised about $8.5 billion of commitments and we funded approximately 1.8 of it. That is a big change. We also \u2013 and we mentioned this in the first quarter and we\u2019re still doing it. We\u2019re actually monetizing some of our alternative products. So you\u2019re seeing our commitments grow, but we\u2019re not \u2013 but we haven\u2019t invested in that, and yet, you\u2019re seeing on the same time, we are monetizing some of our alternatives, because of the success of the strategies and we\u2019re giving back the capital.","Gary S. Shedlin","So Glenn, it\u2019s Gary. I would say one way to think about it is the return of capital hits the flows immediately and this quarter that was roughly $925 million thereabouts. And we were basically able to raise new commitments of $1 billion. So over the long-term, the new $1 billion that we\u2019ve raised will obviously replace the $900 million that we just paid out. but unfortunately, it takes some time to basically invest the money over the\u2026","Laurence D. Fink","Well, we take the more conservative approach the way we identify those with the asset raise.","Gary S. Shedlin","So Larry\u2019s point is that of the $8 billion plus that we\u2019ve raised since 2013, about $1.5 billion of that has effectively hit flows, meaning it has been invested and the dry powder or the $6.5 billion or $6.7 billion will hit flows over time as it\u2019s invested.","Laurence D. Fink","But we are probably in more dialogue with more clients on our alternative space than we ever have been in the history of the firm. So we like where we\u2019re positioned, but also we like the fact that we can monetize good successful strategies for our clients.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Marc.","Marc S. Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Larry. Just following on the alternatives question, the performance fee is always tough to get our arms around, the alternatives performance. But can you give us some sense maybe of what kind of embedded gains you have in some of the portfolios that you\u2019re harvesting, and maybe, what that means for the outlook? And then I guess just broadly across the alternatives platform, how is performance holding up there? Thanks.","Laurence D. Fink","I\u2019ll let Gary answer that.","Gary S. Shedlin","So Marc, as you know, we obviously don\u2019t take the approach to economic net income that some of the pure play alternative managers do. so as we effectively see gains building up, which trigger accruals of, if you will embedded performance fees. We fully reserve for that going forward until they become permanent and no longer subject\u2026","Laurence D. Fink","They don\u2019t report us.","Gary S. Shedlin","So that\u2019s not in our P&L and frankly, we don\u2019t really disclose those as a matter of course. I think obviously, you saw performance fees were up 29% year-over-year. I think the important thing to note for us is very broad based. So it\u2019s not a single fund that is basically driving that, it is a very deep. The breadth of the platform is evident in the fact that it\u2019s when you see the results, it\u2019s lots and lots and lots of different funds. Though it was clear that this particular quarter, we had a number of annual locks, meaning that they lock annually as opposed to quarterly, and we benefitted from a much stronger performance in this 12-month lock period than we did in the prior year. But broadly speaking, I think we\u2019re feeling very happy with the performance of the alternatives platform and the performance fees are coming through.","Laurence D. Fink","And we are, as I said Marc, some great opportunities we have, I mentioned in the speech, in the infrastructure space, where we think this is going to be a great driver in the future for us and our clients. And so we have great opportunities in front of us across the alternative space, Rob Kapito and team and Charlie have spent a lot of time in a quietly rebooting our whole alternative platform under Matt Botein and Andy Stewart, and it\u2019s been in the short-term, we\u2019re starting to see real tangible results.","Marc S. Irizarry \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then Larry, just one follow-on, can you give us some \u2013 an update, if possible, on any of the asset management regulation, and maybe, specifically any update around maybe the discourse on systemic importance for asset managers?","Laurence D. Fink","I wish I had something to tell you that is factual, I don\u2019t. We don\u2019t know anything more than what you\u2019ve been reading in the newspapers. Under Dodd-Frank, banks, anybody related to Dodd-Frank, whether it\u2019s SIFI, or anything. we\u2019re not allowed to have a dialogue, it is called lobbying, and it has to be publicly revealed that we\u2019re lobbying.","So there is not, there is \u2013 you don\u2019t have the transparency of the process at all. this is very unusual. Any other type of world creation in Washington, there\u2019s always a process of dialogue and this was explicitly prohibited in the law of Dodd-Frank. And so we don\u2019t know anything more than what we read, and unfortunately, what we read, sometimes we believe there are leaks.","And so it\u2019s a pretty inappropriate process from our perspective. But our job is a constructive participant in this. We have been occasionally asked to provide information to various different regulators worldwide on different things that they may be studying. It\u2019s a one-directional approach. we provide information and we get very little back and that\u2019s obviously what the laws say.","So I don\u2019t know anything more, but what I\u2019d like to do is give you some of how we think about asset managers and regulatory oversight. We calculated BlackRock, there\u2019s $225 trillion in global financial assets. Assets that are being managed by investment firms, managed $62 trillion of the $225 trillion. So over 70% of the financial assets are owned and managed directly by the owners. And the other thing I would like to say, as you know, these are not our assets across the board. We have a contract in what we invest in and how we invest with every client.","As you know, at BlackRock, we have hundreds of portfolio managers making decisions, we don\u2019t have one CIO managing all the assets across all the spectrum going left or right or forward, and we\u2019re \u2013 so this isn\u2019t, we don\u2019t take principal risk. And the last thing, I would just say related to BlackRock, if you dissect our platform, 62% of our assets or $2.8 trillion of our assets are index products. And then we manage about 32% of our assets are in active and another 6% in cash and advisory. So you think about the makeup of even as large as we look upon, much of our activities are very different than a lot of other asset managers in itself.","So we believe that narrative that I just expressed is beginning to be more understood. And there was a proposal in Congress yesterday to allow for greater transparency in the process, deeper dialogues in the process and we welcome that type of activity. And we want to be a constructive participant in this dialogue.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Luke.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. thanks, guys. So a couple of questions on retail distribution. You entered 2013, I think, with a range of new strategic initiatives. Then the results over the last year or so have been pretty impressive as indicated by net flows. But aside from some of the key products that drove that growth, you\u2019ve touched on them multi-asset in the Core ETF series. Could you give us a sense of how successful you\u2019ve been with the goal of really broadening that penetration with the warehouses outside of that relationship you had historically with Merrill Lynch.","Laurence D. Fink","Well, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m going to let Rob answer that. Rob, why don\u2019t you?","Robert S. Kapito","Yes. so we have grown significantly from being Merrill Lynch-centric on retail, and in fact broadened the distribution to several others in a very significantly way. And in fact, our market share at some of the larger warehouses beyond Merrill Lynch has more than doubled over the last two years. So we continue to penetrate, because we are bringing products that a lot of them do not offer, and especially, in the ETF side, we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth in that particular area.","There\u2019s other channels that have also been developed beyond just a typical warehouse, which is the RIA channel, of which a lot of financial advisors have moved from the large broker dealers into smaller channels, and we have pretty significant penetration in the RIA channel. We also as you know, have read about our joint venture was fidelity and that has been more successful than we had originally planned. So that broadens out our effort.","And one of the things that has really been successful for us is that rather than going out with individual sales forces for our ETF channel and for our mutual fund channel, over the last year, we have combined our sales force to have the largest sales force going out and talking to broaden the distribution and treating the FAs more holistically, because they own in their portfolios both mutual funds, active, index and ETF. So we can talk to them about a more holistic solution. And I don\u2019t think that many of our competitors can claim to be able to do that.","And the last thing that has also helped to broaden out the channels is that we announced a core series and are specifically developing in the ETF channel, specific ETFs for the buy-and-hold retail segment. And again, that\u2019s something that has also broadened out our retail network and has been very successful.","So many things are going from years ago when we were more Merrill Lynch-centric. now we have a much broader and deeper retail penetration in our products.","Laurence D. Fink","Let me add one other thing, Luke, which I think is not fully understood by the investment community, and that is the substantial growth in mutual fund sales in Europe. As you know, banks continue to deleverage, more and more activities are going onto the capital markets, greater confidence in Europe and the Europe\u2019s future with a huge amount of savings in Europe. And so we\u2019re seeing much greater penetration across the board in European retail.","So there are two other macro trends that are going on in Europe. one, domestic managers are losing out to the global international managers. And so across the board, you\u2019re seeing the international investment managers picking up market share in Europe.","And the last thing I would say you\u2019re seeing a real consolidation in flows. the top 10 managers in Europe are driving almost 90% plus, maybe 110%, I don\u2019t have the actual number in front of me, of all the flows, because with the smaller managers are actually having net outflows. but if you look at the substantial growth of $9 billion in international retail, this year-to-date that\u2019s a high component of our growth. And I would \u2013 I should say international retail means Asia, it means Europe, it means South \u2013 Latin America.","So let\u2019s get back to my comments earlier about being in 30 countries, being local in 30 different countries. We are benefitting from that, and we believe as the world begins to look for other alternatives away from bank deposits looking for the strategies for their retirement, if you link in longevity and longevity issues, investors worldwide are looking for global advice and we\u2019re very well positioned across that.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And so my follow-up and I apologize, Larry, because I know you chafe at the comparison of your firm to Vanguard\u2019s, but a question on the distribution strategy in retail ETFs and index markets. I think over the years\u2026","Laurence D. Fink","(Indiscernible) say I chafe.","Luke Montgomery \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Maybe I missed characterized that, but I\u2019ve heard some warehouse distribution executives over the years lament that Vanguard products basically free ride on the warehouse distributors who have to custody their products as a courtesy to FAs and clients. So I wonder do you see any specific opportunity based on your willingness to partner more directly with those firms to pay channel access fees, etc. Does that give you an opportunity to supplant some of the market share they\u2019ve acquired [concurrently] (ph)?","Laurence D. Fink","I\u2019ll let Rob answer that.","Gary S. Shedlin","Yeah. I don\u2019t think.","Laurence D. Fink","Bob, do you chase?","Robert S. Kapito","I don\u2019t chase that at all. I view our strategies as quite different. We\u2019re using; we\u2019re going to expand by education, the use of how ETFs are going to benefit client\u2019s portfolios, both institutional and retial. And I think in a product life cycle, this is very typical that you have people come in at first and you want to just get involved and then you have all the other uses of this product. Larry mentioned one for example, where we have a notice that ETFs are cheaper to use than futures. There is nobody better to go out into the marketplace and educate the community on a change like that than BlackRock is. And this is something that many of the other issuers of ETFs really don\u2019t think about. they are out selling products. We\u2019re selling a solution. An ETF is a part of that solution. when it comes to people that are looking for large credit portfolios, we\u2019re able to talk to them about a holistic solution where they can get diversification, liquidity and actually have a better structured portfolio by the use of iShares than just buying the individual assets itself. We have so many different ways that we are developing the users of ETFs that a broker dealer community and the institutional community looks to us to use ETFs as part of an overall solution.","So we\u2019re not out there just pushing one product versus another product, because it\u2019s half, we\u2019re using this as a full part of a portfolio allocation. I think that\u2019s very important. So it\u2019s core investments, it\u2019s to get more precision exposures into the marketplace and we are treating this as a significant financial instrument, not just a product that we hope to the garner more assets in. It\u2019s a very different strategy than Vanguard is. they\u2019re a good firm. So we\u2019re glad to compete with them.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Bill.","William R. Katz \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Larry, just coming back to the regulatory front for a second, maybe a two-part question, one is what has been the sort of reaction from the institutional clients given the SEC discussion about possibly voting on a prime fund with a floating-rate NAV? And then a separate part of the question is, in certain early days, it looks like MiFID out of Europe is coming up with some pretty onerous shifts of views on how they are treating research versus trading, sort of wondering how you might be thinking about that dynamic as it relates to your business?","Laurence D. Fink","So, we have continuously been a constructive organization working side-by-side with our regulators related to money market funds. So we\u2019ve been continuously engaged with the SEC throughout the process. we have made a number of recommendations. we have spoken to when asked about what we think about it, we\u2019ve had dialogues with many of the commissioners when asked, and importantly, we\u2019re well positioned regardless of where the SEC comes out on the portfolio \u2013 on the proposal excuse me. money is moving around and like we\u2019re going to see how this all plays out for our clients that when you think about where we are as a firm in terms of money markets.","We have money market funds; we have separate accounts, or money market accounts. we have short duration bond funds. we had ETF. we have other vehicles. Money will be in motion; money will change if clients find whatever the outcome is as very restrictive, they\u2019ll move money elsewhere. We will also see, but most importantly, we\u2019re well positioned and I do believe the SEC has been \u2013 have been very open to conversation related to recommendations and all that. We\u2019ll see how this all plays out.","The one thing I can\u2019t say, can\u2019t comment on, because I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t know what this means related to bank deposits, necessary, bank deposits could be even a better alternative. So obviously, money market funds are \u2013 in some cases, alternative to bank deposits and the flows of money market funds is a function of what bank rates are. But a lot of people are very mindful of how much exposure they would have with any one single bank. And so I think this is why money market funds are desired by clients and this is one thing that we try to express to regulators, clients like money market funds. And we\u2019re well positioned. We have many government funds as a separate account. So we\u2019ll standby and hear how \u2013 what the outcome will be from the SEC related to their decision. We know as much as you do. In theory, there is going to be some decision next week and we\u2019ll find out.","Related to MiFID and RDR in terms of regulatory changes, you\u2019re going to see consolidation with managers. Our risk management tools is a huge benefit. And I do believe our index ETF platform efficient exposures. I think you\u2019re going to see more movement towards ETFs as a result of the MiFID RDR type of regulatory changes. So it may reduce some of our business in Europe, but it\u2019s going to enhance the other side of BlackRock\u2019s business. And this is another example where, by the diversity of our products, our positioning globally really differentiates us.","So we are working with regulators; we are mindful of this. We are telling regulators what clients want, what they expect. But we\u2019re pretty well positioned one way or another related to whatever the outcome is related to MiFID and RDR.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Worthington \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Just one question from me. I wanted to ask about the retirement business outside the U.S. We\u2019ve seen changes to the UK Pension Plan this year, which appears to benefit maybe asset managers over insurance companies. The EU has been underway for pension reform for I think the last four years. BlackRock has had some success in the U.S. taking market share and driving growth in the U.S. retirement business. Maybe, Larry, you could discuss what\u2019s happening outside the U.S., and maybe, where the biggest opportunities lie for BlackRock?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, there\u2019s no question some of the rule changes in the UK is a big opening for firms like us, especially, related to the UK pension reform. As you suggested, it was really an insurance product and now it\u2019s migrating to much more opportunities. So the defined contribution savers will have now an option. They can take and withdraw beyond the 25% tax-free lump sum.","So we believe, this is a big opportunity for us, yeah. so especially, in light of how we think about investment outcomes and solutions. I mean retirement is something that we are spending a great deal of time trying to help savers and potential retirees in thinking about longevity and how their solutions are going to have to be more weighted towards equities, less annuitized products.","Historically, as you suggested Ken, annuitized products were the prime driver of this, and if you are going to be living a long time, earning 2% on an annuitized product for 3% you\u2019re just going to have to be saving a lot more money to earn the necessary pool of money you want. This is what we\u2019re rolling out, we rolled out CoRI overseas in the UK, we\u2019re going to continue to roll out our investment type of products to provide what I would say that solution based strategy. So we\u2019re encouraged, we think we\u2019re well positioned for these changes, and as you suggested, hopefully, we\u2019re in a good position to take share.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Craig.","Craig W. Siegenthaler \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC","Hey, Larry. Good morning, guys. First, just on Target date, can you talk about how the longer-term themes of open architecture and the adoption of passes are really progressing really both in the Target date funds in the U.S.? And I\u2019m really thinking your perspective here from both your LifePath and your GlidePath products.","Laurence D. Fink","Rob, you want to answer that.","Robert S. Kapito","Yes, I mean, look, it is the same trend on retirement. People have not saved enough for retirement and they have lived through too much volatility in both the equity and fixed income markets. So they are looking for an alternative for someone to manage the asset allocation and the process throughout their lifetime. So to us, the opportunity is to develop the tools to the technology and one that we have is called the CoRI Index, Cost of Retirement Index, of which we can manage through target date funds and LifePath funds, a better way to do the asset allocation as a person gets closer to retirement.","Do you think there is going to be incredible opportunities for us in this way because the advice and asset allocation is something that we specialize in? The models that we have specifically target retirees and manage this process throughout their life. And it\u2019s something where we see a lot of the sponsors are moving towards and, as Larry mentioned, a lot of DB and DC plans changing that have someone else to manage this asset allocation throughout their life.","So we are the inventor of the target date and LifePath products, people recognize us for that innovation and we are seeing a lot of demand across the board for that as a big opportunity for us in the future.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Dan.","Daniel T. Fannon \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Hi, I just want to talk about fixed income. I mean, can you talk about the momentum you are seeing particularly on the institutional side? Performance was flagged as improving. I just want to talk about just kind of client dialogue, kind of outlook for growth and how that compares to in the recent periods.","Laurence D. Fink","Well, having 90% of our fixed income products above their benchmarks for three years, having a lot of products that are in the top decile, if there is a conversation to be had firms are going to be talked, assess what are the possibilities? That puts us into a very good position. We\u2019re seeing very mix types of conversation across board, we continue to see large-scale pension funds derisking as they\u2019ve taken profits in equities, we\u2019re seeing a lot of pension funds looking now towards looking now towards some form of immunization as they get closer to their liability or even in some cases above their liability are using bonds as a vehicle.","But probably the most important key for us is our fixed income platform is more than just one product. It\u2019s across the board where we are seeing increased activities. We are in more dialogue today than we have ever have been in fixed income, in terms of new flows. In the unconstrained area we\u2019re just beginning to see public pension plans, migrate out of index based products into unconstrained products. So we are in some very large dialogues at this moment, we do believe one or two conversations constitute some large wins in the third quarter.","We continue to be in deep dialogue with many clients related to credit, and high yield and whether it\u2019s an insurance company who is looking and in need of some form of income to us, to assess their annuity liabilities. And we\u2019re still seeing a large scale international investors are looking to continue to invest in dollar-based assets and expressing those investments in the form of fixed income.","And so across the board we are seeing heightened interest in fixed income, even in the low interest rate environment. As I said, some of it is because they\u2019re de-risking in equities, but some of it is because they\u2019re seeing increased activity in their own business, like an insurance company. But I would say overall, probably overall theme I can say related to BlackRock\u2019s future and future activities in fixed income, having the performance that we have across our platform for our platform for five years, for three years, for one year is giving us a position where we are in dialogue with many clients worldwide.","Operator","Next question will come from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Laurence D. Fink","Good morning.","Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","So just you referenced the JV with Fidelity before. I was just curious about how much of the core ETF growth you've seen, which I believe you laid out as nearly 20% at the Investor Day. How much of that comes from the [sale of your] (ph) partnership or maybe if you could give some color on how that has helped to drive some of that really extraordinary growth?","Laurence D. Fink","Rob?","Robert S. Kapito","I don\u2019t know, we are willing to breakdown what is coming from one place for another. But I can also tell you that the growth that we expected is probably twice what we had anticipated.","Brennan Mc Hawken \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","For core series.","Robert S. Kapito","For a core series. And we have high aspirations for this, because there is a segment of the market that is really not looking for the liquidity, they\u2019re looking for the buy-and-hold. And this is a particular segment of that Fidelity actually addresses, so we have expectations of future growth for that, but we don\u2019t rely especially in that just upon one distribution segment, there are other distribution segments that also cater to the buy-and-hold segment.","That being said, there is \u2013 the other segment, which is the institutional or the trading segment, they are looking more at the liquidity of this and the access for asset allocation in their portfolios. So what we are trying to do is have products to appeal to the right segments and we'll price those appropriately and make sure the performance of those is appropriate for those particular targets.","Laurence D. Fink","I would just say also we are benefiting tremendously this year from the, and Rob said it earlier from the integration of two sales forces. And so, you asked a question related to fidelity, but we\u2019re seeing in large activities across all the independent channels from all the major distributors, and so, I would say it\u2019s pretty broad based, but our relationship with Fidelity is strong, growing and it\u2019s a very good partnership.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Michael.","Michael R. Carrier \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Larry. Larry, just a question. If I look at the growth that you guys have generated in iShares and on the retail side, it\u2019s been very consistent on retail, big improvement over the past couple years. And on the institutional side, I feel like you guys have the relationships. When I look at the solution products, the alternatives, it seems like the product offering is there, but the flows just aren\u2019t as strong as on the other channel. So is it an allocation problem? I know you mentioned some on the performance side, whether it is active equity or the (indiscernible) is just not there. But just from an outlook standpoint, do you guys feel like things are in place. so over the next two years that we kind of see the same trend that we saw on the retail side, or is there something else that\u2019s somewhat of a hindrance there?","Laurence D. Fink","You are right in suggesting \u2013 in terms of iShares, our rolling 12 months were growing 10%; in retail, our rolling 12 months is about 13% growth, and our rolling 12 months in institutional is flat. And so those are actual facts. What we\u2019re witnessing in institutional though, and if you look at our revenues are growing faster than our AUM, we are seeing a mix change. We\u2019re growing more in alts, which is lower AUM, higher fees. And importantly, we have seen some large scale clients derisking in equities, saying going into cash. A lot of that was international and so the net result is a flat type of growth rate over the last 12 months.","I\u2019ll be bold enough to say we believe we are well-positioned in institutional and that we are going to see opportunity for growth in institutional. Whether it is in fixed income, as I said earlier about all the unconstrained conversations we\u2019re having with large pension plans in the fixed income space, we continue to be driving more opportunities in alternatives, and I hope I can comment in the future that we\u2019re going to continue \u2013 we\u2019re going to start seeing opportunities in their model based equity business, because we\u2019ve had exceptional return. But we also have opportunities in the official institution business and corporate, in the DC plans and in the financial institution group. So among those different areas, we are in more dialogue today than we have been. But I am disappointed in the net results of AUM, and I\u2019m not upset at the revenue growth that we\u2019re seeing in the institutional side.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris M. Harris \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, guys. So just a quick follow-up on fixed income. You guys and others in the industry, clearly benefiting from growth in unconstrained and you\u2019ve highlighted that. I\u2019m kind of curious if you guys think investors understand, or fully understand the risks of these funds and then maybe how sticky do you think these assets will be if things get a little bit more volatile in the market?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, as things get more volatile, in other words, if you have more volatility, which probably means higher interest rates, you\u2019re going to be happier in an unconstrained product versus an intermediate duration target like a core product. So that is what clients are looking for. so they don\u2019t have a tethering to a benchmark that has no connection to their liability. And that is one of the big issues that\u2019s confronting a lot of investors. Investors are worried about those are in fixed income and if they are not in fixed income for immunization purposes, they are worried about the eventuality of higher rates. We are seeing growth in our global long\/short credit products, which have zero duration.","So do I think clients understand what they\u2019re getting into one 100%, clients were looking to immunize, they are looking for as long a duration as they possibly can have. So we\u2019re not going worse \u2013we should be clear \u2013 we\u2019re seeing movement across fixed income, we\u2019re seeing some people who are worried about being tethered to a benchmark that has no connection to a liability. They are either looking more towards liability matching in fixed income, or they\u2019re seeing a movement towards unconstrained. We\u2019re seeing some clients who remain steadfast in credit and are looking to add to credit whether it is in the form of a CLO or in the form of high yield.","There is not one single behavior but you\u2019d ask me specifically related unconstrained, I believe our investors are investing in unconstrained for a reason, for a purpose. And the dialogues that we\u2019ve had with clients year-to-date, validate my view that they understand what they\u2019re doing related to the associated risk and the volatility that you discussed, I think, would be attached the higher rates. And that is one of the reasons why people are looking to unconstrained. So obviously, they have to perform in that environment, and they\u2019re going to perform much better than a tethered core product that\u2019s tethered to a four or five-year duration.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached the allotted time for question. Mr. Fink, if you have any closing remarks.","Laurence D. Fink","No, I hope everyone has a decent summer. Hopefully, the volatility doesn't begin this summer, so we can take this summer. I just want to thank all our shareholders for your interest in our company. And I would like to thank the employees of BlackRock for a good quarter. Have a good quarter.

My name is Jamie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Meade","Thank you. This is Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2017.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. BlackRock\u2019s globally integrated technology and investment platform continues to position us as the solutions provider of choice to both retail and institutional clients. The breadth and scale of our capabilities allows us to continuously and efficiently reinvest in our investment, distribution, technology and risk management franchises in order to provide increase by its both clients and shareholders over time. As a result of that commitment to reinvest, net inflows for the last 12 months totaled $336 billion as organic growth accelerated in the second quarter.","Total quarterly flows exceeded $100 billion and were positive across client types, asset classes and investment styles highlighting the uniqueness of our diversified investment platform, which includes cash, market cap weighted index products, a spectrum of active offerings from smart beta and factors to high conviction alpha strategies, and illiquid alternatives. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were a record for BlackRock and represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 7%. Annualized organic base fee growth was 8% for the quarter and 5% for the last 12 months despite the pricing changes we have previously announced over the last 9 months. Record quarterly revenue of $3 billion was 6% up over a year ago. Operating income of $1.2 billion was also 6% higher than a year ago and earnings per share of $5.24 increased 10%.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $26 million of net investment gains, an increase from the second quarter of 2016 due to higher marks in the current quarter and the impact of our debt refinancing last quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.5%. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax run-rate for the remainder of 2017 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of additional discrete items and tax law changes that could arise during the year.","Second quarter base fees rose 7% year-over-year driven primarily by the positive impact of organic growth and market appreciation on average AUM partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange movements and certain previously announced pricing changes not reflected in last year\u2019s second quarter. While the dollar has recently given up gains versus major currencies, the impact of dollar appreciation over the last year still reduced our quarterly year-over-year base fee growth by about 1%. Sequentially, base fees were up 6% and benefited from higher securities lending revenue in the second quarter, which increased 11% driven by seasonality and higher on loan balances.","Last month at the Morgan Stanley Conference, I spoke about several exogenous factors, including divergent beta and FX that have negatively impacted our blended fee rate over the last several years and masked the benefit we have achieved from executing our differentiated growth strategy. As some of these headwinds lessened during the second quarter with emerging markets outperforming U.S. markets and the U.S. dollar weakening, our blended fee rate has stabilized and the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth should become more apparent.","Performance fees of $48 million decreased $26 million from the prior year due to weaker relative performance and long-only equity funds with annual locks in the second quarter. Technology and risk management revenue of $164 million increased 12% year-over-year driven by several clients going live on the Aladdin platform and new client wins. Market demand remains strong for our full range of products, including institutional Aladdin, Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management, provider Aladdin, iRetire and FutureAdvisor. Clients continue to seek sophisticated risk analytics, portfolio construction, and scalable distribution tools and our first three Aladdin risk for wealth management clients went live on the platform earlier in the quarter.","In line with our strategic focus on technology to enhance value and deliver innovative solutions to clients, we announced the acquisition of Cachematrix, a leading provider of financial technology that simplifies the cash management process for corporate treasury clients and the minority investment in scalable capital, one of the fastest growing digital investment managers in Europe. Together with our minority investment in iCapital, we believe BlackRock can significantly enhance the growth profile of these businesses, while simultaneously benefiting from their unique capabilities. The strong organic growth we are experiencing today is a result of the investments we have made in our business over time and we continue to invest aggressively to create more opportunity for the future.","Expense increased 6% year-over-year and 3% sequentially driven primarily by higher volume related expense as a result of higher average AUM and higher G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was up $24 million or 2% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation expense was down 2% reflecting lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter and $20 million of one-time expense associated with the repositioning of our active equity platform in the prior quarter. The accelerating shift to passive is impacting growth in our volume related expense and direct fund expense was up $29 million or 15% year-over-year primarily reflecting significant growth in our iShares franchise.","G&A expense was up $34 million or 11% year-over-year reflecting increased levels of spend to drive growth, including investments in technology and data and higher discretionary marketing and promotional spend. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by the timing of certain accruals and additional expense related to the sale of our UK defined contribution platform. Sequentially, G&A expense increased $49 million from the first quarter or 16% reflecting similar increases in technology, data and marketing spend, but also higher foreign exchange remeasurement expense in the current quarter.","Assuming stable markets and giving the timing and levels of our spend in the first half of 2017, we would anticipate planned G&A expense for the second half of 2017 to be in the range of $750 million. Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was flat year-over-year and up 130 basis points sequentially. As we have stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target, but remain committed to optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible by leveraging the benefits of our scale for both clients and shareholders.","We are also committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of First Reserve\u2019s Infrastructure Equity Funds. Larry will talk more about additional investments in innovation across the broader ecosystem to support future growth. We also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares in the second quarter and stand by previous guidance as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year.","Second quarter long-term net inflows of $94 billion were positive across client types and diversified across asset classes and investment styles. Long-term net inflows were driven by iShares, which crossed $1.5 trillion of global AUM in the quarter and continue to benefit from the accelerating global shift to fee based advisory in the wealth channel and the rapid adoption of iShares ETFs as asset allocation tools and financial instruments by professional money managers. Global iShares generated record quarterly net inflows of $74 billion representing 21% annualized organic growth with strength across our core and non-core exposures. In the nine months since we announced pricing changes to the core in October of last year, we have already recaptured over 75% of our investment through organic growth alone. iShares equity net inflows of $52 billion reflected demand for core ETFs cross both developed and the emerging market exposures and strong inflows into higher fee precision exposures and smart beta ETFs. Fixed income iShares net inflows of $21 billion were led by flows into investment grade corporate, emerging market bond and treasury funds.","Our institutional business generated $13 billion with long-term net inflows across both active and index strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $5 billion were driven by strong multi-asset and alternative inflows, partially offset by equity and fixed income outflows. Multi-asset flows were driven by our LifePath target date series which is our record net inflows of $9 billion. We also saw strength in fiduciary mandates and factors each with approximately $1 billion of net inflows, alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net inflows driven primarily by our global infrastructure franchise. Institutional index net inflows of $9 billion reflected strong flows the $17 billion into fixed income, partially offset by index equity outflows of $9 billion as several large clients made strategic asset allocation decisions during the quarter. Retail net inflows of $7 billion were positive in the U.S. and internationally led by fixed income and index equity products partially offset by outflows from multi-asset. Fixed income net inflows of $7 billion were diversified across our top performing platform and included $1 billion of inflows into unconstrained strategies as well as strong flows into municipals and total return strategies. While total multi-asset flows were once again impacted by outflows from world allocation strategies. Our multi-asset income strategy nevertheless raised another $2 billion during the quarter as investors continued to target income oriented outcomes.","BlackRock\u2019s second quarter results reflect the benefits of our ongoing commitment to continuously invest for the future, our diversification, scale and globally integrated investment in technology platform enables us to generate differentiated and more consistent organic growth in AUM and based fees resulting in long-term value creation for both clients and shareholders.","With that I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thanks Gary. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call. BlackRock\u2019s second quarter results reflect the trust our clients continue to place in our global investment and technology platform BlackRock\u2019s ability to partner with clients across our broad range of investment strategies and technology solutions and as a thought leader drove $104 billion of total net inflows in the quarter with a record $94 billion in long-term strategies which were positive across all client types, product types and investment styles. While significant cash remains on the sidelines, investors have begun to put more other assets to work and global equity markets continue to rise in the quarter underscoring a generally healthier global economy and proving that so far markets have been resilient the political shocks. Through the second quarter the S&P was up 8% year to-date reaching all-time highs and many international markets have even outperformed. At the same time while markets have started to anticipate a normalization, a policy in the environment of sustained expansion, negative yields remain a reality in some countries and expectations for a continued low yield environment persists. And while amounts of cash is still are un-invested and the ongoing risk of both economic and political disruption on the horizons, investors continue to face challenges in meeting their clients future need.","Both institutional and retail clients are looking to BlackRock for investment strategies and for Aladdin risk management and portfolio construction technology. They are also turning to BlackRock for our insights to help them understand how to navigate the investment landscape. Insurance companies are one example of clients that continued to face significant challenges in this low yield environment. Last month\u2019s leveraging BlackRock\u2019s extensive experience with the needs of insurance clients and risk modeling capabilities we launched an insurance industry risk study, we took the investment portfolios of the entire U.S. insurance industry at the individual security line item level, uploading them onto Aladdin and then cut the data in a variety of ways, the fee was taking what kinds of risk and how are they are being rewarded for that type of risk. And we brought together a group of insurance companies CEOs to talk about the results, to answer questions like what is the current opportunities set in their own individual portfolio and how should they be positioned in the event of a stressed economy or another crisis. We also showed the CEOs how their investment positions reflected versus their peers. And so as the incredible peer analysis for the CEOs, our goal was to provide them with more information to look to BlackRock to help them making strategic decisions that would ultimately drive their stakeholder returns. This is just one example BlackRock is increasingly using our technology, our scale and innovative ways to enhance the value that we can provide to our clients.","As the wealth management landscape evolves globally, our intermediary partners are accelerating their movement, their changes towards a fee-based advisory and fee-based accounts and are expected to grow by upward of $8 trillion in the U.S. over the next several years. As a result our wealth partners are placing more emphasis than ever before on portfolios not just a product, not just an individual bond or not just an individual stock. There also focused on both performance and the value that the underlying investors provide to investors and increasingly our partners are looking for access to high quality portfolio construction and digital technologies to help execute repeatable processes. In this environment BlackRock is able to provide more value to wealth management clients than ever before and in the U.S. through technology like Aladdin risk for wealth management which I will talk about in a few minutes. The reinvention of our sales model and tech enabled an advisor engagement had allowed us to partner with 25% more financial advisors this year than we did at the same point last year at no additional cost. The combination of BlackRock\u2019s differentiated technology offerings and our broad based investment platforms position us as a most sophisticated portfolio construction partner in the industry for both institutions and wealth managers.","Looking at flows for the quarter BlackRock saw $8 billion of active net flows driven by multi-asset fixed income and alternatives which contributed to strong organic base fee growth in the quarter. BlackRock is seeing increasingly strong fund raising momentum in the liquid alternatives with $9 billion in flows and commitments year-to-date with particularly strengthened infrastructure funds as the investments we have made in our platform over time are resonating with our clients. Our acquisition of First Reserve infrastructure equity funds which closed in the quarter adds a talented team with specific expertise in energy infrastructure investing and $3 billion of assets to our platform.","We now have over $16 billion of total investment and commitment infrastructure capital to manage on behalf of our clients. We also launched the UK first alternative solution fund earlier this month. The fund offers pension searching for yield, a long-term outcome oriented strategy in a single portfolio, which again leverages BlackRock\u2019s specialist teams across credit, real estate and infrastructure. We now managed $98 billion of assets across our core alternative platform and have an additional $15 billion of committed capital to invest going forward. BlackRock saw $86 billion of net inflows into iShares and index funds in the second quarter. Global iShares momentum continued with a record $74 billion of net inflows for a total of $138 billion of net inflows year-to-date.","As growth continues following our strategic investment to lower prices for clients, we generated $35 billion of inflows in iShares\u2019 core funds in the quarter. Importantly non-core iShares exposures generated over $38 billion of flows contributing to a higher organic base fee growth for the firm. The rapid growth we are seeing in iShares is increasingly due to the fact that ETFs are no longer used only as a passive allocation, but by active investors that generate alpha in their portfolios. ETF provide those investors targeting exposures without the idiosyncratic risk of any one single stock or one any single bond. Accelerating growth is also coming from the investments we are making more broadly to innovate across the entire ETF ecosystem. This is more than just a product innovation, it\u2019s innovation and distribution, it\u2019s innovation and portfolio construction, technology and ETF and portfolio construction education and in building new markets for new users, all of which foster further adaptation of ETFs worldwide.","As we deepen our partnership with clients and continue to strengthen our brand through both investment and technology offerings, global iShares market share of year-to-date flows has expanded to more than 40%. Fixed income ETFs are a great example of the area where broad ecosystem innovation is driving growth. After several years of BlackRock working with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on the mechanics of fixed income ETFs, accounting guidelines will now treat them as bonds instead of equities they will treat it as they look through treatment to the underlying assets making it much more efficient for insurers to own fixed income ETFs or their portfolios.","Another example is the new segment for ETS we recently announced changes in our iShares ETF MBB, the industry flagship mortgage-backed security ETF, to drive accelerated growth. We are evolving MBB or our mortgage backed bond ETF to become the leading financial instruments and I want to underline risk management tool for institutions to access fully funded exposures to physical mortgage pools. By lowering the price to make the fund competitive with direct investments in mortgage securities, institutions will have a more efficient a more liquid option for hedging their mortgage-backed exposures and their direct mortgage origination.","We also launched BlackRock\u2019s first self-index ETFs, two smart beta fixed-income ETFs. These new indexes are based on unique intellectual property and leveraging the best of BlackRock\u2019s analytics and modeling capabilities to achieve superior investment outcomes for clients. This illustrates one of the ways we are using our scale and technology to reduce manufacturing costs and pass along greater savings to our clients. Technology is transforming the asset management industry as that pace of technology innovation is accelerating. I have talked about BlackRock\u2019s aspirational target of 30% of our revenues being enabled by technology 5 years from now that is the vision for how I believe technology will help drive revenues and create efficiencies across BlackRock. Some of that vision will be driven by growth in Aladdin and our technology offerings, but much of it will come from using technology to drive investment performance and build better distribution capabilities ultimately delivering growth in base fees and performance fees. And in addition, I am using this target as a mechanism to get all 13,000 of BlackRock\u2019s employees to understand how technology and the utilization of technology is going to change, BlackRock is going to change our client\u2019s needs and will change the entire ecosystem in what we do.","Technology will impact all aspects of our business, the way we generate alpha, the way we build portfolios, the way we manage risk, the way we distribute solutions, the way we engage with service providers, the way we operate and even the way we source talent. Aladdin\u2019s portfolio and risk management technology continues to be in demand by institutional clients looking to invest and operate smarter and with more efficiencies. We now have nearly 200 institutional clients using Aladdin. Our investment teams are combining big data and machine learning with traditional fundamental human analysis to generate better sustainable alpha for our clients. As portfolios become increasingly complex and interconnected, we are leveraging our analytical and risk management technology to create more sophisticated and more scalable portfolio construction. Asset allocation and risk management tools for wealth management. Our first three Aladdin risk for wealth management clients are now live and they are benefiting from the Aladdin technology.","We are also providing our wealth management partners with integrated digital distribution platform, so they can reach and interact with their end investors in a more scalable, in a more repeatable way. Building on our acquisitions of FutureAdvisor, our investment in iCapital, we continue to expand our digital distribution capabilities with an acquisition of Cachematrix, and a minority investment in scalable capital. Both platforms will allow us to provide our clients with scalable technology-enabled solutions. In addition to driving growth, we are using Aladdin to drive operating efficiencies. The investments we made in our trading technology and operations have dramatically reduced the cost of our trades. We have reduced our trades by 80% over the last 5 years. This has been a huge reduction in those basic costs and is totally driven by technology. Going forward, technology-enabled scale will be increasingly important for every aspect of an asset managers business, our client service, our asset generation and operational excellence. This year, we will be spending $1 billion on technology and data and have over 3,500 employees working on technology and data-related roles.","We recently signed a 20-year lease for a new global headquarters at Hudson Yards in New York, which will be the state-of-the-art hub that is technologically advanced, environmentally sustainable and operationally resilient. Our new headquarters will epitomize our tech-centric culture and create a world-class experience for our people and our clients. As I have said many times but I made it as much as ever today, I have never seen more opportunities for BlackRock than I do today. The record growth we are seeing is a direct result of the investments we made to build our platform over time, continuing to invest in high growth areas of our business and moving into the adjacent areas to enhance the solutions we can offer to our clients both remain a critical priorities in order to drive future growth and provide increased value to both our clients and to our shareholders.","With that, let me open up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Glenn.","Glenn Schorr","Hello, there. So, I want to get a little follow-up on the Aladdin for wealth. So, we have been watching you invest in this. We turned three on this quarter. I am assuming there is not much in the way of revenue yet and it\u2019s more expense upfront. So maybe as we roll forward say over the next year or so what are we supposed to think about in terms of I am sure there is a lot of training going on behind the scenes, what kind of uptake should we expect and when do you think we will see it show up in both revenues and flows, because retail still 10% of AUM, but I like you have a lot of high hopes for this investment?","Gary Shedlin","So Glenn, it\u2019s Gary. Good morning. I think we are obviously working very hard on an active pipeline for Aladdin risk for wealth management. I think part of \u2013 but first of all it\u2019s generating revenue today. Obviously, there are long implementations as there are for any Aladdin implementation which could be as long as 12 months to 18 months where we bear more significant cost upfront as we have talked about before. But I think really the clients that we had are \u2013 we are all still learning together about all of the amazing things that we can do with these clients both from the top-down, in terms of some of the risk and compliance opportunities and then more importantly some of the other bottoms-up more specific financial advisor opportunities regarding portfolio construction and asset allocation that move from advisor on. So I think it\u2019s hard for us to basically specify any given level of revenue other than to say that we think it\u2019s going to accelerate significantly over the next couple of years both as we continue to adopt new opportunities with the existing clients and basically work through the pipeline of new opportunities going forward.","Laurence Fink","Glenn, I would very similar to institutional implementations, Aladdin for wealth management is actually even more complex, because we are in that dealing with let\u2019s say dozens of portfolio managers, ultimately Aladdin for wealth management is going to be delta to house level at the CIO level and then ultimately it will be implemented maybe depending on each firm at the individual financial advisor level. And this will allow us to have on opportunity to be at our financial advisor\u2019s desktops. So the actual implementation probably it is a little longer, because of the significance of the scale of it, but let\u2019s be clear this may become one of the great opportunities for BlackRock. We are going to continue to be driving more and more of the opportunities for Aladdin for wealth management. I see this being our transformation for our position in retail globally. And what I believe this does, it allows BlackRock to be even more important than the overall ecosystem of \u2013 in wealth management. It gives us, the Aladdin system will provide portfolio construction tools, it provides risk management, it is not a tools to sell only BlackRock products, it is a tool that enhance the wealth managers value proposition. They will be able to use other products on another firms, but we believe by having that placement in the desktop that placement and we have seen this in other areas, it gives us that that opportunity to have deeper, better dialogues. And so we look at this as one more fundamental long-term strategies for positioning. And as Gary suggested, there are revenues now, but the revenues are very [indiscernible] to how the institutional side are there are very modest and the margins are subdued during this process of implementation. And once utilized depending on how well they are utilized by the amount of financial advisors then we would expect increased utilization and through increased utilization will revenues from the platform.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Laurence Fink","Hi Ken.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. The SGA conducted a review on the mutual fund industry with some conclusions on the competitiveness of the market and on pricing, what sort of reactions have you seen from that review and how might this parallel your minority stake in scalable capital?","Gary Shedlin","Well, I think that we as all \u2013 hey Ken, it\u2019s Gary, as always you I think we obviously support a better ecosystem for investors. We think that to the extent that there is a better ecosystem that supports more transparency for investors and they feel more comfortable, they will obviously put more money to work. So I think we are obviously broadly supportive of a lot of what\u2019s in the study. We are just debriefing, in fact we are going to be going through it in more detail. But I think that everything there feels constructive. We are supportive of basically trying to inform how we do business in a more transparent manner with investors and we will be making and obviously continuing to work with the regulators to make additional comments to affect we try and optimize that going forward. But I think we feel that we are incredibly well positioned from the study to drive our business. I think the U.S. in many respects in terms of the most of the changes that\u2019s occurred here in terms of the migration to fee based planning which we think is obviously where Europe is going to go positions us incredibly well to learn and to basically effectuate that opportunity. And I think our desire to basically grow that is exactly why we looked for an opportunity like scalable capital to do it in a matter that will help us evolve with the marketplace.","Laurence Fink","Along the question with scalable capital or any digital advise it\u2019s a portal that is offering low fee products such as ETFs is going to be of greater value, we did not. We bought scalable capital on a macro base we believe in that as Gary said the U.S. experience will be similar in Europe. And so once again we are trying to take a couple steps ahead of our clients. And we are I think paying a good attention to the ecosystem changes that the regulators are evolving themselves in terms of making this a better environment for more investors. One thing I would say the key issue for Europe is over 72% of all savings is in cash in Europe. One of the great reasons why PE ratios are lower in Europe than the United States is most savers are only in cash and bank deposits. If through regulatory changes, through digital advise, through low cost alternatives, if we could provide Europeans with a better alternative that they look towards for investing overall a long horizon by being positioned there with digital technology with our iShares brand in Europe, I think we are as well positioned as any firm in the whole continent.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning everyone. To the data shows the ETFs aren\u2019t jut stealing share from mutual funds or active managers, but also from other sources like single security investors including in short retail investors, so the industry is stealing wallet share financial assets and total retail flows have actually accelerated in 2017 despite the DLO world, do you have any data or thought taking share behind this trend to help us think about how much of iShares\u2019 growth is actually coming from outside of the asset management industry?","Gary Shedlin","Well, I think you cited it quite well and I cited it in my prepared talks. We are seeing regulatory changes change the ETFs environment. We do believe we see accelerated flows, because the method to because of the movement towards the fiduciary role in the United States. We are seeing more active investors using ETFs to express their exposures which I talked about. I think that is accelerating having the insurance commissioners changing capital, having a look through treatment for fixed income ETFs is very important because insurance industry did not use ETFs because the differential in capital charges just because of the CUSIP number and now you have a look through treatment and so we believe the environment for ETFs is continuing to evolve. We believe it\u2019s continuing to grow and much of it also has to do with the ecosystem innovation. I think what we are doing in the mortgage backed area is going to have even a large opportunity for ETF growth as we can now use ETFs as a vehicle to hedge mortgage production. So I think what\u2019s going on is \u2013 and then I\u2019ll let Rob Kapito to speak up, I do believe you are seeing more utilization of ETFs from institutions and retail as a foreign exposure. In the active side, we are seeing more utilization across the board in more products and I think that\u2019s what we are starting to see that acceleration. Before Rob speaks, I just want to say one important point, index and ETF still only represent 10% of the entire equity market global capitalization. And here we are talking about a great amount of flows with $160 odd trillion global equity market capitalization we have much more opportunities for ETFs to grow not just in equities, but in fixed income. And I believe this is just the beginning. It reminds me of when Rob and I were young driving the mortgage-backed securities market in the late 70s, early 80s or for me in the late 70s, Rob. Rob, any comments?","Robert Kapito","Yes. First of all, I am younger than you, but second of all, Craig, I think it\u2019s not just stealing market share, what\u2019s obvious, where that\u2019s coming from, whether it be mutual funds or whether it become futures or others. What\u2019s exciting is new areas that are being created with the awareness of ETFs that not only can that be used for hedging vehicles, they can be used as Larry mentioned in the insurance area now with mortgage-backed securities which as you know are very expensive to buy because of prepayments and because of custodial costs. So, there is new and newer uses for ETFs every single day and that\u2019s why what we are trying to do is respond and be in front of our clients and we have to go out and discuss with them ways that they can use ETFs that they have not been able to use them before. So, I would say it\u2019s not only stealing market share, it\u2019s creating new market share which is really the big opportunity for all of us.","Gary Shedlin","One last thing I would say that\u2019s really important, historically, many institutions used derivative swaps or futures for hedging purposes and that was very obscure and nontransparent. What we are now seeing whether it\u2019s a bank, a trading desk or a bank balance sheet, an insurance company, a mortgage originator, we are now starting to see more and more utilization of ETFs, which is transparent. So, we look at this as a net positive. And when people talk about this or not taken into the context, how large derivative swap in futures have been and now \u2013 which was totally nontransparent and now all this activity is moving much more on to a transparent platform, which obviously is one of the reason why you are seeing the growth. And the other thing I would just say and Rob talked about it we are seeing more and more investors instead of buying individual stocks or individual bonds are using ETFs to get their exposures.","Christopher Meade","Their next question?","Operator","Your next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.","Brennan Hawken","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Gary Shedlin","Good morning.","Brennan Hawken","So just wanted to follow-up on Gary\u2019s comments about the fee rate, so I know that you walked through the fact that it\u2019s stable which is certainly attributed to the reversals from the divergent beta and FX as you highlighted. I am just kind of curious whether or not is it too much to expect that some of the reversal of those trends that have hindered your fee rate over the last few years could actually turn into tailwinds which might allow for the fee rate to expand or is stability the best way we should think about it? And I know that sometimes averages can cause the numbers on a quarterly basis to not necessarily reflect the whole story. So, when we think about the exit rate coming out of the quarter here, how should we think about the fee rate here tactically more in the near-term too? Thanks.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Brennan. Good question. So, again, I just want to take a step back again just back to the Morgan Stanley Conference, so we talked there about the fact that the blended fee rate over the last several years has obviously been impacted by a variety of factors that we don\u2019t control. We have talked about them as exogenous factors. We have obviously pointed to both the Virgin equity beta, dollar appreciation, but importantly also shifting client preferences towards lower risk asset classes and index strategies, especially last year where obviously we saw probably \u2013 we saw a large dispersion between our asset growth rate and our base fee growth rate and that actually has also has an impact by virtue of mix in terms of our fee rate. And I think all of those factors have really masked the benefit we have achieved from executing you know a pretty good differentiated growth strategy. The fee rate declined about 1.4 basis points from the second quarter of last year and that was a continuation of some of the things we have talked about, the impact of international market underperformance, dollar appreciation throughout last year, impact importantly of recent price cuts or what we would rather call an investment in our iShares franchise that were not reflected in last year\u2019s prior second quarter and importantly a slower rate of organic base fee growth relative to asset growth in the second half of last year. Sequentially, the fee rate has stabilized as those headwinds as you mentioned associated with divergent beta and FX have abated and should those trends continue, the impact of our accelerating organic base fee growth rate which has been about 6% year-to-date so far clearly should be more apparent over time. In my opinion know, if we can sustain organic based fee growth in excess of 5%, frankly, we have done that in 2012, \u201813, \u201814, \u201815 and year-to-date this year, last year was really the first year in the last five that we didn\u2019t do that. I am not really sure why the fee rate itself is garnering that much attention other than I understand that it\u2019s the basis of a lot of the modeling that everybody is doing, but I think right now we are feeling incredibly comfortable with the level of organic base fee growth rate that we are seeing and are paying a little less attention to the overall fee rate as long as we can generate that revenue momentum.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Gary Shedlin","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Fannon","Can you discuss the reaction from both clients and your distribution partners from the repositioning of the equity platform earlier this year and in particular maybe talk about some of the flows at the product level and if there is outflows that you anticipate that may still come as a result of those changes?","Laurence Fink","So, look we continue to believe in active management. And as clients focus more on outcomes, both the active and the index are going to play a role in portfolios to drive returns. So, we announced changes to our active equity platform in March. These changes were not effective until mid to late June. So, it\u2019s a little early to tell and see any material progress from the re-org of both flows or financial advice, but as anticipated we saw some accelerated outflows from the funds impacted by the changes, which contributed to some of the active equity outflows in the second quarter. But other of our fundamental active equity funds that were in part of the changes to the platform actually saw a slight improvement in outflows and additionally, we had a few large client redemptions from our scientific active equity. But a portion of these outflows were recaptured on our platform as certain clients moved into index strategies. So, our focus is going to be on generating strong performance, which we believe differentiates our ability to work with our clients to achieve their desired long-term outcomes to drive improvements in both the scientific and fundamental active equity funds since last year and there I have already seen some excellent performance in the quantitative side, 92% of our active \u2013 quantitative active equity and 78% of our fundamental active equity assets are above their benchmark and peer mediums for the 3-year period. And then the creation of our advantage series which is offering clients the ability to outperform and have the lowest fees, all of those are showing results and all of this I believe is part of our announcement of Monarch and the upside that we have to come. So we are very encouraged the portfolio managers are energized to be able share information across multiple platforms. We have heard very positive views from our clients because everyone is focused on figuring out how to utilize the big data that\u2019s out there to their advantage to create performance. So the rollout of it has been something that we have gotten very, very good client feedback from and I am very optimistic about it going forward.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hi, good morning everybody. So Larry I want to go back to the comment you made around $1 billion you guys are spending currently on tech and data with over 3,000 people, obviously it\u2019s been and continues to be very important growth area for you guys, but how much I guess do you guys expect that to grow over the next years and which area specifically you targeted more either on the data side or the technology side. And I guess you have just taken a step back, bigger picture, how should we think about overall margins in the tech and risk business as you guys continue to invest and scale this up over the next couple of years?","Laurence Fink","Let me let Gary answer that and I will give some color.","Gary Shedlin","So good morning Alex, so just to give a little bit of color on the people and the investment, the 3,500 rough cut people in technology and data related roles includes expected technology roles such as programmers and quant modelers, but also less obvious ones that leverage technology and data in a significant way like our iShares analytics and electronic trading teams. So as Larry basically mentioned we are thinking technology much more holistically not as a specific definition, but embracing technology to drive our overall \u2013 our overall business. We are spending about $1 billion this year to support that technology and data initiative which includes a number of things, but also includes compensation and related expenses associated with obviously those people as well as hardware, software and market data costs for the firm more broadly. I think in terms of margins, more broadly know as you know we are not really big on talking about individual margins of vertical businesses and so as we really think about incremental margins on specific products or businesses that\u2019s not an overwhelming or relevant number that we think about day-to-day. But for example to think about driving growth in iShares, as an example we are investing beyond simple product innovation, we are investing in the entire ETF ecosystem, we are investing in distribution or investing in portfolio construction, technology, we are investing in capital markets, ETF and portfolio construction. Education, we are talking about building new markets for new users. And I think there is no question the accelerating growth that we are seeing in iShares is a direct result of those investments more broadly. We are really trying to take a much more portfolio oriented approach to investing in technology and notwithstanding some of things that we are doing that go also through our P&L. You are also seeing us making a number of strategic acquisitions or other investments, sometimes they are controlled like Cachematrix and sometimes they really do get to see that the table and try to learn and help our partners evolve like scalable capital and high capital. I think the important thing is that whichever direction we are going to go, we are going to continue use our scale which we think is a huge driver of our ability to efficiently spend on technology in ways that others can\u2019t really to drive that growth and increased market share for both shareholders and our clients.","Laurence Fink","Alex, I would argue in every industry in the world today technology will be changing how we operate, how our clients operate and if we are not aggressively trying to be providing technology to interface with our clients better, technology to create more efficiencies as we operate and technology as we think about how to get better insights we will be \u2013 we will not provide the information and the ideas to our clients. And I believe we need to be driving this faster. And I do believe as I said for quarter and quarter and quarter I believe through this relentless investments we are able to secure deeper, broader relationships with more clients worldwide. I think Aladdin for wealth management is going to allow us to have a much better position going forward with all our distribution partners and helping them to think about the risk for their own clients so they do a better job with their clients. And the key for all of us worldwide if our clients have better outcomes as I talked about Europe and the amount of cash if we can provide better outcomes and better risk information so people look to investing more for the long-term, we will all be better off. And I believe this is an important responsibility and role for BlackRock to use technology to enhance financial literacy [Technical Difficulty] financial literacy to our financial advisors and ultimately financial \u2013 and allowing that technology allow our financial advisors provide better literacy to their clients. And this is something that is we are very aggressive on and I do believe the relentless pace that we have related towards technology puts us in a differentiated position than any other asset manager and we will continue to try to drive technology to make us different.","Operator","Your next question is from William Katz with Citigroup.","Laurence Fink","Hey Bill.","William Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. And this is actually feeds on what you guys are sort of talking about, as you think about the margin, I was trying to look back to your last Analyst Day, it seemed like the formula was some revenue growth, some operating leverage and you get some sort of mid-teens earnings growth on top of that with low capital management, is there a shift here just to more of a top line focus and maybe a little bit more flattening the margin opportunity on a go forward basis and within that, the $750 million [ph] mentioned to sort of second half of planned G&A, could you talk about, is that sort of like the new run rate as you look ahead given the relentless drive to grow the business? Thank you.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks Bill. Good morning to you. So look, as we have said in the past week we really don\u2019t manage the business to a specific margin target. And in my view, my personal view quarterly comparisons here are less relevant and you really should look at our performance over a more appropriate period of time especially in the context of the organic growth that we are generating today. Our commitment has not changed. Our commitment has always been to optimize organic growth in the most efficient way possible especially by leveraging our scale for both clients and shareholders. And I think if you look back over the work that we have done since BGI, in particular the operating margin is up well over 500 basis points and we have invested significantly back into the business. We are currently generating record organic growth, especially in terms of base fees. As I mentioned over the last 12 months $335 million plus of net new business, that\u2019s 7% organic AUM growth and importantly 5% organic base fee growth. It was a significant time where people were asking us when we were going to get to those levels. And well, I think it\u2019s still early to call it\u2019s sustainable for a significant period of time. This level of growth is clearly a direct result of the investments that we have made over time. No one likes higher margins than I do or well, maybe the guy sitting next to me actually does, but I also know that our level of organic growth determines our multiple and continuing to invest to support these record levels of organic growth is a critical priority for us and one that will be maintained going forward. While there is obviously an upward bias to our margin as we continue to grow in a constructive environment, I think as Larry indicated in his in his remarks, we intend to continue playing offense by aggressively investing to create more opportunities for future growth.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","I just want to thank everybody for joining us this morning, for your interest in BlackRock. Our second quarter results once again highlights our long-term investments we made to enhance and differentiate BlackRock, it is differentiated because our global investment platform is differentiated because of our global technology platform. We will continue to invest in both our technology and investment capabilities and use our scale to deliver better outcomes for our clients and shareholders. And we are going to use that scale to provide better financial literacy and better long-term results on behalf of our clients which will enable them to invest in more financial assets, we and the whole industry will be better off. We believe we have a good start in doing that and we believe we have deeper, stronger relationship with more clients worldwide than we ever had before, which I believe will lead to future growth for the firm and for our shareholders. Everyone have a very good quarter. And we will talk to you soon.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3341":["BlackRock, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Inc. Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. This is Matt Mallow, and I'm General Counsel of BlackRock. Before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me point out that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements, and we call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements. As you all are aware, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today on the call. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I will get out of the way and let the call begin. Gary?","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present our second quarter results for the first time as CFO of BlackRock. Today, I'll provide some opening comments on our financial performance and also reference selected pages from our earnings supplement, which has been posted on the BlackRock Investor Relations website. I'll be discussing primarily as-adjusted results. These results exclude, among other items, the financial impact of a significant Charitable Contribution in the second quarter, which I will review in more detail shortly. Finally, I'll outline some changes we've made to our earnings release to improve transparency and facilitate a better understanding of the drivers of our business.","As I discussed at Investor Day a few weeks ago, we're focused on 3 key drivers of shareholder value: organic growth, operating leverage and capital management. Despite some market volatility over the last 6 weeks of the quarter, we delivered on each of these drivers, resulting in a strong quarter and continued earnings growth. We generated second quarter earnings per share of $4.15, up 34% compared to 2012. Operating income was $982 million, 18% higher than a year ago, reflecting record base fees in the quarter and continued margin improvement. Non-operating results reflected a $22 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, as well as a $39 million noncash pretax gain relating to the PennyMac IPO, which we disclosed in our first quarter 10-Q. The second quarter as-adjusted tax rate was 27.3%. During the quarter, we benefited from a number of discrete tax items totaling approximately $29 million, which were primarily attributable to the realization of loss carryforwards. For planning purposes, we continue to believe that 31% is an appropriate run rate based on what we know today.","Underpinning our results was continued organic growth, which we achieved despite a challenging market. In the second quarter, we generated approximately $12 billion of net new long-term flows. As Larry will discuss in more detail, these flows continued to demonstrate the diversity of our multi-client platform as our retail and institutional channels drove our organic growth this quarter, offsetting the outflows experienced in our iShares business during the month of June.","Despite the fact that organic growth for the quarter was below our stated target, we've generated approximately $130 billion of adjusted net new long-term business over the past 12 months, representing a 4% organic growth rate. Because 83% of these net flows were generated by our retail and iShares channels, our organic revenue growth was even higher, as these channels have higher effective fee rates compared to the firm's overall average fee rate.","As you can see on Page 10 in the supplement, second quarter revenues were $2.48 billion, up $253 million or 11% from a year ago. Base fees reached record levels on the back of historically strong markets and organic growth. We experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all traditional long-dated asset classes.","In the second quarter, we continued to experience strong performance across a number of our single strategy hedge funds, contributing to a significant year-over-year increase in performance fees. Lower performance fees versus the first quarter were a result of seasonal factors. Given recent market volatility and the majority of funds that lock in the second half of the year, we will continue to update you on performance throughout the year.","Our BlackRock Solutions franchise continued to benefit from robust activity. Revenues in the second quarter were $138 million, up $7 million compared to 2012. Our Aladdin business benefited from continued trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and clients seeking multi-asset risk solutions, while our FMA business saw momentum from ongoing regulatory change, especially in Europe. The Aladdin pipeline remains strong, especially driven by demand from asset managers. And while year-over-year results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain fees, we continue to expect mid-teens growth rates for the business. Securities lending revenue grew 21% versus the first quarter led by seasonal demand, but declined on a year-over-year basis as a result of spread compression.","Turning to Page 12 of the supplement. Expenses were up $103 million year-over-year driven primarily by revenue-related items, including direct fund expense and compensation. This was a 7% increase from a year ago compared to an 11% increase in revenue over the same period, and resulted in an operating margin of 41.3%, 210 basis points higher from a year ago.","We continue to believe that scale is a critically -- is critically important to our business, and we see scale advantages in a number of areas: growing our passive business, leveraging our brand spend, offsetting technology cost to our Aladdin business and absorbing the increased cost of regulation and compliance. In particular, as we indicated last quarter, we'll continue to invest in our brand, especially when there is an opportunity to deliver important messages at a time when messages will have the most meaningful impact. As such, we increased our brand spend in the second quarter to levels more consistent with the year-ago quarter. We still expect our full-year brand investment to be in line with 2012 levels.","Our margin has recently benefited from positive mix shift and rising global market levels. However, in the last 6 weeks of the quarter, we witnessed outflows in certain high-margin products and the decline in market levels. As we emphasized during Investor Day, we remain committed to dual objectives: running the firm as efficiently as possible, while also investing for future growth. While our margin will fluctuate as a function of mix shift and data, we remain confident that we can maintain minimum margins of 40% and stable market conditions.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value with the first priority to invest in our business. In May, we announced the acquisition of MGPA, a private equity real estate investment advisory company. This deal will double the size of our real estate advisory business and extend its reach to Asia Pac and EMEA. The acquisition will not be material to earnings per share and is expected to close in the third quarter, subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.","Though not included in the current quarter, on July 1, we completed the acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse's ETF business with assets under management of $16 billion. This acquisition will extend our footprint in the Swiss market and bring a broader range of opportunities to Swiss investors through our iShares platforms, while also adding an array of complementary products to serve our clients across Europe.","Our capital management policy remains consistent. We repurchased approximately $250 million of shares in the second quarter, matching the value of shares we repurchased in the first quarter. As we have previously stated in the current environment, we would expect to continue this level of repurchase for the remainder of the year.","Before I turn it over to Larry, I want to address the impact of PennyMac on our quarter results and some changes to our earnings release. Between 2008 and 2012, BlackRock made a series of investment in PennyMac, a leading national mortgage lender and servicer. In May, PennyMac completed an initial public offering. BlackRock was not a seller in the IPO. However, as a result of the IPO, we recorded a noncash, non-operating pretax gain of $39 million related to the carrying value of our equity method investment, which is included in our as-adjusted results.","As Larry will discuss more fully, subsequent to the IPO in June, BlackRock made a Charitable Contribution of approximately 6 million units of our PennyMac investment to a new Donor Advised Fund. The fair value of this contribution was $124 million and is included in G&A expense on our GAAP income statement. In connection with the Charitable Contribution, we also recognized an additional noncash, non-operating gain of $80 million, and recorded a net tax benefit of $57 million. Among other items, the financial impact of the entire Charitable Contribution has been excluded from as-adjusted results. Page 28 of the earnings supplement details the financial impact of both the PennyMac IPO and related Charitable Contribution. Going forward, BlackRock will continue to account for our remaining 20% PennyMac holding as an equity method investment.","Finally, as some of you may have noticed, we have made some changes to our earnings release. Given the diverse nature of our multi-client platform, we feel that our AUM inflows are best viewed and analyzed through a comprehensive lense. With that in mind, we have added incremented AUM disclosures by client and product in order to provide greater transparency on our business drivers, including the addition of average AUM data based on relative month-end averages. Given this additional disclosure, we have also decided to discontinue the reporting of our net new business institutional pipeline. This decision is not meant to signal any change in the outlook for our institutional business. In fact, our pipeline at July 11 was $49.3 billion, up $13.9 billion from April 11, with a mix of business largely in line with prior quarters. We trust these changes will facilitate a better understanding of our overall business.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Gary, and thanks for joining, everyone -- us today on this call. But before we start, I'd like to reiterate how excited I am to have Gary on board. He's been a close partner of mine and adviser to BlackRock for many years, and it's great to have him as a full-time member of our team.","Let me begin with a little market context. What started out as a relatively steady first 2 months of the quarter for markets took a turn in late May following a series of global events, all within a concentrated period of time. The Fed's comments on May 22, suggesting a change in narrative, a change in the idea of tapering their bond purchasing program led to markets aggressively selling off to the long end of the curve. What we witnessed to see also is a rapid sell-off from leveraged investment products. The same time, growing uncertainty surrounding Japanese policy makers going all-in on our stimulus efforts, triggered approximately a 20% 3-week sell-off in the Nikkei after a very large run-up. And finally, continuing market worries about Chinese growth and emerging market capital flows sparked a downturn in emerging markets. These events drove a material uptick in market volatility, and we saw different types of investor react in different ways, highlighting the stability of BlackRock's multi-client platform. In fact, we saw very little in the ways of changes from our largest institutional clients as we remain committed to their long-term investment objectives.","We did see a market change in trading-oriented investor behavior, particularly with respect to long-duration fixed income and emerging market equity exposure, as those clients used liquidity in our iShares products to reposition their portfolios. Many of these macro and policy concerns that attracted attention in the markets remain, along with the ongoing political uncertainty of the Middle East, are likely to continue to drive global capital market volatility. However, I remain just as constructive on a long-term upside of the U.S. equities as I have been over the last 2 years.","We've spoken frequently about the benefits of our diversified business model at BlackRock, and we saw strong evidence of that again this quarter. Generated record long-term base fees of $2.1 billion and long-term net inflows of approximately $12 billion, taking our flows to $51.4 billion year-to-date. We benefited from the diversity of the client segments we serve, the diversity of our product set and the diversity of the geographies in which we operate.","During the quarter, we had 11 funds across retail, and iShares generated more than $1 billion in flows. These funds did not include our traditional growth engines, Global Al and Equity Dividend, which I believe showcases BlackRock's highly scalable product breadth, which -- with representation across all major classes, client segments and importantly, geographies.","In recent quarters, iShares delivered a substantial portion of BlackRock's overall organic growth. This quarter, it was our Retail and Institutional businesses driving growth and offsetting iShares' outflows. Positive net flows in the quarter were led by multi-asset products, unconstrained fixed income and retail alternatives, 3 key areas of focus where we've been investing to building market-leading position. Our flows also reflect the benefit of our broad platform and BlackRock's global reach, with positive contributions from both our active and passive franchises and strong flows in our EMEA and Asia Pacific regions.","Before I walk through the results, I'd like to take a minute to discuss the macro trend that has been a key driver of flows at BlackRock, and I think will continue to drive BlackRock's upcoming quarters. This is about the growth -- Great Rotation. The Great Rotation in equities has been much discussed. We are seeing a rotation at BlackRock, but it's not from fixed income into equities, it's a rotation within fixed income. Over the past several quarters, we've been warning our clients about the asymmetric risk in their fixed income portfolios. The 30-year bull market, which I was witnessing through my career, in fixed income products has meant that more than a generation of investors had never seen the losses in their fixed income portfolios.","In the past few months, obviously, that's started to change. 10-year yield spiked more than 100 basis points from the lows of early May through the first week of July, and the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index fell nearly 5% during the same period.","There is a Great Rotation. We believe, it's going to be out of core Barclays Aggregate-type products, the types of products that have been benefiting from duration extension in the past but are now sources of increased risk. We expect to see flows moving into more flexible, nontraditional fixed income products. Industry flows into flexible bond products across the industry has increased sevenfold year-to-date versus the same period last year, while flows in more traditional bond categories has fallen as great as 80%.","We built BlackRock on our reputation in fixed income. We let that performance get away from us in 2008. And we spent a great deal of time on rebuilding that -- the performance platform at BlackRock. And we fixed the business over the past few years, and I'm proud to say that we're well positioned today in fixed income space, more than we've ever been, and we're now ahead of most of our competitors.","As of the end of June, we're outperforming in a number of key fixed income areas. We've seen strong recent outperformance in our Total Return Fund, which is a top decile for the 1-year period, and should prove to have a better defensive position relative to our peers. Our Low Duration Bond Fund is a top quartile for a 3-year period of time is in the sweet spot for yield-starved investors searching for some strong performance with minimum duration risk. And perhaps, most importantly, our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunity fund, or SIO, is in the top quartile for 1- and 3-year period. SIO is designed to provide yield, capital return and downside protection in diverse interest rate environments. They took in more than $1.6 billion in the quarter, now has -- for $6 billion in assets. We're very encouraged by the retail adoption of this product. As we introduced the fund outside the U.S. and to institutional investors, SIO is well positioned to be one of BlackRock's largest and most important products in the coming years.","So across the board, we're well positioned to benefit from the changes in fixed income. We've developed strong offerings across unconstrained, across floating rate, alternatives and multi-asset categories. For example, this quarter, we launched the Asia Floating Rate Income Fund, which is designed to protect against rising rates, and we saw more than $300 million inflows. In the alternative space, we saw $1.1 billion of U.S. retail flows in our Global Long\/Short Credit Mutual Fund, a product designed to eliminate interest rate risk and provide credit-driven solutions. Our Multi-Asset Income Fund, or MIA -- MAI, has been a strong fixed income substitute. It's 5-star, go-anywhere income solution that continues to see strong momentum, taking in more than $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter.","As investors begin to more fully appreciate the risk in their fixed income portfolios, we have the solutions our clients need, we're well positioned to reap the benefits of the rotation within fixed income. The types of outcome-oriented solutions I just discussed have been a key driver in our retail and institutional client businesses, which generated healthy flows despite the challenging investment landscape.","In retail, our diversified platform continues to deliver result. This quarter, we generated $5.1 billion in net inflows, with key themes of income, alternatives and outcome-oriented solutions, driving positive results across all geographies. U.S. retail and high net worth had long-term net inflows in the second quarter of $3.5 billion. I just mentioned SIO, MAI and our Global Long\/Short Credit Fund, all which netted north of $1 billion in net flows in the quarter. Alternatives are rapidly moving into the mainstream as the funds we launched in the past 2 years have more than $2.5 billion in AUM, having raised $1.1 billion in our second quarter. During the quarter, we also launched the Emerging Market Allocation Fund, an innovative actively managed product, leveraging our 12 separate emerging market teams that create product breadth that few, if any, of our competitors can match.","International retail, we saw long-term net inflows of $1.6 billion, reflecting global consistency in targeted growth areas, including strong multi-asset, fixed income and alternative flows. Multi-asset net inflows demonstrated increasing interest in our Global Allocation, Managed Volatility and Dynamic Asset Allocation offerings, as retail investors look for us, at BlackRock, to provide them solutions to address the market volatility.","Let me turn to fundamental equities. It still is a mixed story. However, we're pleased with the strong start we're starting to -- we're seeing in some of our new managers in U.S., fundamental equities and across the board. And our Basic Value Fund, a great example of the turnaround, over 275 basis points of outperformance in the past 6 months.","Our European equities continue to strengthen, led by our top-decile performing -- performance across a number of our funds, including our euro market fund, offset by outflows and our natural resources where we had a dominant position and remain to be dominant, but where we're seeing outflows in commodity-like type products. And we saw outflows in our U.K. equities.","What I'm particularly pleased -- being set up when we see a refreshed inflows, and that is in our Emerging Market equities. One of our new managers, has been with us close to 2 years now, is Andrew Swan, who continues to outperform, beating his benchmark by more than 300 basis points year-to-date.","Our Global Allocation fund, which has performed very, very well while managing risk exposure, for the last rolling 12 months, it earned over a 12% return to our investors.","Let me turn to institutional, where we generated $7.8 billion in long-term net new business. Flows are driven largely by a combination of continued shift to passive and demand for multi-asset solutions. The tone of our conversation with institutional clients remained positive, as evidenced by clients adding to positions amidst all this market volatility. This also speaks very loudly how our clients are looking for BlackRock for helping them to provide solutions. And in that sense, we are seeing bar belling that continues to be a dominant theme, with large, strategic clients investing in both equity and fixed income index mandates alongside alternative solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns.","Institutional active products saw positive flows for the first time in 8 quarters, with $1.3 billion in net inflows. Strong multi-asset flows offset fundamental equities and active currency challenges. We benefited from our proactive plan dialogue around regulatory changes, as implementation of RDR-like regulation in Europe drove a large, highly customized multi-asset strategy, an advisory win for the quarter.","We expect to see more types of opportunity working alongside our distribution partners as they try to respond to RDR, and we believe we will see more sub-advisory type of relationships as that continues.","Once again, our key growth subsegments, specifically defined contributions and official institutions, continue to be strong contributors. We generated $4 billion in our target date LifePath product in the quarter, with now nets over $7 billion in new flows. We also saw more than $6 billion of flows from official institutions, primarily into path of equity mandates.","We continue to evaluate ways to connect our products and clients for the overlay of risk management through BlackRock Solutions at our Aladdin platform. Our Aladdin business continues to grow with multiple successful implementations and an expanding client base, much of which is in global in nature. As Gary mentioned, we continue to expect mid-teen revenue growth in our Aladdin business. We signed a record number of advisory assignments in Q2, and we continue to see opportunities to have clients use Aladdin, especially now with the new regulatory environment we're all living in.","We also announced that during the quarter, the alliance with MarketAxess, which will allow our clients to tap into a deeper liquidity pool for U.S. credit from the Aladdin platform. We remain well positioned across BlackRock Solutions and our financial advisory business continues to showcase the differentiated and strong multi-client platform.","We were recently retained in 2 new assignments that speak to our unique analytical capabilities. The first is the assignment on behalf of Her Majesty's Treasury to provide advice on Royal Bank of Scotland; and the second is a significant country-wide banking diagnostics. We are proud to be a trusted adviser for global leaders when they face -- faced with issues involving significant financial complexities. And we also work very closely with all the regulators related to the implementation in terms of new focuses on risk management leverage ratios. And we believe with this greater and greater scrutiny, more and more clients are going to be looking for Aladdin as a source of risk management tools.","Now let me turn to iShares. As what Mark Wiedman, who runs our iShares business, told you at Investor Day, iShares are used in both as an investment vehicle, but also it's used as an exposure tool by our clients. Amidst market volatility in June, we saw clients again turn to iShares to express their views, in this case, on emerging markets and long-duration fixed income.","In the 3 weeks following May 22, clients redeemed nearly $15 billion in iShares. The ability to exit quickly, the ability to exit efficiently and in bulk, is part and parcel of our value proposition to an important client segment, a trading-oriented investors. These investors prefer iShares as the broadest, most liquid suite of ETFs. They use iShares when they want to take on fresh risk, as they did earlier in the year and the fourth quarter of 2012, and when they want to exit, as they did following the Fed comments on tapering.","The consequences is that our quarterly flows and our flow market share will be volatile. Since quarter end, the flows have reversed, with more than $6 billion of inflows through yesterday and more than $30 billion of net flows year-to-date. In fact, despite the volatility we saw in June, we are running at the same rate of growth as we did last year, as last year, we saw a summer swoon in our ETF market. So we love our position in our business and we expect this as the same type of future.","But importantly, we look to longer horizons. Over quarters and years, our market share of assets have been stable, and in 2012, for instance, we grew in line with a global industry with 27% AUM growth and a 14% organic growth. The flows in the second quarter reflect the fact that iShares delivered the liquid market exposure that our clients' expect. This is true even in the products that experienced the most selling pressure, including emerging market equities and fixed income ETFs. EEM, our flagship emerging market fund, traded a record $5 billion in a day, all in the secondary market without any creations or redemptions. Similarly, for the first time, we saw a $1 billion plus trading [ph] day in our leading U.S. corporate ETF like HYG and LQD.","So overall, our product performed in a challenging period, but we welcome continued dialogue around the mechanics of ETFs. We are constantly working with market makers and exchanges to ensure that ETFs are working appropriately. As the market leader in the industry, we believe we have a responsibility to lead the charge on market practices and investor education, not just with respect to iShares but in the ETF market globally at large.","Turning to the business results for global iShares, we ended the quarter with $1 billion in net inflows. We've seen a healthy start in the third quarter with $6.2 billion in net inflows through July 16. iShares base fees of $723 million represents a 21% year-over-year increase. Fixed income outflows was $1.5 billion, driven a rotation out of the long-duration fixed income. We also experienced outflows in our commodity-like products of $2.2 billion, in line with the macro pressures in that segment.","Equity net inflows in our ETF products was $2.7 billion, showcasing the breadth of our offerings, as outflows in emerging market products were offset across the franchise. A key driver in our new flows was our minimum volatility equity suite where we saw -- launched a new marketing campaign during the quarter. This set of products offers investors equity exposure with flatter peaks and valleys. It's an innovative solution that we developed in-house, and we raised more than $7.6 billion since the launch of this product only 2 years ago.","Let me just also add, regionally, iShares results were supported by strength in Europe and Latin America, offsetting the weakness I talked about in the United States. EMEA iShares retained its leading position with $2.5 billion in net inflows. Flows were led by equities with $2.2 billion in net inflows. We actually had our 25th consecutive month of positive ETF fixed income flows in India.","Overall, we remain very pleased with the direction of our iShares business. However, we must remain aggressive in pursuing new opportunities through both product innovation and tapping into new market segments. Let me give you 3 examples. First, we launched -- we recently launched our fixed income iSharesBonds series targeted towards traditional fixed income investors. Second, we launched our Core Series products, which we designed for the buy and hold segment, and we delivered $3.6 billion of net positive flows in the quarter. And third, last quarter, we announced our long-term strategic alliance with Fidelity to provide access to iShares in the self-directed segment. And that partnership is off to a great, great start.","In summary, iShares provide solutions both for investors focused on liquidity and those looking to build long-term portfolios using beta products. We believe that we continue to be in a secular bull market for ETFs, and that as a market leader, we will both drive the growth and benefit from the growth of the market.","I'll wrap up my comments with a few other significant events that occurred during the quarter. Our brand campaign continues to drive increased awareness and recognition, and we backed that up with targeted marketing towards our key investor segments and products. We're helping our clients to answer the question to what to do with their money, and we're focusing their attention on the solutions they need to be successful in the current investing environment. We're also trying to remind our clients that their objectives is, in most cases, about retirement. And the noise we saw in the last 6 weeks truly has little consequences in terms of their long-term objective needs. And as I said earlier, we have not seen investor behavior change by what I call our traditional long-term clients. And I think our ad campaign is helping our clients understand that we need to be focused not on the noise of the day but on the objectives over a long cycle.","As Gary discussed, during the quarter, we used a portion of our ownership stake in PennyMac to fund a philanthropic entity by seeding the Donor Advised Fund. As a leader in our community, as a leader in the industry, we're committed to be -- to the well-being of our communities where we live and work. This new charitable initiative will deepen our commitment to public responsibility that has always been fundamental to our business. We expect the fund to be operational in early 2014 and it will be a cornerstone of BlackRock's philanthropic efforts, including, among other things, helping to promote financial education for low-income families and individuals. I'd like to personally congratulate and thank Stan Kurland and the entire PennyMac team for the work they've done in building that business and creating value that will benefit BlackRock shareholders for the years to come.","Finally, in June, we hosted our Inaugural Investor Day. Our goal was to provide more exposure to the depth and talent of our team and provide a deeper dive into the growth prospects for the firm. I've been fortunate to be surrounded by a talented and dedicated global team for many years, and that team is a key driver of our performance and growth. As a result, as this quarter shows, even in periods of volatility, we have a platform designed to deliver for both clients and shareholders.","We are well positioned to benefit from long-term market trends, including the rotation within fixed income space with our unconstrained alternatives and multi-asset offerings, as well as a continued shift to passive in the use of beta products to generate alpha with our iShares business. We will continue to strive to stay ahead of secular changes and put our clients in a position to meet their investment goals. We have an exciting opportunity in front of us to execute on the growth plan we laid out a few weeks ago. I believe that growth plan is intact, and I believe we will continue to drive the types of rates we discussed in much more detail during Investor Day. I would like to thank everybody in all the hard work for all the employees.","And with that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Larry, just one question on the fixed income business. You gave a lot of detail. Just in terms of BlackRock, how you guys are setup from a fixed income product mix, what's your offering when you look at the mix of, say, like the core products versus the -- what you characterize as either the alternative or the flex products? And then also just from like a fee perspective. If we continue to see more of that shift over time, what tends to be the fee rate in those products versus some of the more core products?","Laurence Douglas Fink","On the unconstrained type of product, the margins are -- or the fees are higher than our core products, but I won't say dramatically higher. And as we see more and more growth in that, obviously, we'll look to change that. But right now, the fees are higher than our core products. And as I said for the -- our 1- and 3-year period of time after fees, we've outperformed our peers in that. So that's one positive thing. We're going to have a lot of clients who are not going to be able to move out of core. And we still -- we have great performance in our core offerings also. It is my view that more clients should be moving more towards more the unconstrained type of products, and I do believe you're going to see more and more investors move in that. Let me just also add, 2\/3 of our fixed income assets are held by institutional clients, and they're generally slower in terms of movement. But I do believe that the dialogues we're having, more and more institutional clients are asking the question, how should they be looking at their fixed income portfolio. As I said in my prepared speeches, we had a 30-year bull market, people were very accustomed and very convinced that having their assets in a core product was a foundational component of their fixed income allocation. I think that is being -- that will change over time. I think we'll be a big beneficiary of that change. But as I said, institutions are slow to adapt. They have to work with the consultants, and I don't mean that in a negative way. They take -- they have to act as a fiduciary, making sure they're -- they need to make sure they're meeting the needs as a fiduciary. But importantly also, many of our fixed income investors, whether they're insurance companies or other types of organization, they are looking to match their assets to their liabilities. And so a lot of fixed income investing is liability-based investing. And those types of investors, you're not -- they're going to be -- they're not unhappy with rising rates if their liabilities are moving alongside with that. So that's why we're here to say there's going to be a rotation, but it -- and it could be large in some segments of fixed income owners and in some segments, it is going to be much less.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you mentioned some of the volatility in May and June and how the ETFs performed. Just on the fixed income side, you mentioned the relationship with MarketAxess, you guys announced something with TradeWeb. Just during that same period of time in May and June, just given the regulations, dealers holding less inventory, any insight in terms of, as a big fixed income player, how the markets performed? And based on those relationships, what you guys are trying to do longer term?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Sure. That's not related to iShares. I mean, but one thing is very clear, that people are using -- I think one of the big trends that I think even surprise me, many investors use iShares in fixed income for beta exposure. Sometimes some investors used to use some form of derivatives and swaps and other forms of options, now they're using ETFs. So that's one of the things that was designed. There was no question during, I guess, those few moments during late June. There were periods of pretty poor liquidity in the fixed income markets, especially in credit. I'm not particularly alarmed about this. I think the Street has done a very good job to try to manage their balance sheet issues, managing their leverage ratio issues, managing their capital issues. We, as long-term investors, are going to have to deal with this. This is why, I believe, more and more fixed income will be traded on electronic platforms in the coming years, and I think we'll find a new source of liquidity. But in the short run, there are bouts of illiquidity, that's the entire market. And I just want to underscore the cash part of the market, the ETF component of the market, I mean, we saw periods of time of illiquidity. But as I reflect now in less -- in more calm periods today, what I'm particularly surprised at how well the exchanges and the market participants of fixed income ETFs performed. As I said, we saw $1 billion of flows in one day, the creates and redeems worked very well. There was periods of time during the day where there were appearances of discounts, but all that was, was a indication of where the cash market was going. And obviously, there is many cases in which, in global bonds, where markets were closed overseas and the ETF market from that close looked like a discount, but it was really telegraphing where the markets were going to go the next morning. And so we were -- I mean, we were very pleased with how they performed. Nevertheless, as the market leader, we are doing whatever we can to assure as great a market liquidity as possible. It is our responsibility to educate and to inform to making sure that we have a more liquid market. But the overall fixed income market is going through this evolutionary change now as Wall Street is relying less on balance sheet, spending much more time on flow. They're dealing -- they're developing their own electronic trading platforms, MarketAxess is another one. And as long-term investors, this is something we're all going to have to live with and adapt.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just following up on fixed income allocations from institutions, just in terms of going from maybe core to non-core products, how are fixed income ETFs playing into those discussions? And just following on, on some of the discussions around the -- what sounds like sort of market dislocations, if you will, that were temporary versus sort of tracking our long-term for fixed income. Maybe you could talk about sort of the market share opportunity?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Mark Wiedman's here, and he's going to be able to answer that question in a lot more granularity than I can. So Mark, why don't you answer that?","Mark K. Wiedman","Marc, there are 2 things, I think, implicit in your question. Let me address them separately. The first is about growing adoption by what I would call fixed income specialists of fixed income ETFs. So historically, the users of fixed income ETFs have been wealth managers and asset allocators. I call them generalist investors. And that's where the bulk even today of our fixed income ETF holdings are. What's the big transformation that's occurring is we're seeing fixed income specialists who control, I don't know, 98%, 99% of the global fixed income assets, actually starting to use fixed income ETFs in their portfolios. For liquidity purposes, they're using them for tactical positioning. It's our aspiration with the iSharesBond launch that we actually penetrate beyond the tactical position into longer buy-and-hold segments, whether they'd be an insurance, or bank, or corporate balance sheet, or individuals around the world. So that's the broad trend, and we see it every day. It gets a bit masked when you see people flowing out of an asset class because it looks like they're exiting the ETF. What they're doing is using the ETF, and again, those tactical traders, for the exact purpose for which they bought it, which is the ability to get out quickly when they want to. The second question you're addressing is the -- I think, Larry used the appearance, I think that's the right word of a gap between the underlying and the ETF price. And I think the issue here is volatility you can see versus volatility you can't. What ETFs do is they shine a light on intraday volatility in the underlying asset class, the cash market, the underlying securities. And so an optical gap can open up in the short term versus net asset value, which is the industry convention by which, for example, even ETFs report the value. But it's important to understand that's because the NAV depends on historical pricing. It's a disciplined conservative tool for valuing securities at the last known transaction price. The problem is in fast-moving markets, those prices go stale. So if you're talking about, let's take the example of overnight equities, emerging market equities or Japanese equities, for example. The ETFs will keep repricing based on news during the day. And we've seen this historically in 2011 after the nuclear disaster in Japan, we saw it recently with the sell-off in Japan, that our leading ETFs for Japan, EWJ, keeps trading as if it's a continuous market with the Nikkei in Tokyo. So that's the first part. The second thing is on the bonds, is understand that the prices in the NAV are recorded at historical last transaction. What that means is that, for example, in our high-yield ETF, the leading one, HYG, 30% of the underlying securities are priced at a security -- at NAVs 3 months or more old, 30% of those prices are 3 months or more old. That's the industry convention, it's how we price our ETFs for disciplined conservative valuation practices. But it creates optical illusions versus the underlying cash markets, because there are securities in which there actually just haven't been transactions. So that's the basic issue. We believe our securities have performed -- actually, our ETFs in particularly high-yield and emerging market performed better than they ever have. And that's why our clients are actually happy to be using them and that's why we're happy to be -- that's our key takeaway.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you can just give some color on your EM -- on active EM business both in equity and debt. Obviously, we saw -- we've seen a pretty good bout of volatility here. Are you sensing or seeing from your clients any change in thinking about being active in EM versus passive in their allocations toward EM?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No, I think that those are who are -- a core group of our investors believe that active management EM is part of their core philosophy, and this is why we've been so aggressive in building our EM fixed income team and our EM equity team. And EM and also, as I suggested, our EM alternatives. What we did, we have a $500 million win in our EM fixed income team. This is on the active side. As I talked about Andrew Swan in terms of his outperformance in a component of that. But there are another core group of investors, and some of them, official institutions. They're investing in EM principally through a beta product. And so our job, as I've said for many quarters, is to provide an active solution and a beta solution. But Marc, I have not seen any dramatic shift out of beta into active or vice versa. I think those who are -- who believe in active will continue to invest in active, and those who believe in -- who want exposure and they're not as concerned about excess performance they're going to go into beta.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just, Larry, on the active equity business, the flow trends, they look like they decelerate or improved sequentially a little bit. How much of the improvement is sort of redemptions slowing versus wins in active equity? Are you seeing sort of the end of the bout of redemptions, or is it gross sales are picking up or...","Laurence Douglas Fink","I think a lot of the redemptions are the component of when we transition our managers, we expect large outflows. And so some of -- so obviously, that's behind us. Our investors are starting to see the positive turnaround. We have probably more dialogue than ever before. Some of our trends, we are seeing continued flows in European equities where we have a 5-, 3- and 1-year track record that's in top quartile. And so we're -- so some of it is a combination of both. But the other thing that we're seeing -- we continue to see more and more interest in multi-assets where clients are looking for equity exposure but in a more of a multi-asset type of strategy where you could navigate around. So -- and the other thing is it's undeniable, our scientific active equity team has had great results. I expected to start seeing more inflows, but we're not seeing any outflows as you suggested. So I think it's fair to say our -- the outflow drag is probably behind us, and now it's opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Quick question, just going back to the capital management, really on the debt side. I'm just curious, how are you thinking about managing kind of the debt side of the ledger? I mean, I think you had around $750 million of some notes that matured. I mean, should we expect that the objective is to kind of chip away at outstanding debt over time as part of the capital management strategy?","Gary S. Shedlin","Rob, it's Gary. So our next maturity is in December, so we're basically a little more than a year away from that, and that's about $1 billion. So we're obviously monitoring. There's the constant tradeoff -- I'd say there's 2 trade-offs. One is basically trying to basically get a feel for, obviously, where we think rates are going to go and spreads over the next 16 months, so we're going to be very mindful of that. But we're also mindful of the negative carry. So we're going to try and balance base -- both of those items in terms of trying to have an outlook and understand the negative carry. But we're certainly not going to play that too cute. So whether it's next month or it's 6 to 8 months from now, that remains to be seen based on our continued analysis, but we're very mindful of it.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know you don't -- you guys didn't provide the balance sheet, but -- and I could be mistaken. I guess, I thought you may have some floating rate notes that matured back in April or May, and I'm just kind of curious how you...","Gary S. Shedlin","Those were pre-refinanced last year at the time of the Barclays buyback.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Another follow-up question on Aladdin. Just want to make sure I understand how some of the new business flows. You talked about having pretty strong pipeline and expecting double-digit growth there. Am I right in assuming that there's some upfront costs as you bring on those mandates so that maybe it takes a while for profitability on the new mandates to flow through in that. With that, and given the strong growth you've had there in the last couple of years, should we really be expecting maybe some acceleration over the coming year or so in the Aladdin's growth?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, as we said, both Gary and I said, we expect double-digit revenue growth. Obviously, it's lumpier. So over course of the year, we expect that. We've signed 5 new mandates in the first quarter and 5 new mandates in the second quarter. We have never seen this type of volume. And we are about to sign one of the largest mandates we've ever had. As I said, more and more institutions are looking to take on Aladdin as their risk management solution. And this is asset managers, this is official institutions, insurance companies, and so we continue to see huge upside and opportunity to build Aladdin. We crossed about another $14 trillion mark in terms of assets that we are now analyzing risk on behalf of our clients. It continues to be an industry leader. And I believe as an industry leader, because of the increased regulatory issues that we all have to face, having a risk system that is across product, that encapsulates regional issues, regional differences, compliance issues, it allows investors, especially the more regulated investors, to deal with the regulatory compliance in a far better way that they would have otherwise. Especially in Europe, as you have each country now adapting regulatory issues a little differently. And so the regulatory issues that we are all facing, BlackRock included, is enormous. And if we did not have at BlackRock -- I'm going to speak for ourselves for a second, if we did not have a monoline platform of risk management, risk understanding, a monoline platform of -- in terms of trade entry, trade discovery, inventory management, we would have far more difficulties. And I think one of the reasons why we continue to have better than industry average in margins has been because of having this technology in face of all the regulatory added needs that we have to face. Our competitors who are asset managers, obviously, have the same issues. They are now becoming our clients. They are faced the same issues, and they're trying to achieve the same type of simplicity and operating structure that we have at BlackRock, and we're happy to make them our clients.","Gary S. Shedlin","And Rob, I would just add, just specifically that the year-over-year comparison in terms of it being up 5%, I think was your question, is definitely the result of timing and recognition of renewals and implementation fees. So there's no question there's some timing issues in there. And to Larry's point on the pipeline, I'd say the one really very good piece of news is while we're adding -- we added 5 clients in the first quarter and 5 new clients in the second quarter, the run rate of revenues for that group of clients is increasing fairly dramatically. And in fact, in the pipeline, as Larry mentioned, the run rate of those new clients is even greater than the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In terms of the money market forum [ph], you didn't really talk -- you touched on it. I know you covered it at the Analyst Day recently, but there's been a little bit more movement maybe by the IRS, and I'm just curious, what's been the feedback from your client base as they've had a chance to ruminate a little bit on some of the proposed change by the SEC, and what might be the behavior around any of these changes?","Laurence Douglas Fink","As I said during the Investor Day, I don't think we're going to see that much change. I think this has been so well telegraphed. If we get the IRS changes as you suggested, we need to deal well with [ph] changes. That's something that's going to be very important. So if we get these changes, which I think are coming forth, we have been working very closely with the regulators. As they finalize this, they've asked for our input as they've asked for other people's input. We've been -- we're providing input to the regulators from input that we have had from our clients. As I said, this is so well telegraphed. We're going to have some clients who are going to have to move probably close -- more to the government-oriented funds because they require some form of guarantee, some sort of backstop, or they -- and they have to have a constant NAV. Some clients are going to be able to adapt to have a floating NAV. And the reality is, Bill, because we publish every day, now, what our NAV is, it really has almost like a implied floating NAV even today. And as our clients are watching, all the clients that are in money market funds are saying how the NAV is staying much more constant. The industry has done a very good job of self-policing itself. And so I think much of this is already in the marketplace. One last thing, we have the final comment letter is due in September. And as I've said, we're getting feedback and we're providing that feedback to the regulators from our clients. But as I said Investor Day, I'm very calm about this.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then a quick question for Gary. I heard you on the $250 million is a good run rate in terms of repurchased. But with the stock trading where it's at right now and your earnings building, how are you thinking about that on a go-forward basis? And I guess the real question is, as you think about the share count, should we expect that to continue to migrate lower, or will that start to stabilize at this point?","Gary S. Shedlin","I think we're obviously going to continue to try and be as consistent and predictable in terms of our capital management policy, Bill, as we possibly can. As I said, the run rate for the moment, I think we feel very comfortable with the $250 million a quarter. We're going to try and be really systematic about that as opposed to overwhelmingly opportunistic. And so with that, I would expect for, basically, the second, the third and fourth quarter, you'll expect the share count to come down and obviously, generally kind of gets offset in the first quarter of the year based on employee comp issuance. But overall, you're going to see that count continue to come down.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. I -- we have not discussed this with our board. This is a discussion that we would have probably in our later board meetings. But it's very clear that as long as we generate the free cash flow that we are generating, Bill, which obviously will grow as we grow earnings, it would be my expectation the board would authorize us to continue with the process of reducing our share count. But I mean, obviously, that's subject to conversation. And we do have board authorization for, what? 7 million, 8 million more shares outstanding right now. But right now, our board has agreed to the current rate that we are purchasing right now. But just pay attention to our free cash flow, and we don't need to discuss anymore.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Just one point of clarification. The $6 billion that you've got on iShares quarter-to-date, did you provide dynamics to where that's coming into in terms of products? I'm sorry, I might have missed that.","Laurence Douglas Fink","No, we did not. I mean, it's all public data. Mark, why don't you just quickly answer that.","Mark K. Wiedman","It's broadly distributed, I can -- I don't have off-hand the numbers for Core Series by assets. The -- into where they come, but we see -- I give you one example of how the Core Series is achieving its purpose relative to more high velocity trading vehicles. We launched IEMG, which is our low-cost broad EM exposure vehicle. Lower liquidity doesn't have the derivatives ecology of its big sister EEM. IEMG launched in October. It's nearing $2 billion. That money kept flowing in even during massive outflows out of EEM. And what that shows is, there's 2 different segments: there are consistent buyers coming in a trickle, and then you see other buyers or -- and sellers who are moving in and out much faster. So I would say, look at the Core Series for a long-term investment trend, so we can get you that data, it's out there, public. And then for -- you look for more fast money as products like EEM and HYG.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line with Matt Kelley with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just 2 quick ones for me. So I'd just be curious to get your comments on the demand for allocation funds from -- segmented into institutional and retail demand. So as you think about financial advisers and you think about institutions, where is kind of the increase or decrease at the margin and pickup in demand? And how your EM allocation fund is fitting in within that so far as well?","Laurence Douglas Fink","You mean the EM [ph] allocation fund part that we announced -- that we discussed? So where we see clients looking for BlackRock to do the allocation, these are generally fiduciary mandates where we are working alongside with them and we are working with them, and we're seeing a rise in fiduciary types of businesses. But I mean, principally, these allocation types of products are retail-oriented products. That's what they're designed for, or that's where we're seeing, in the RIA channel and other channels where clients are looking to have these types of products. In Global Al, obviously, that's a very large scale retail product and it's expanding now in their RIA channel in itself. And so one should not expect large-scale institutional monies moving into these type of products. But for those clients who are looking for investor decisions as a fiduciary, that will be -- continue to be a larger business of ours. In fact, in this week's P&I, there's a whole article about fiduciary business, talking about how that's a growth area in the investment management business. So that's where we're going to continue to see that. And the other area where we see it, Matt, is in our Defined contribution and our LifePath business, where, as I said earlier, we had another $4 billion of growth, $7 billion over the quarter. And this is where we are taking that investment decision or allocation process.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, I saw some news out that BlackRock's considering the launch of a Swiss fund range. So I'm just -- I'm curious and I know that's something you guys touched on in the Swiss market at your Investor Day. So when you think about that, how have you -- what have you set up and what do you still need to set up? Are all the pieces in place, now it's just about kind of execution and distribution?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Mark, I mean...","Mark K. Wiedman","I think what you're referring to is we acquired the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF platform. That gave us a platform in Switzerland. The primary rationale for that was they're offering Swiss ETFs to Swiss buyers who, for tax reasons, can't by UCITS funds. But it's important to understand that gives us a foundation which we will be building on for offering a broader Swiss complement beyond just ETFs in Switzerland.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just to follow up on that. I was actually referring to the broader launch. I'm not sure if that's something you guys can kind of comment on.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, in Switzerland, we continue -- we're a big believer in Switzerland. We believe whether it's in Swiss francs, whether it's specifically the investment management platform that we have in Switzerland, our -- I think you're referring to, our Swiss country manager spoke about launching of some Swiss-oriented product, Swiss-based, and that's just a continuation of our desire to build a stronger presence in Switzerland.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First on sort of Barclays AGG versus unconstrained, how much capacity do you think there is in this unconstrained market? It seems very intuitive that you'd see the switch from core to alternative. But I guess, is there enough supply to absorb this meaningful potential demand?","Laurence Douglas Fink","From my perspective, the investment process is no different than managing an Agg. Obviously, it requires more flexibility, a lot more technology, making sure you're managing to the level of risk that you want to take. But there are many competitors in this product. JPMorgan has a great product. PIMCO has a product, our product, so I believe the capacity in the industry is in the trillions. I think this is going to be a very large component of the future bond market, and I look to the key participants to be a big player in it. We just -- we happened, as you've noted in your research report, we have really great 1- and 3-year performance, and we continue to drive great performance in this area and we're continuing to see accelerated flows in these products.","Kenneth B. Worthington - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then 2Q, I think you opened your prepared remarks, saw 2 very to different markets. April and May was very different than June. And I think it was mentioned that the tone with many clients has not changed. But I assume with some clients, it has changed. I'd say, maybe first, with which clients have the conversation or the tone changed, and what actions do you expect them to take because of the change in rates, particularly on the unintuitive side? You mentioned like Barclays AGG to unconstrained. But I guess, are there other areas where you're seeing leading indicators for change, whether it'd be like dividend stocks or real estate or FX products by retail or institutional. So any other things worth highlighting there outside of the unconstrained versus Barclays Agg?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, I think when we see these shifts in attitude, when you see 100-basis-point movements in rates, you certainly have an accelerated dialogue with your clients. So even our most deliberative clients who are looking at long-term solutions, they require a lot of hand holding also, and they ask many questions. But overall, as I've said, institutionally, we did not see much behavior change. As I've said and reiterated, the dialogue we're having related to movement out of core products into unconstrained is one consistent dialogue. But I would say 2 or 3 more trends that we had with our clients. One is, we continue to see more questions related to bar belling. The volatility remind clients -- it frightens clients, that markets can move very rapidly, very violently. So bar belling becomes a bigger component of what the clients are asking. They're looking -- as a result of that, we have not seen any slowdown in the use of index products or beta products. We are also seeing more and more clients looking for more uncorrelated type of products, equity, fixed income and other types of products. So some of our alternative products, we have a lot dialogue in that. But the key there, I think, is every time you have these bouts, clients have to relook at how much illiquidity they can afford. And so one of the key things that I think clients -- why they're moving towards more beta products is these bouts of illiquidity frighten them, and you just have more structural liquidity in index-based products. And that trend has not changed. The other thing that -- but on the same side, as the indication of the bar belling, we have more than $3 billion of illiquid commitments in our pipeline. So we continue to see the same type of behavior. But the need for hand holding, the need to talk about long-term solutions became more and more apparent during these bouts of illiquidity and during the great change in rates and the psychology of rates. But we have not seen much behavior change in dividend stocks. I think globally, you still continue to see -- you didn't see any real outflows in dividend stocks as the industry. I think there are great example of showing less beta. They certainly show less beta on the upside and they showed less beta downside during the market setback, and now we're back to almost close to the highs again. Ken, the key for us is to provide consistency in our messaging to our clients. And as I said, our hand holding has to be consistent and we have to -- we have to talk to our clients above the noise. Now in ETFs, I think Mark and his team had -- because Mark and his team deals with a lot of clients who are more in a component of the iShares, it's more of the fast-trading people. His team had to have very different dialogues. So it really -- once again, it speaks loudly of the diversity of our clients at BlackRock, but the core institutional clients' behavior didn't change. Obviously, we saw a lot of hand-holding need in retail. And probably, the greatest hand-holding needs were in the iShares area where we saw the extreme volatility, where people were using these products for beta exposure. And in the case of June, it was negative beta exposure, not positive beta exposure. That's okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You've touched a lot of already on the ongoing debate about whether ETFs help or hurt liquidity during times stress. I think particularly with an asset class like fixed income where underlying OTC liquidity is thin and getting thinner. If I could ask you to be as objective as possible, to what extent would you acknowledge that we're in unchartered territory? This is an open question. And do you think that naysayers make any good points, and what could go wrong here that would damage the reputation of ETF vehicle in the mind of investors, and what keeps you up at night?","Laurence Douglas Fink","This is a great question. I'm going to listen to Mark first and I'll give my response after.","Mark K. Wiedman","I think that I would say the first thing is we have learned we have a lot more work to do in educating clients and other stakeholders about how these vehicles behave, what does the current market price actually represent versus, as I mentioned, the asset values and the like. So a lot of work in educating people how the tools work. The good news is the clients who use the tools are very happy with how they actually perform. So that's the good news. But there's a lot of work in educating a very broad group of people, including clients, about how the actual vehicles work. I think one of the things that I think is underlying is that expectations of market liquidity and ETFs require a little bit of clarification. The minimum liquidity of an ETF is the underlying liquidity of the asset class less arbitrage cost. That's the minimum liquidity. So if the underlying is illiquid, the ETF itself also might be illiquid. But some ETFs create additional secondary liquidity, which Larry mentioned, aggregate [ph] EEM, for example, $5 billion. We see it everyday with our Russell 2000 product, IWM, which trades huge sums every day, which you can never trade in the underlying. So there's additional liquidity creation. Those are the kinds of -- that distinction there, I think it's important for people to understand, so if you're trading in a obscure asset class like some Yemeni securities, you should expect that the ETF will also be illiquid.","Laurence Douglas Fink","We don't trade in those.","Matthew J. Mallow","We don't trade in those. Not yet. Basically that ETF will also be illiquid. It doesn't, by just becoming an ETF, have magical liquidity. I think that key distinction is the number one thing we need to get out there in the marketplace for people to properly understand how these vehicles are supposed to perform.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I would just add, the markets -- there's heightened scrutiny of ETFs right now, which I actually believe is a good thing. There is no question during the moments of stress, there was heightened inquiry related to the flows and the quality of the markets of ETFs. We welcome this type of scrutiny. It's this type of scrutiny that, in my mind, helps us strengthen the market for the future. I am not here to suggest I don't lose sleep over our commitments in the ETF market. It is a large commitment. We have a lot of responsibility for the fluidity of this market, for the success of this market. And I don't take that responsibility lightly, and I know Mark and his team does not take that responsibility lightly. We believe the potential ETFs, as we stated in some of BlackRock research, would be greater than $2 trillion. We believe this will continue to grow. And so that responsibility is only greater to assure that this market performs as we describe. And as Mark suggested, it requires a lot of education. And that -- and education can go only so far. But we need to make sure that our regulators are updated continuously, we have to make sure that all our competitors are taking that fiduciary responsibility as importantly as we do, we need to make sure that the quality of the products can withstand the test of time, the test of bouts of illiquidity and the test of time of variances of the markets. If we can achieve that, the trends that we see by investor behavior, the ETF market will be more than $2 trillion, which is a great opportunity for the entire market. Mark is now telling me $5 trillion.","Mark K. Wiedman","Yes, we're at $2 trillion now globally. We're going to $5 trillion.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Excuse me, I knew where the $2 trillion came from, but up to $5 trillion. And so there's a great opportunity to continue to build that. And as I've said, from our viewpoint, despite the noise, the ETF market performed very well, especially when you consider the underlying illiquidity. And it's so important to note, and I have to reiterate it, because I think that point was not understood. The fact that we were able to trade $5 billion at EEM without creating or redeeming, adds $5 billion of market liquidity. So you didn't have to put $5 billion of stocks into the marketplace. And I think that's a very important component of these products. And I should also remind people, when you have, at the end of the day, big inflows or outflows of mutual funds, you don't have that recreate and redeem, that then results, if there's redeems, that then creates outflows and stock pressure. So let's not think of iShares or ETFs as something very different. It's just flowing 24\/7 or during the market time opening, whereas in the mutual fund side, it's at the end of the day. I'm just trying to say, the markets are very similar, one's just more transparent. But having the ability to do that creates and redeem through the market makers is a very powerful differentiating feature.","I think that's the last of the questions, operator, is that correct?","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. As I've said repeatedly, what makes me very proud in leading this firm is the diversification of our platform, our multi-client platform having multi-products, global distribution, risk management. In times where we saw big outflows in one business, we saw big inflows in another business, really illuminates how this platform has been built and really allows us to be a very differentiated player in the world of investing. Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your patience. Thank you for all the time you've given us today. Have a good quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock, Incorporated Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President; Robert S. Kapito, and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Christopher J. Meade","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty, and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, let's begin.","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.","Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double-digits and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty is causing clients to defer investment decisions resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows, and a shift from equity to fixed income assets.","This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important, as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than in any time in our history, and we are well-positioned for growth when client activity accelerates.","Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share.","During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis.","Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78, was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund related investments. Our as adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6%, compared to 30.1% a year ago.","We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective \u2013 the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring items that could arise during the year. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates.","Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion representing 3% organic growth. Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change favoring lower fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of diversion equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets linked to our higher fee equity products including emerging markets, Europe, Asia, natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines.","Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well-positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform.","Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally, and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund related and certain long only equity products.","BlackRock solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizeable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients to date, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months.","As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently.","Total expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3% driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million or 3% year-over-year reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter.","Distribution and servicing costs increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, and reduced money market fund fee waivers which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate.","As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. Our second quarter as adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially primarily reflecting marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees and their respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline.","As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders, and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business, and then returning excess cash to shareholders.","In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform.","Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas including fixed income ETFs, smart beta and factor products, and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income inflows of $10 billion. We continued to see investor appetite for risk aware smart beta products, with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the number one market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the Core Series, which is less sensitive to the macro environment raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares at their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility, and express rapidly changing investment views.","Since the UK's decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks, as clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry, as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macro economic events.","The global retail market is changing dramatically. DOL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating, and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry, domestic, and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued offer performance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform including active and passive investment products, solutions, and portfolio construction tools, and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment.","Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client reallocation activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter, and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest.","In the United States, our defined contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients.","As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients, and drive long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, it has also led to a more and deeper conversation with our clients than ever before.","They are seeking our advice; they are looking for our investment solutions and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned, I mean, we BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need.","Political and macroeconomic uncertainty including Brexit, the upcoming elections in France and the United States, historically low yields and elevated market volatility, regulatory pressure including the DOL, Solvency II, these factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause, as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them.","Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models work in a zero yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth, and individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return, as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plans.","Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields, yet central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multi-year period, and are seeking record out flows \u2013 or seeing record outflows.","The blanket beta strategy that worked so well post-crisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level. Today, as the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing, and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager.","Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China, and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside, and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs. And we, BlackRock, are doing that.","As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients, and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute, our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I am confident that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows.","Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF, or an unconstrained fixed income strategy, or a smart beta or factor strategy, or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others. But most important is our ability to fashion solutions, from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology. And that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients.","As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well-diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively, and we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business.","Since quarter end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows thus far in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the number one share of global and European ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months.","For some of you, you may remember more than five years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today with a fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class.","And just as we were doing five years ago, today we\u2019re investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors, and smart beta, and also critically in technology, from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there is significant need for our global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield.","We are well-positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected. You need scale. You have to leverage technology, and of course, you have to be smart and nimble.","BlackRock\u2019s Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhance that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. Our data expertise allows us to turn large, unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risk and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risk and opportunities.","The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry\u2019s top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved, with 80% in fixed income, 67% in fundamental equity, 82% in scientific active equity above their benchmark for peer medium for the last three year period. We\u2019re making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter.","Factor-based investment strategy it helps us bridge the gap between traditional active and index, and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad, persistent drivers of return through low cost efficient vehicles. During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion leading the ETF industry smart beta category, and BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies.","Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition, and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those that do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients\u2019 long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business, to enhance our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies, and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform.","Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter. We saw one of the largest clients \u2013 we\u2019ve signed one of the largest clients to date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhance capabilities, to meet clients\u2019 current and future needs. As we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem, we are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through provider Aladdin, and providing wealth management organizations with institutional quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin for wealth platform.","We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape including the new DOL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform, as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger term impact of global events.","The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII hosted two client calls the morning after the vote, with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock\u2019s position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted advisor.","Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We\u2019ll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients, and we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward.","Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they are coming to us and asking us for advice. As I\u2019ve said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients needs. That is why I have never seen in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today.","Now let\u2019s open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Carrier","Hi, Larry, how are you doing?","Laurence D. Fink","Good.","Michael Carrier","Larry, just a first question, I think everyone \u2013 when you look at BlackRock, and you look at all of the products that you guys offer and you\u2019ve proven it over time, in terms of the organic growth that you\u2019re able to generate. So this quarter, it\u2019s a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all of the cash on the sidelines, yet you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you are talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there\u2019s still enough \u2013 I don\u2019t know conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?","Laurence D. Fink","Sure. Well, first and foremost, clients want to put money to work. They\u2019re pausing, that\u2019s certainly true. I think we\u2019re seeing an anomaly right now. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably are institutional. Because at the same time, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking at the data, there\u2019s still outflows in mutual funds which tells you, obviously retail are still selling, but that the divergence is quite stark, and shocking to see that type of differential.","The dialogues we\u2019re having with clients are, as I said as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work. The issue is some clients who have regulatory issues for capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, it gets it more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so, I believe we\u2019re going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can\u2019t predict whether it\u2019s the third quarter, but I\u2019m particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public so I could talk about it.","And the dialogue we\u2019re having institutional and we\u2019ve seen good flows in, and awards in alternatives already this quarter.","So it is not as \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic depending on the clients needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before, as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it? And so, Michael, I can\u2019t predict one quarter over another. But what I can say, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand, and I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can\u2019t say that about the industry though.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Laurence D. Fink","All right, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning, Larry. With rates now at zero, and actually more like negative across a decent, out of the spectrum, I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for alternatives, infrastructure, et cetera. What\u2019s your thought on that? When are we going to see some more of this money move, and how is BlackRock positioned for that?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, I think we\u2019ve been consistent in saying we\u2019re continuing to grow our illiquid alts business. I said, just from the last question, we have been awarded one or two mandates already this quarter in the alt space. I think across the board, we\u2019re well-positioned. It really depends on what category. You mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis in this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it\u2019s very easy to find the capital.","So as you know, we have a $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion in fund to funds of private equity. We continue to see growth in private credit. We\u2019re well-positioned in some of these products. Other products, we are not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alt space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as \u2013 in some of the platforms, we\u2019re not as strong, because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we\u2019ve been building it.","We did a \u2013 we have an institutional client survey. And in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real assets. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so, we believe we\u2019re in a very good position for it. I would argue though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they have done poorly in the alternative space is, because there\u2019s so much money chasing this, so few investments.","Gary S. Shedlin","Craig, just recall that when you look at the numbers that you see, it\u2019s a little complicated, because remember we\u2019ve got commitments coming in, that don\u2019t impact on net new business for the quarter. But we have return of capital going out that does impact our net new business for the quarter. So on a \u2013 if we kind of normalize for that, in terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB we did see NMV before return-of-capital of about $825 million, let\u2019s call it $825 million again infrastructure pep in BAA that Larry mentioned.","And we also did institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter. Again infrastructure opportunistic credit, NBAA that I think was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of uninvested, but committed capital. As you know, we\u2019ll hit NNB as the assets go in the ground.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hey, Larry. Good morning. So I was hoping to zone in a little bit more on the active fixed income business for you guys. I guess, A, just a little bit of color around the reallocation you highlighted in the second quarter, where there was a kind of one-off event. And then, just broadly given the negative yield dynamic that you burned off earlier, was just hoping you could comment on your unconstrained bond platform? Because it sounds like that\u2019s the product that could solve some of the issues? And the uptick has been good, but perhaps a little bit slower the last couple of quarters. So maybe you can comment on that as well? Thanks.","Laurence D. Fink","Rob, why don\u2019t you \u2013 ?","Robert S. Kapito","Yes, so let me give you a little bit of a deeper dive on the fixed income results for the quarter. So clients continue to search for a yield in a low rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained the critical component of most client\u2019s portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise, with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the three year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPs.","The fixed income ETF industry recently reached by the way, $600 billion in total AUM. And that\u2019s doubled over the past four years, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper, just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows. And that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF.","So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it\u2019s led by total return, and it\u2019s also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income. And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia-Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities. The reason being, giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk, but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that area of the market is going to continue to grow, as well as from the iShares fixed income side.","Operator","Your next question is from Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Bill Katz","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just to switch gears a little bit. Big picture Larry, I guess, there\u2019s been some talk coming out of DC, about some building liquidity constraints, or requirements for mutual funds. I was wondering what you could share with us, or maybe what you\u2019re hearing, and what the implications might be across the business, if any?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, I don't know much more. As we said in the last quarter, we are supportive of rules that enhanced investor protection. We are highly enthusiastic with roles that give more confidence to investors that they believe at a level playing field so they could invest. And if we can see that confidence build and unlock some of this huge cash holdings, we're in a very good position. So I want to put that into context of what is being proposed. We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed, the disclosures related to liquidity, we know in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at, different buckets how you analyze and risks they are going to set a limit to, the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules and we believe there is a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios.","As you know, we have been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risks and importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DOL rule that I believe some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interests and having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology for Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that Bill but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC and we hope that we have that transparency in all the funds and understanding so people \u2013 investors can understand what are the embedded liquidity risks in these funds and we don't know how they are going to respond to the differentiation between a mutual fund and ETF or how they look at them differently. So we don't know enough and we will wait and see when they come out with a final common period, final proposal for another common period.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Berg with RBC Capital Markets.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Eric.","Eric Berg","Thanks so much. Good morning. Given that there has been a decline in the quarter or a decline in the retail business but the iShare business in terms of your last 12 months organic growth remains as strong as ever. Is it possible here that what we're seeing is less a slowdown in the \u2013 in investor interest and more just a continued shifting of investor interest, not a slowdown in retail investor interest but just a continued shifting of investor preference from active to the iShares?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, I think that that is a trend, that is a trend, but I think it's more than that. I think it is as I said, I think some of the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces \u2013 if people are looking for exposures, they can go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace \u2013 like we do agree with the notion of what BWC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow, and maybe double in size. I think the big thing Eric, maybe a bigger issue is, we're seeing a redefinement of active. ","As you heard, we're making our investments \u2013 our investments are our smart beta which is a form of active, it's not \u2013 we call it tethered active but it is a form of active. We are talking about using factors as analysis and our minimum volatility ETF is a great way of getting Active \u2013 some form of active returns through a ETF platform. So I think its technology using different instruments like ETFs. Like more importantly, I think preferences are changing so the old way of investing maybe just as in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing. And so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive. ","I am a big believer that active will play a role in the future, so let's be clear about it. We believe whether it is \u2013 alternative is an active product. We are a big believer that and in some categories like in Asian equities and components and European equities and in some areas in the U.S. equity market where active returns can and shall outperform it's over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks. ","That's one thing that I think \u2013 and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that the dynamics that are changing, we are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks, and I think probably the most \u2013 more than I want to just allude to, obviously the last four months we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities, I would not write it off over a long cycle and I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. ","We had eight quarters in a row of positive flows. And so, I'm not \u2013 I don't know if this is a beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products, and we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next five years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning, Larry.","Laurence D. Fink","Hey, how are you? Good morning.","Robert Lee","Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 go back to the DOL rule and a couple of things around that. I guess the first thing is, I mean it is \u2013 even though it's just kind of announced, it is a relatively short implementation or goes effective in next April which means I guess distributors have to decide soon how they're going to deal with it and what that means for you guys. So the first thing is, is there \u2013 do you have any better sense of how not so much in terms of more iShares demand but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers, in particular? How does distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DOL world? And then maybe related to that, you did develop the Aladdin for Wealth Platform or adopted the Aladdin platform for the Wealth market; kind of curious to any update on how you're seeing the uptake on that or potential uptake on that platform in the Wealth Management market?","Laurence D. Fink","So \u2013 really good question. I don't' have much better insight than probably you do at the moment. We are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe the DOL will be revolutionary for their business and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said it in our first quarter results that once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry.","Two, I think it's most certainly as you raise the question related to Aladdin for Wealth; most certainly I think the DOL and the responsibilities under the DOL, it's going to need a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogues with everybody on the uptake of Aladdin for Wealth, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say but I will say we are in very deep dialogue, and I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for Wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DOL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser to act in a fiduciary way. There is a big dialogue \u2013 as we know that DOL is only about retirement assets, the big dialogue is does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business that could be debated among different people.","So I don't know what it means as outcome. I think the positive side \u2013 so I'm taking this in the long run a positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have \u2013 they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of the client asset as a fiduciary. But I do believe that they are going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have almost more like the European model where you have CIOs who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know because we talked about the European experience now for at least eight years and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DOL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move for those that are appropriate work to a advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those client that have that advisory relationship it builds a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner, and their advisor. And I believe because our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo.","Chris Harris","Hey, Larry. I want to come back to the interest rate discussion for a second. We know money-market funds have been waiving fees for some time now just because rates are so low. If medium- to long-term interest rates continue to decline, might bond funds have to start doing similar things? And if they might have to, are we getting close to having to worry about this risk?","Laurence D. Fink","Well, if anything, we've had it in that 25 basis point increase in the United States, so actually money market funds in many cases are in a better position today than they were a year ago. You're seeing, as you suggested, a flattening of the yield curve. I actually don't believe, I mean, we saw the 10 year go down to as low as what, 1.35%, and we're at 1.47% right now at I last looked, 1.46%. The two year note is still trading at 66 basis points, or approximately around that area. If the U.S. goes down that path, and we're reversing that increase, and indeed the Federal Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole different issue. ","I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. I believe the U.S. economy is growing \u2013 not as well as we want it to be, but I think we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell \u2013 and we still have plus or minus, a 5% unemployment rate in this country. So despite all of the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see at this time, a Federal Reserve that turns itself into a central bank that has to aggressively ease. And so, it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easing mode. I think the actions of the Bank of England today is another good example. Marketplace anticipated an easing. They suggested in their commentary, that they are going to possibly ease in August, and looking for more data. ","So if the UK growth rate does fall like we at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around. And I would tell you very clearly, the U.S. economy is still, the area where people want to invest worldwide. And I don't see that \u2013 I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States any time soon. I think we're going to live in this environment of low rate for a long time though.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.","Laurence D. Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Cyprys","Hey, good morning. Just a question on the illiquid strategies, an area of growth that you guys have been flagging here. Can you talk a little bit more about the private credit space, how you're building out that part of the business, and do you feel that you have all the pieces and parts, or would you look to buy anything? And then, if you could just also touch upon some of the demand trends that you see, especially in light of this low rate environment?","Laurence D. Fink","Yes, so the private credit business is really one that is very customized, and very specific to the institutional investor, that is looking to find uncorrelated investments in the marketplace that you'd say are a little outside of the box. And we put together a very, very strong team, that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit, and using all of the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see, we never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities.","So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients, that while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns, and they are not correlated at all with various parts of the market to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here, are north of $1 billion type mandates.","The struggle for many institutions in this, is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities, we just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this, and we\u2019re very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we\u2019re sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they\u2019re looking for.","And I might add, one of the things that we\u2019re going to have Mark Wiseman when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets. Because at his previous job, he is one of the guys that\u2019s in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source, and find these type of investments outside of the box. So they\u2019re very customized, long-term, very large mandates that require a significant team, significant resources. And we have it, and we\u2019re very optimistic on this in the future.","Operator","And we have reached our allotted time for questions, and I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Fink for any closing remarks.","Laurence D. Fink","Well, I really truly want to just say thank you for joining us, and your continued interest in BlackRock. I can promise you, we will continue to evolve our business to enhance the differentiating platform of BlackRock\u2019s diverse and global platform. I could also proudly tell you, that our dialogue with our clients have never been deeper, more robust, and when those opportunities prevail, we will be a component of their future allocations.","Our relentless focus on always improving the Firm will drive that future growth, and we\u2019ll continue to create that long-term value for you as our shareholders, and I believe we\u2019re in a good position to do that. With that, have a good quarter. Hopefully, it will be a little less volatile in, the remainder of the quarter, but it started off as a really good quarter for BlackRock. Thanks. Have a good one.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference, and you may now disconnect."],"3568":["BlackRock, Inc.

My name is Sigie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2019 Earnings Teleconference.","Our host for today\u2019s call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Chris Meade","Good morning, everyone. I am Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that during the course of this call we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock\u2019s actual results may of course differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So, with that, I will turn it over to Gary. ","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2019. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results.","BlackRock generated $65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter or 4% annualized organic asset growth, reflecting our differentiated solutions-based approach to addressing client needs. Our first quarter results reflect the benefits of our integrated business model and the investments we have made to diversify our investment platform, enhance our risk management and technology capabilities, and build local expertise at global scale.","First quarter revenue of $3.3 billion was 7% lower than a year ago, reflecting the impact of fourth quarter equity market declines on our 2019 base fee entry rate.","Operating income of $1.2 billion was down 11% compared to a year ago, while earnings per share of $6.61 was down 1%, as lower operating income and a higher effective tax rate were partially offset by higher non-operating income and a lower share count in the current quarter.","Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $135 million of net investment income, driven by higher marks on our unhedged seed capital investments and the revaluation of certain strategic minority investments.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the first quarter was approximately 22% and included a $22 million discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation awards that vested during the quarter. We continue to estimate that 24% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for the remainder of 2019 though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on tax legislation.","First quarter base fees of $2.8 billion were down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to the negative impact of non-U.S. equity markets and foreign exchange on average AUM and an associated mix change favoring lower fee fixed income assets compared to a year ago. On a constant currency basis base fees were down 3% year-over-year.","Sequentially, base fees were up 1% or 3% after adjusting for the impact of a lower day count in the first quarter, driven by market appreciation, organic base fee growth and higher securities lending revenue. On an equivalent day count basis, BlackRock\u2019s fee rate increased from 18 basis points in the fourth quarter to 18.2 basis points for the first quarter of 2019.","Performance fees of $26 million decreased meaningfully from a year ago, reflecting lower revenue from liquid alternatives and long only equity products. As noted on our fourth quarter earnings call, investment underperformance entering the first quarter resulted in certain quarterly locking funds falling below high watermarks. We saw improved performance in many of these funds during the last three months, which better positions us for the remainder of the year.","Continued momentum in institutional Aladdin resulted in 11% year-over-year growth in quarterly technology services revenue, and 17% year-over-year growth on a trailing 12-month basis. As Larry will discuss in more detail, overall demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions.","Advisory and other revenue of $49 million was down $22 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower earnings attributable to an equity method investment. On a sequential basis, the decline reflected lower fees from advisory and transition management assignments.","Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year, primarily due to lower compensation and volume related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $54 million or 5% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower operating income.","Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was up 5%, primarily reflecting higher seasonal payroll taxes, and an increase in issuance and mark-to-market of deferred compensation, partially offset by lower incentive compensation driven in part by lower performance fees.","Direct fund expense was down $19 million or 7% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the negative impact of equity and foreign exchange markets on average index AUM.","G&A expense was up 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher technology expense, partially offset by the impact of product launch cost in the first quarter of 2018. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $61 million, reflecting seasonally lower marketing and promotional expense, lower professional services expense and $31 million of contingent consideration fair value adjustments related to prior acquisitions recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 41.9% was down 220 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the negative impact of markets and foreign exchange on quarterly base fees and a strategic decision to continue investing responsibly for the long-term. While we are always margin aware, we have deep conviction in the stability of our business model, which allows us to better navigate the financial challenges associated with short-term market volatility.","Since year end, beta has been constructive, organic growth has improved and a number of our hedge funds are back above high watermarks. All of which contributed to 9% growth in our assets under management and position as well for the second quarter.","We remain focused on funding our most critical strategic initiatives to optimize organic growth and significantly advanced two of these strategic initiatives, technology and illiquid alternatives during the first quarter. We are confident these investments will enhance outcomes for clients and generate long-term value for shareholders.","Last month, we announced the binding offer an exclusive agreement to acquire eFront, the world\u2019s leading end-to-end alternative investment management software and solutions provider. As clients increasingly add to their alternatives allocations, the ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on a single platform will be critical.","The combination of eFront with Aladdin will set a new standard in investment and risk management technology, and reinforce Aladdin\u2019s value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system in the world. Subject to the French Works Council process, we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter.","We have also announced the first close of long-term private capital, LTPC is an innovative perpetual direct private equity fund designed to create value for the long-term. Limit reinvestment risk and operate with lower volatility than comparable vehicles. It\u2019s a crucial new component of BlackRock\u2019s comprehensive alternative investment capabilities, which now include hedge funds solutions, real assets, private credit and direct private equity. LTPC is another example of BlackRock\u2019s ability to assess the market, organically develop our capabilities and deliver the products and solutions clients need most.","Our capital management strategy has always been to first invest in our business and then return excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As previously announced, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $3.30 per share of common stock and repurchased $1.6 billion worth of common shares in the first quarter including $1.3 billion repurchased in a private transaction at approximately $413 per share. We have now completed our targeted level of share repurchases for 2019, but we will remain opportunistic should relative valuation opportunities arise.","BlackRock is having deeper and more strategic conversations, with a greater number of clients than ever before and our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we have made to assemble the industry\u2019s broadest offering of active and index investment strategies, coupled with technology and portfolio construction tools. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve clients\u2019 needs in a variety of market environments and enables us to generate consistent and differentiated organic growth.","Quarterly net inflows of $65 billion were positive across active and index strategies, as well as in our cash management business. BlackRock\u2019s institutional franchise generated $29 billion of net inflows representing 4% annualized organic asset growth, flows were led by momentum in fixed income, reflecting continued demand for liability driven investment solutions and our top performing active strategies. Institutional active net inflows of $15 billion were driven by $13 billion of active fixed income flows reflecting strong activity in our insurance client channel.","Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise continued into 2019. Record quarterly net inflows of $6 billion were led by infrastructure, real estate, private credit and the previously mentioned first close of LTPC. In addition, we have approximately $22 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of strategies, representing a significant source of future base and performance fees.","iShares net inflows of $31 billion reflected global client demand for a diverse range of strategies, including core, fixed income, factor and sustainable ETFs. We saw record quarterly flows in fixed income iShares as clients continue to adopt ETFs for corporate, emerging market and high yield bond exposures. Approximately 40% of iShares\u2019 close in the quarter were on higher fee products outside of the core, resulting in annualized organic base fee growth of 7% in line with organic asset growth in the quarter.","Retail net outflows of $1 billion reflected industry pressures in international equities and world allocation strategies, partially offset by strength in BlackRock\u2019s municipal fixed income franchise and event driven liquid alternatives funds.","Finally, BlackRock\u2019s cash management platform saw $6 billion of net inflows, as we continue to grow our cash business, leverage scale for clients and deliver innovative distribution and risk management solutions through a combination of Cachematrix and Aladdin.","In summary, our first quarter results highlight the breadth of our investment strategies, coupled with our industry-leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities and an ability to service clients on a global scale.","While we will never be immune to beta headwinds and the impact those headwinds can have in our short-term financial results, we intend to retain focus on investing in our highest growth priorities and exercising prudent expense discipline to ensure we meet the critical needs of clients and shareholders alike. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic growth in the most efficient way possible.","With that, I will turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Fink","Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining BlackRock\u2019s first quarter call. BlackRock\u2019s broad investment platform generated $65 billion of total net inflows in the first quarter, representing 4% organic asset growth and 3% organic base fee growth.","The breadth of our investment capabilities, spanning index, alpha-seeking, alternatives and cash, coupled with our industry leading technology and portfolio construction capabilities, allowed us to generate strong flows, and importantly, meeting the evolving needs of our global clients. BlackRock\u2019s commitment to staying ahead of our client needs continues to resonate and we are deepening those relationships with our clients throughout the world more than ever before.","Following significant declines in equity markets in the fourth quarter of last year, investors reverse their risk tolerance at the start of 2019. U.S. markets have regained their losses and both developed an emerging market equities, although not fully recovering from about 10% year-to-date. High yield fixed income the most challenged category last year is now seeing inflows.","Improved investor sentiment has been driven in part by easing concerns around the global monetary policy and trade. The Federal Reserve and other central banks are emphasizing a more patient approach to monetary policy, quieting investments -- investors\u2019 fears of tightening monetary policy and conditions late in our cycle. And investors\u2019 focus on trade tensions have declined relative to last year, as negotiations between the United States and China progresses.","Despite strong market performance year-to-date, average market levels are still lower than they are a year ago and investor optimism remains fragile as geopolitical risk and global growth concerns persist.","While recent development in China should increase global capital investment spending notably weak Eurozone PMI data, it signals further slowdown in Europe, and the U.K. although a hard Brexit has been avoided in the near-term, those issues remain unresolved.","In this global context, clients are continuing to turn to BlackRock. Our focus has always been and always will be to listen to our client\u2019s goals and challenges, so we could better anticipate and evolve ahead of our clients\u2019 needs.","Today clients are increasingly asking for more transparency. They are searching for more value, and most importantly, like we are seeing in so many other industries, clients are looking for more convenience. And they want sustainable long-term returns, but they also want everyone\u2019s focusing on their outcomes and these are the major issues that impacting I would say the asset management industry today.","I wrote in my letter to shareholders this year about the need for more dialogue around long-term outcomes. As we have done throughout our history, BlackRock continues to invest in our investment platform and our technology to deliver the outcomes our clients are looking for.","Every decision we make is centered on enhancing our ability to partner with our clients. In two months, we will cross the 10-year anniversary of BlackRock\u2019s announcement to acquire Barclays Global Investors. Over the last 10 years, our strategy behind the merger has resonated being agnostic across alpha and index industries allows us to have a different voice -- a differentiating voice for our clients.","Much has changed for our industry and for BlackRock in this past decade, rather than looking for individual products, clients are increasingly seeking a partner to help them create tailored portfolios. It\u2019s only by delivering that to clients that we can drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders, and that is why we continue to evolve our platform and organization today.","BlackRock\u2019s strategy for delivering long-term growth is centered on three main drivers; capturing the shift from product selection to portfolio construction; leading in technology across the asset management value chain; and gaining global and local expertise in high future growth markets around the world. We do all of this with the ultimate goal again of enhancing our clients\u2019 experience and deepening our client relationships globally.","Last year, we launched the Client Portfolio Solutions teams to formally bring together the strategic advantages that enable us to create a whole portfolio of solution for both institutional and wealth clients.","Leveraging BlackRock\u2019s differentiated research, our investment and technology capabilities and portfolio construction, Client Portfolio Solutions generated more than $11 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and continues to gain strong momentum. We are expanding our capabilities across portfolio of building blocks and investing in areas of highest client demands and ETFs are one of those areas.","iShares generated $31 billion of net inflows in the first quarter and once again capture the number one market share of ETF flows globally in Europe, as well as the high-growth categories including fixed income ETFs, factor ETFs and sustainable ETFs.","This quarter flows reflects the diversity of our iShares platform, by region in addition we saw $17 billion of net inflows in U.S. iShares and we generated $15 billion of net inflows in European iShares, which represented a 17% organic growth.","In higher growth -- in higher fee iShares categories including fixed income factors and sustainable ETF, we generated a total of $38 billion of net inflows and core iShares generate $19 billion in the first quarter.","While these flows are partially offset by outflows from a handful of equity iShares, which reflects the reversal of strong fourth quarter tax related inflows, iShares continues to benefit from long-term secular trends, including the global shift to portfolio construction and to fee-based wealth management.","Financial advisors are increasingly adopting models to customize portfolio for clients in a simple and scalable way. The use of models is driving demand for both ETFs and high performing alpha strategies, in addition to digital tools that help advisors better see where risk and fees are being allocated and BlackRock is well-positioned for that.","After more muted growth in 2018, we are seeing renewed demand for fixed income securities. BlackRock generated $80 billion of fixed income inflows across active and indexed products. Flows were led by increased adaptation of fixed income ETFs, which generated $32 billion of net inflows across high yield, emerging market bonds and treasuries.","Non-ETF index fixed income flows of $29 billion were driven demand for LDI strategies as clients immunize their portfolios and we saw diversified flows into our top performing active fixed income platform, with net inflows of $18 billion across core fixed income, municipal bonds and high yield strategies.","Performance in our active fixed income strategies remain strong with 83% and 85% of assets above benchmark or peer median for the three-year and five-year period. We are constantly innovating across our platform to meet client needs and delivering growth for shareholders.","For example, in cash management where we generated $6 billion of inflows in the quarter, we are leveraging our Cachematrix technology to improve convenience and transparency for our clients.","We are also innovating on the types of cash management strategy we offer to clients and last week we launched a Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund or LEAF as a prime money market fund with an environmentally focused strategy. The fund will use 5% of its net revenues to purchase and retire carbon offsets and direct a portion of proceeds to our conservation efforts. Increasingly, clients want sustainable strategies that provide financial returns and target a measurable social or economic impact. BlackRock\u2019s goal is to make those strategies more accessible to more people.","Beyond dedicated sustainable investment funds, we are also integrating environmental, social and government risk factors across all our investment processes. We firmly believe business relevant sustainable data is useful for all of our portfolio managers and ultimately results in decision making that delivers better long-term results for our investors and our clients.","With our continued focus on evolving ahead of clients\u2019 needs, we are also developing an innovative new private equity vehicles design to meet it institutional client needs for the long-term high quality private company exposures.","BlackRock Long-Term Private Capital strategy, LTPC offers institutions the opportunity to invest on the continuum between publicly traded equities and leveraged buyout style private equity. The fund will have a perpetual structure and an active ownership approach designed to create value for the long-term. At the end of the first quarter, LTPC secured $1.25 billion of capital commitments and cornerstone investments.","Including LTPC BlackRock had a record quarter in our illiquid alternative business with $6 billion of net inflows and clients continue to search for yield and attractive risk adjusted returns. We also deployed $2 billion of committed capital in the first quarter and have another $22 billion of remaining capital to deploy.","As we look to bridge the gap between public and private assets, we also realized that clients benefit when alternative investments are evaluated inside a portfolio level risk management framework. That is why we announced last week our exclusive agreement subject to conditions to acquire eFront. This acquisition will deepen BlackRock\u2019s strength in two of our strategic growth areas, our illiquid alternatives and technology, and will enable portfolios that span traditional and alternative asset classes to be managed much more comprehensively.","Technology is changing every aspect of the asset management landscape and BlackRock\u2019s results milestones and continuum innovation are only possible, because we prioritize making technology essential to our entire business. Strong global momentum continues in our Aladdin business driving 11% growth over year-over-year in our technology services revenues.","A number of new client wins in the first quarter including Santander, the first asset manager to use Aladdin in markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Portugal, and momentum and investments we are making in technology will continue to drive our technology services revenues growth to the low- to mid-teens going forward.","BlackRock\u2019s long-term strategy is to provide technology across asset management value chain and we are expanding our technology platform beyond our core Aladdin business to deepen our value proposition with clients and partners, and generate direct technology revenues for the firm.","As the investment management ecosystem seeks deeper integration a long investment life cycle, we are extending Aladdin to our asset servicing providers to further unlock the network effects of Aladdin platform. Earlier this month, we announced the strategic alliance with Bank of New York Mellon to deliver an integrated data technology and asset management service capability to share clients to provide Aladdin.","By enabling access to investment management and servicing capabilities on one platform, client will be able to further optimize, and optimize their operating models and reduce operating expenses.","One of the biggest opportunities for Aladdin going forward is to make the language of portfolio construction for wealth management, wealth managers, financial advisors, individual investors. Aladdin Wealth is now live with nine clients based in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe and Asia.","We see tremendous opportunities for Aladdin Wealth to become the infrastructure of a wealth management landscape. But more importantly it provides BlackRock with an opportunity to deepen our value proposition and brand with wealth partners and their financial advisors.","Accelerating trends included the movement towards portfolio solutions and a wider product usage necessary -- necessity of operating scale, enhanced regulatory reporting are creating the need globally for more comprehensive and a more flexible technology driven solution. Aladdin remains well positioned to capitalize on these trends as the industry, leading whole portfolio investment operating system.","Just as we continue to innovate and evolve our investment and technology business to meet our clients\u2019 needs we are also evolving BlackRock leaders and we are evolving our organization to enhance client experiences with BlackRock.","We made organizational leadership changes every few years because we firmly believe these changes bring great benefits to our clients, to our shareholders and to our leaders themselves. Recent announcements are centered on bringing BlackRock closer to our clients, deepening our relationships with them and more efficiently and more effectively delivering all of BlackRock\u2019s capabilities to our clients. These changes help us maintain our entrepreneurial spirit by bringing in fresh ideas to different areas of the firm and further developing our leaders around the world.","I can say, very proudly, that I have never been more excited about BlackRock\u2019s organization and our people than any time in our history. We begin 2019 by maintaining our steadfast focus on client needs. This will continue to position BlackRock as the right partner for our clients and a leader in the growth areas of the future.","With that, let me open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Laurence Fink","Hey, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey. Good morning, Larry. So we continue to see BlackRock expand further in that tax sector here. We saw this again in the first quarter the acquisition of eFront. My question is how will BlackRock clients use this software technology? And also more importantly, how do you plan on monetizing this technology, including potentially supporting your alternative fundraising effort?","Laurence Fink","So we look at technology in five business brands across BlackRock and we are focused on every business. Actually we had a leadership retreat last week this past weekend. And we spoke about how we have to work on technology in every business. It\u2019s not the business that BlackRock that should be untouched with technology. Technology has to be the component of shaping how we do business.","So we look at technology in five different areas. We look at technology to deliver better alpha using more data sources. We are using technology now, as I spoke about in my prepared remarks, creating technology for more convenient portfolio construction.","Obviously, we are using technology with more operational efficiencies, Aladdin provider is a good example. Throughout our history, we are using more and more technology for risk management. And now we are using technology to create more convenience with our clients by delivering better tools for distribution and so we are framing technology across all these businesses.","eFront really is a great example of us using a technology to really help us in delivering two out of the three major long-term strategies that we spoke about in my shareholder letter. We speak about why technology has to be driving BlackRock and why alternatives have to continue to drive the future of BlackRock. And eFront still helps us deliver in those two key categories, the third one is China. If I have to say a fourth one is retirement, but those are two of the key characteristics of our forward growth strategy.","Related to eFront in itself it is going to be provided as a new revenue component of Aladdin and it\u2019s going to be an add-on cost to our Aladdin platform. It is -- and so it will be integrated on top of the Aladdin platform over time, but it will be another sleeve and we are actually there were some overlaps with the clients and there were many new clients that are part of eFront, so it allows us to have broader depth globally worldwide.","And so we look at this acquisition as another milestone of us really trying to build technology across all asset categories and we did cite that we had some weaknesses in alternative technology in Aladdin and this really helps us accelerate the added sleeves of alternative technology on Aladdin. So this will be another revenue center for BlackRock as a part of the Aladdin platform.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thank you, Larry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Lee from KBW. Your line is now open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Robert.","Robert Lee","Great. Good morning. Good morning, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just flush out a little bit on the alternatives platform. Obviously, you spent in addition to the eFront, you have spent a lot of time and energy with some acquisition, the organic growth. Can you may be -- where do you feel like you stand with your old platform in terms of do you feel like at this point you have the most of the strategies covered or -- and it\u2019s more about kind of scaling with subsequent funds or are there still places you feel like there\u2019s maybe whole of\u2026","Laurence Fink","Sure.","Robert Lee","\u2026 you are looking to fill?","Laurence Fink","Let me have Gary start it off and I will try to answer if I need too.","Gary Shedlin","Yeah. Rob, I think, we feel that we are very well situated on the illiquid platform at the moment, obviously, we have got a range of products now that span kind of across the more major categories. LTPC firmly puts us in the direct private equity, obviously, we have a significant real estate business and infrastructure business, a private credit business. We have a variety of solutions-oriented businesses, whether it would be funded hedged funds, funded private equity and broader alternative solutions.","So I think we feel like we have got a foot in every one of the high growth markets. I think when we add it all up today we have got about $65 billion plus in illiquid plus another $22 billion or so of committed capital to go. So that gives us a fair amount of scale.","I think when you look at the individual businesses, one could argue that individually they are not big enough and so that will come obviously with successor funds and continuing to develop -- continue to deliver the returns that our investors expect, and so obviously, as we do that I think successor funds will get bigger.","And we will continue to opportunistically look for tactical opportunities to create more scale in those businesses. But as I think we have been very, very clear culture is incredibly important to us. We are not really looking to buy out anybody. We are really looking to buy in people who want to be a part of our very differentiated platform and we see those opportunities as we have seen in the past with our new partners from Tennenbaum or First Reserve and others.","We will do things that basically make sense not only for clients but also for our shareholders. So bottomline is, we will continue to see what\u2019s out there and be opportunistic, but we feel like we have got a pretty good growth platform right now.","Laurence Fink","As you know, Rob, we have been very systematic in how we have been approaching this. It has not been what I would call it metamorphic by any means. If you think about just our infrastructure platform, we started really infrastructure in 2012 by lifting out a team of people. We are over $20 billion now in infrastructure growing quite nicely. We are raising a couple more funds. So it\u2019s been very systematic and I think the same thing will be done over LTPC. Over time that\u2019s going to be continue to grow. We actually have opportunities that continue to build that out.","We have real estate and so over time this is a growth area. Our first quarter was up $6 billion in growth. That was a record quarter for us as Gary suggested. We have $20 billion or $22 billion of the drag of committed capital right now and that they will be put to work. We look at this as a real opportunity and our clients are looking to us to be really focused on these types of opportunities. So I am pretty constructive on where we are at this point in time.","Robert Kapito","Can I add one thing? The other part that we are excited about is that we have done some institutional surveys and it shows that the largest reallocation is going to be to the alternative space. So we do need to have a wide product base to be able to satisfy our current clients\u2019 needs.","But also you know that we are very important to the retail base and they want exposure to the alternatives area. So we are also working very closely with our retail distribution partners to create the appropriate wrappers, to put the alternatives that have the appropriate risk and reward for those clients that are looking for it. So it\u2019s not just institutional investors, it\u2019s also retail investors that are looking to us for some exposure in the alternative space.","Robert Lee","Okay. Thank you. Can I ask may be a tactical follow-up question, Larry, you mentioned there being some kind of reversal of the fourth quarter ETF equity flows that were driven by tax reasons. But broadly across the industry despite this big rebound in the market to kind of feels like demand for equities in general both index and active have been pretty muted. Is there -- is this really more just symptomatic of the people bifurcating the portfolios more going to alternatives than, obviously, better fixed income demand or is there something else going on underneath that business?","Laurence Fink","So the question we saw strong rerisking for those were in cash and allocated back into fixed income. We saw that predominantly -- a lot of investors were believing that interest rates are going to go higher, Central Banks really continue to tighten and obviously the change in Central Bank forward forecast and their behaviors many investors were underinvested and put duration to work across the Board.","As we have seen as Rob Kapito just mentioned we are seeing investors continue to barbell, I think, going more and more heavy into alternative spaces. What the first quarter showed also that investors are still selling equity exposures. As an industry there were major outflows again in overall global equities as an industry.","This is one of the reasons why I actually believe we are at a pivot point now where equivalent markets despite the rally can have much more upside because the amount of under investments investors have in equities they have not rerisk in equities in the first quarter.","And so to me -- we believed as you are starting to see renewed economic activity in the United States from the slow pace of the first quarter and we are moving closer to about 2.5% economy in the second quarter, we are seeing a stronger economic signal out of China from all the fears we have in the third and fourth quarter. So I would argue there is a high probability going forward that investors are going to begin to rerisk across the equity platforms.","And what we hear from investors and we see, investors coming in every day seeing our leaders, seeing Rob, seeing me and the biggest question is we are being asked continuously, where should we put our money? There is huge pools of money sitting in the sideline and many people how we are going to have the continued downdraft in the fourth quarter. They thought interest rates are going to go higher. A lot of -- as I said the biggest risk is that clients are under invested not over invested. So we see more upside here, especially, in equities. ","Robert Kapito","So one thing on the tactical comment, if you started last year with a 60-40 stock mix, which is what most people have, by the time you got to somewhere in October, that number would have been 80-20, which is really too much risk. So you saw a lot of tactical asset allocation changes to get their portfolios back to 60-40, which means you have to sell stocks and buy bonds. And at the same time, the risk free rate during the year went from zero to 3% so bonds look pretty good coming out of cash.","So I think we saw that in November and December. That added to the fuel to -- for the first time being able to take a tax loss for a very long time. But now in the first quarter that people are getting back to where they wanted to be, I think, the risk on trade is coming back into the marketplace and you see that reflected in where they are allocating their money tactically now.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Patrick Davitt from Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Patrick Davitt","Hey. Good morning, guys. ","Laurence Fink","Hi. How are you?","Patrick Davitt","I am well. Thanks. You mentioned that the nine live Aladdin for Wealth clients. Could you update us where you think we are on the ramp-up of noticeable incremental flow from those nine go lives, update us on the pipeline of new go lives this year and are there any meaningful milestones you are just looking to see a more noticeable uptick inflows from that channel?","Robert Kapito","So we are very optimistic on the Aladdin for Wealth, because for the first time it gives a lot of the financial advisors the ability to look and test their clients portfolios to make sure that they are taking the right risk in them. And so as they come on, we are building it together.","They are asking can we do this, can we do this, what can we show our clients and of course within each system, the things that these firms are able to send out to their clients have to be approved they sent out that takes a little time.","So there\u2019s a little bit of a lag. So there was a lag in implementation, and now we are in process with many of them on getting them on to the systems and to understand how it works and what they can actually use for their clients.","So it is been an eye opening experience for many of their clients. What we didn\u2019t realize was that Aladdin for Wealth can be used as an asset gathering tool and most clients in the retail area have accounts at more than one firm. And if you are one of the firms that can show your client the risk and reward of their portfolios and then improve it that is a great advantage, and we are seeing a lot of money move for those who have Aladdin to with from people that don\u2019t have it.","Also the business has moved from individual stock and bond picking to asset allocation and portfolio construction and that\u2019s what the financial advisors are expected to be able to do. By using Aladdin for Wealth, they are able to take not only one portfolio but hundreds of portfolios and organize them in an appropriate way for risk return using portfolio construction.","It also helps each of these individual institutions utilize their models, as well as have an alternative model to compare it against BlackRock\u2019s models and so Aladdin for Wealth is helping the financial advisor to have tools for better decision making right at their fingertips, and also, of course, if they are using our portfolio allocation or our tools, there\u2019s a high probability that they may look favorably upon our products.","In portfolio construction today, because of the way the compensation system works, they want to use the cheapest products that they can find to do that portfolio allocation and those wind up being ETFs and index product, of which we have a significant market share.","So Aladdin for Wealth is helping the financial advisors have the tools to do their job better. It\u2019s helping us to be part of the infrastructure and the ecosystem to build out better tools and technology for our firms that unfortunately under invested in technology and at this time cost is very important to be able to buy it a good price and have it maintained is, I think, just going to grow for the future.","So we are very excited about it. But as we have done with Aladdin, as we have brought clients on, we are learning as well what some of the advisors are in need and we are building it together to have the best tools and the tools will also create an ecosystem that also is working with their custodians so that it\u2019s much easier.","And Larry mentioned the word convenience, so it\u2019s a tool that\u2019s right at their fingertips that they can log on and get really good information and very good scrubbed data so that they can have a better system.","Gary Shedlin","But Patrick, just to be clear, so I just some of the terminology, I just want to make sure we are clear on. I mean the most significant, immediate impact from a P&L standpoint is obviously to see the revenue show up in our technology services line which is where the Aladdin Wealth line will hit.","There\u2019s two components to Aladdin Wealth, there\u2019s kind of that what I would call more of the top-down kind of home office view, which is really driving the technology revenue and then there will be that bottoms up impact that basically will happen at the individual adviser level which will generate approach which I think was your initial question.","Keep in mind, a lot of this is happening real-time we are rolling it out right now at many places. There is an element of training and getting all of these advisers up to speed on all the new tools that they will have at their disposal. So the flow, the flow deltas, which will then drive our base fees is going to take a little bit longer than the immediate impact of that technology revenue that you are going to see much more immediately.","In other situations like, Envestnet, where we that is not an Aladdin Wealth but basically putting our portfolio construction technology on the desktop of the IRAs that have, again I think there you will see basically more impact in base fees because there\u2019s no specific technology revenue associated with that type of partnership.","Laurence Fink","But early indications before the Aladdin Wealth users who have been on the longest there is evidence of increased\u2026","Gary Shedlin","Yes.","Laurence Fink","\u2026 flows to BlackRock. We don\u2019t have enough statistics to really identify where it is. We don\u2019t have enough data with all the different users. As we said nine clients worldwide and we are in conversations with many more clients. So our objective is to have as Rob just suggested the architecture or risk in the wealth management channel using Aladdin for Wealth.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Michael.","Michael Cyprys","Hey. Good morning. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just on another question on Aladdin here with eFront that now brings you into alternatives. Just curious as you look across the Aladdin platform what other adjacencies could make sense or capabilities that you would like to see strengthened with Aladdin particularly as you look across the competitive landscape today?","Gary Shedlin","I think we are committed to being an end-to-end provider for risk management and analytics across from the front to the back. So I think we have been building out a lot of that in particular ourselves. I think the decision to do eFront was a conscious decision frankly that it was going to take us a lot longer to build that. Our belief is that the eFront transaction accelerates our development in the private asset classes conservatively by five-plus years. So I think we felt we needed to attack there when we can.","Otherwise, I think, we will continue to add on all the obvious adjacencies when we think about an end-to-end provider and we continue again to continue to be tactical and opportunistic to basically balance where we think it makes sense to buy versus where we think it makes sense to build.","Laurence Fink","But it\u2019s clear that we are -- if you look at our strategy in terms of inorganic opportunities, we are scrubbing, we are reviewing, we are really trying to understand the whole technology environment. That\u2019s where we are focused on.","I have been saying this over quarters-and-quarters. We are not focused on asset management M&A in the developed markets. We are focused on if there is an inorganic opportunity in technology that adds more opportunities to be, as Gary said end-to-end provider, whether that\u2019s a data provider or a new technology or AI, we will continue to be either building it or using it -- using opportunities to acquire and that\u2019s what we are very much focused on and we have a whole team continuously looking at the whole ecosystem worldwide.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, Gary, maybe just a refresher on some of the guidance that you guys provided in the beginning of the year, given the fact that markets move pretty considerably over the course of Q1, maybe how you guys thinking about outlook for G&A for the rest of the year. I think your original guide implies something a $1.6 billion kind of annual number, does that still hold and then any other comments around expenses would be helpful? Thanks.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Alex. I would say really short answer is no change in guidance. I think that, as we said at the beginning of the year, we are very focused on managing the entire discretionary expense base. We continue to see our 2019 kind of core level of G&A expense to be essentially flat to our core level for last year and we are continuing to invest.","I mean, as always there are things that come up that are effectively kind of not manageable, so we saw another, let\u2019s call it, I would say, roughly $15 million to $20 million of kind of like non-core G&A in this quarter between paying some fees to get eFront done and some more purchase price contingency, fair market value adjustments and some FX implications. But in terms of what we are managing, we are continuing to stick to the plan that we laid out for our Board in January.","I think that we try to anticipate. We saw some volatility. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, we are very much focused on the long-term not trying to manage doing margin on a quarter-to-quarter basis, obviously, we saw a lot of that beta back, which obviously better positioned us and I think we feel a little bit better with the markets where they are right now, when we went into our budgeting season back in the fall. But we are not going to continue to keep an eye down the field and play offense, and continue trying to optimize growth in the most efficient way possible.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeremy Campbell from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Campbell","Hi. Thanks guys. Just wanted to ask a quick one on the advisory and other line, I know you guys had mentioned some items that moved it on a year-over-year and sequential basis, but it was a pretty big step down. And so, I guess, just what\u2019s the outlook and how should we think about that line going forward from this lower 1Q type level?","Robert Kapito","So our other revenue line item is really made up of three main components. The biggest component frankly is an equity method investment that we have had for a number of years, which is, obviously, where we are getting our attributable share of somebody else\u2019s earnings and that one is a little more complicated because we don\u2019t control that. And that frankly on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I am sorry, year-over-year basis was the most significant change there.","The other two businesses that are effectively in that is our FMA business, our Financial Markets Advisory business, as well as our transition investment management business. I would say those are both smaller revenue line items, where there is significantly more consistency and those are both businesses that are important to BlackRock that we continue to look to grow and annuitize as much as we can. Albeit both of those tend to have some what I would call more capital market centric elements to them. So they are a little bit really the biggest piece of that year-over-year change was the equity method now. I think everybody knows who that is and you guys can track that as well as we can.","Operator","Thank you. Your last question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Laurence Fink","Hi, Ken.","Ken Worthington","Hi. Thank you for -- hi. Thank you for squeezing me in. Can you help us frame how iShares\u2019 operating margins and iShares\u2019 margins on incremental revenue have evolved over the last say two years or three years, clearly core is much bigger, fee rates are down, but assets are way up. So given the various cross-current, I was hoping to frame how margins might look in iShares and to what extent the significant growth in core and iShares overall have impacted the margins on incremental revenue there?","Gary Shedlin","So, Ken, as you know we tend -- we don\u2019t talk margins of our individual businesses. We are very focused on a one BlackRock model to avoid all of our businesses operating at silos. It\u2019s very important to our culture and it\u2019s how we manage the business day-in and day-out. So we don\u2019t have those types of fully allocated P&Ls for our businesses, because we don\u2019t think of it in general is the right behavior day-to-day.","I can help you on the revenue line item. I think back in December, we were at Goldman and we talked about what we see as effectively the long-term growth potential for iShares and ETFs. I think we outlined a 12% to 15% kind of topline asset growth rate.","I think we do anticipate certain sectors growing faster than others, which is why we have tried to point people to an organic base fee rate that will be less than that. Historically, I think we have seen an organic base fee rate somewhere around 6 points to 7 points, less than that, which is part of the slide we put out at Goldman. Don\u2019t hold me exactly for those numbers you will have to go see it, but I think that\u2019s about what it was.","And that takes into account both mix change in terms of faster growth in the core, but also as well as some of the strategic pricing investments we have made and we will likely continue to make that make sense for both clients and for our shareholders alike.","This quarter in particular, we actually saw organic base fee growth equal to organic asset growth. It was right in the 7% area, and again, I think, that is a function again of about 40% of the flows being outside of the core and that\u2019s an area whether it be fixed income, strategic beta factors, ESG or other precision exposures frankly that tend to be more capital markets centric and the importance of that obviously is that those are higher fee than the core itself and I think we do continue to believe very strongly that as we see growth in the core, we also see growth outside of the core as people are tactically allocating portfolios around the core ETFs.","So that\u2019s what I would tell you about the revenue. I think we feel very comfortable that that iShares business will be growing in excess of our 5% longer term growth target. But as it relates to specific margins, I will leave that to you guys to try and sort through, we don\u2019t manage the business that way. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Fink","I do. I want to just thank everybody for joining this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock. I believe our first quarter results are directly linked to the investments we have made over time and our deep partnerships we built with our clients globally. I think we differentiated ourselves by continuing to leverage our scale. We continue to invest broad investment and technology platform to deliver value to our clients and shareholders. We are continuing to drive technology as a leading -- in the transformation of who BlackRock is and the transformation of how BlackRock works with our clients and we will continue to do that. With that everyone have a very nice spring and we will be talking to you sometime in July. Thanks. ","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry and Gary make their remarks, let me remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we say today. And additionally, BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll get out of the way and let the call begin.","Gary S. Shedlin","Thanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly and full year financials and discuss our fourth quarter business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as adjusted results.","Overall, 2013 was a strong year for BlackRock shareholders, clients and employees. And our solid fourth quarter results position us well going into 2014. BlackRock delivered fourth quarter earnings per share of $4.92 and operating income of $1.1 billion, up 24% and 10%, respectively, compared to 2012. Full year EPS of $16.58 was up 21% compared to 2012, reflecting operating income of $4 billion, which was 13% higher.","Fourth quarter nonoperating results reflected a $61 million increase in the market value of our seed and co-investments, largely driven by continued appreciation of private equity, distressed credit and hedge fund-related investments. Our 26.5% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from several favorable non-recurring items. We continue to believe that 31% represents a reasonable long-term projected rate, so our actual 2014 tax rate may be closer to 30% as a consequence of additional non-recurring items, which may arise during the coming year.","In the fourth quarter, we saw approximately $40 billion of long-term net new flows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 4.3%. Total long-term net new business for 2013 was approximately $117 billion, representing a 3.4% organic growth rate. BlackRock continues to demonstrate the stability of its diversified multi-client platform with organic growth across each of our client businesses and solid growth from our Retail and iShares franchises.","Fourth quarter revenues were $2.8 billion, up $238 million or 9% from a year ago, and were driven by strong growth in base fees, performance fees and revenues from BlackRock Solutions. Revenues for 2013 totaled $10.2 billion, up 9% versus 2012. We experienced year-over-year base fee growth across all long-dated asset classes. And base fees, performance fees and solutions revenues each reached record levels for the full year.","Fourth quarter base fees rose 10% year-over-year, driven by a combination of market strength, organic growth and the acquisitions of the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse ETF and MGPA businesses, offset by continued pressure in securities lending spreads. Performance fees for the quarter were $268 million, up 12% from a year ago, reflecting very strong results across BlackRock's alternatives platform including our hedge fund of funds platform and a diverse set of single-strategy hedge funds. While last year's fourth quarter included a large onetime fee related to the wind down of the U.S. government PPIP portfolio, this quarter benefited from a similarly sized performance fee associated with an opportunistic 2007 vintage closed-end mortgage fund, which was partially liquidated in December. As we have previously indicated, the fourth quarter is generally our seasonally strongest performance fee generating quarter for the year.","BlackRock Solutions revenues of $157 million were up 15% year-over-year and roughly flat to the third quarter. Our Aladdin business, which represents 73% of BRS revenue in the quarter, signed more than 15 new clients in 2013 including one of its largest ever and continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Sequential results were impacted by the timing and recognition of certain fees and expenses.","Our Financial Markets Advisory business, or FMA, signed more than 50 new assignments during the year and continues to post strong revenues even as the business transitions from a crisis management emphasis to a more institutionalized advisory business model with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the new regulatory environment. The decline in fourth quarter other revenue was primarily driven by equity method earnings attributable to our ownership stake in PennyMac.","Expenses for the fourth quarter rose $136 million year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue-related items including compensation and direct fund expense and increased levels of G&A expense. Our full year compensation to revenue ratio fell by 40 basis points in 2013 to 34.5%, primarily driven by the proactive reshaping of our employee base including geographic location and the impact of positive beta.","Quarterly G&A expense rose $76 million sequentially and reflected a variety of factors, including increased marketing and promotion spend, ongoing and deal-related costs associated with acquisitions, relocation-driven occupancy and lease impairment charges, FX and other miscellaneous items. Excluding the timing impact of our marketing spend, approximately $15 million of this quarterly increase represents recurring expense associated with our continued growth.","Notwithstanding the increased level of G&A in the fourth quarter, our operating margin was 42.7%, relatively flat with year-ago levels, and 41.4% for the full year 2013, representing 100-basis-point increase over 2012 levels.","We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value with our first priority to invest in our business. In line with that strategy and as previously discussed, we completed the acquisition of MGPA on October 4, adding $11 billion in assets under management and extending BlackRock's real estate debt and equity investment capabilities to Asia Pacific and Europe. During 2013, we also returned approximately $2.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, representing a total payout ratio of 74%.","Heading into 2014, we remain committed to our predictable and balanced approach to capital management while also being mindful of the uncertain regulatory environment in which we are operating. Consistent with this, our Board of Directors has delayed a quarterly cash dividend of $1.93 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 15% over the current level. Since instituting our dividend in September of 2003, BlackRock has increased the dividend in every year other than 2009 when it was unchanged. Over that time period, the dividend has grown at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 24%. We repurchased an additional $250 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to $1 billion, and are committed to maintaining a steady level of repurchases into 2014.","Our strong financial results reflect the benefits of our improved investment performance, diverse platform and deep partnerships with our clients. We saw positive flows across all of our client businesses and regions with Retail and iShares continuing to drive growth. The breadth of BlackRock's platform was once again demonstrated by a record 12 Retail and iShares products, each generating more than $1 billion of net flows in the fourth quarter.","We continue to see strong results in Retail with flows of $16.6 billion for the quarter, representing a 15% annualized organic growth rate. U.S. Retail's long-term net flows of $9.4 billion for the quarter drove annualized organic growth of 12%. Our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunities fund, Global Long\/Short Credit fund and Multi-Asset Income fund continue to drive growth, with each delivering more than $1 billion in flows during the quarter. Fixed income flows of $2.5 billion were driven by solid investment performance, product diversification and success in our duration managed product suite.","International Retail saw long-term net flows of $7.2 billion for the quarter, representing an extremely strong annualized organic growth rate of 23%. Our European Equities suite continues to drive results with $2.9 billion of net new business during the quarter and $7.9 billion for the year, capturing 21% of category flows in 2013.","We also saw demand for our solutions-oriented multi-asset product line led by our Global Allocation, Managed Volatility and Dynamic Asset Allocation products. As a result of the changing regulatory landscape in Europe and its impact on the existing retrocession distribution model, we are witnessing growing Retail demand for efficiently packaged passive investment vehicles and made a decision to strategically reposition certain index mutual fund ranges previously targeted towards Institutional investors. In line with this strategy, we have reclassified approximately $20 billion of AUM related to these fund ranges from our Institutional channel to our Retail channel. This reclassification is presented in the column titled Adjustments in the AUM tables contained in our earnings release.","Global iShares once again led the industry with 27% market share of net flows in 2013. In the quarter, iShares raised $19.1 billion of net new business as equity inflows of $24.1 billion were partially offset by fixed income and commodities redemptions. Developed market equities attracted the majority of fourth quarter iShares flows, led by European and U.S. equity exposures, broad global funds and Japanese equities with modest outflows from emerging markets.","EMEA iShares led regional flows with $22 billion for the year, driving organic growth of 16% in 2013 and were well diversified across equities and fixed income as we expanded our efforts to penetrate new client segments and markets. The iShares Core Series targeted to buy-and-hold investors attracted approximately $11 billion of net flows during the quarter and approximately $20 billion for the year. Buy-and-hold segment represents a strong growth opportunity and continues to be an area of strategic focus.","Our Institutional business generated $4.8 billion of net long-term inflows in the fourth quarter, led by continued growth in defined contribution. Strong multi-asset inflows included $10.4 billion of assets related to 2 LifePath open-architecture mandates where we provide customized asset allocation glide paths, direct asset management and third-party manager selection. In connection with these new mandates, we reclassified approximately $6 billion of existing AUM from both indexed equity and indexed fixed income to active multi-asset to better reflect the overall nature of the mandate. This reclassification is also presented in the column titled Adjustments in the AUM tables contained in our earnings release.","Active equity outflows were driven by fundamental equity outflows of $1.5 billion and were primarily related to our U.K. equities business. We are seeing tangible benefits from the ongoing rebuild of our U.S. active equity business as fourth quarter results included a $1.8 billion fundamental large cap growth sub-advisory funding.","In alternatives, outflows were driven primarily by non-core active currency mandates and return of capital including the partial liquidation of the previously mentioned closed-end mortgage fund. However, we saw another strong quarter for our liquid alternatives, generating over $1 billion in commitments for the fourth consecutive quarter. During 2013, we secured $6 billion of total commitments, of which $5 billion have yet to be deployed.","Our full year results reflect successful navigation of the shareholder value roadmap we outlined at our June Investor Day: generate organic growth, demonstrate operating leverage and consistently return capital to shareholders. Our diverse platform and strong performance track record position us well to continue our journey as we enter 2014.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock has consistently advised our clients on the importance of making their money work for them. 2013 was another year that clearly highlighted the benefits of being fully invested and missed opportunities for more than $10 trillion of cash sitting on the sidelines. The S&P has more than doubled off of 2009 bottom. Certainly, generating outsized returns is going to be more challenging going forward. However, increased confidence in economic growth is providing support for asset prices, and I am constructive on equities for 2014. Same time, global political risk and market dependence on extraordinary monetary policy remains elevated, and policymakers and central bankers are going to have to get it right to keep the market even-keeled.","In the U.S., political conditions appear to be improving on the margin, and markets are acting -- reacting positively to the Fed's tapering announcement last month. Globally, Europe is slowly recovering, and I want to emphasize slowly. Investors are hoping that Japan will continue executing on its plans and that the market is paying close attention to China with its own set of proposed reforms.","Last year, we saw a huge divergence between developed markets and emerging market equities. And the performance diverged considerably, and most investors also lost money in bonds last year. Just being invested is not enough. Clients need to be properly positioned. At the core of BlackRock's value proposition for clients is our ability to constantly challenge ourselves and to evolve in the face of these changing market trends and client needs. The global diversified platform and strong alpha generation track record we built over the past 25 years at BlackRock positions us to provide the investment advice and solutions our clients need to meet their investment goals.","BlackRock raised $117 billion of long-term net new flows in 2013, representing a 3.4 organic growth rate. Our client mix continues to shift towards higher fee Retail and iShares business, which accounted for 88% of our organic asset growth and a larger percentage of our organic revenue growth this year. This growth helped us fuel a 13% increase in operating income and a 21% increase in earnings per share versus 2012. And these results speak to the strength of our business model, which I've talked about every quarter, the differentiated business model. And I believe it is that business model that will continue to give us the potential to accelerate even from here.","Over the course of the year, it was the collective strength of our platform across businesses, across regions, across asset classes that delivered for our clients and our shareholders. BlackRock's broad array of investment solutions drove growth in 2013 with 43 products raising more than $1 billion of net new flows versus 25 such products in 2012, highlighting our ability to meet the diverse needs of our clients.","As we've discussed in previous calls, the investment landscape is moving away from traditional style boxes as clients focus on achieving outcomes rather than buying products. BlackRock has built a very strong foundation to be the leader in the solution and outcome space.","In Global Retail, we are raising our profile through our branding efforts, evolving our product set in anticipation of changing market trends and deepening our distribution relationships with our distributing partners. BlackRock's clients are increasing their combined use of alpha and beta, including the broad-based adoption of passive products as building blocks, along with increasing standards for performance in a winner-take-all environment. And we are focused on retirement solutions and the importance of financial planning in the face of rising longevity.","Over the past several quarters, we've discussed the growth opportunities in Global Retail, and that growth is materializing. We saw Retail long-term flows of $39 billion for the year leading to 10% organic growth, a significant increase compared to the 3% growth we saw in 2012. International Retail had a very strong year with net inflows of $18 billion in 2013, representing a 15% organic growth rate. Flows were positive across major regions and diversified across asset classes, highlighting the benefit of our platforms' breadth and our ability to transcend our business across region.","Our top-performing BlackRock Equities franchise led the equity business with $8 billion of net flows this year. We also generated more than $4 billion of net flows in both fixed income and multi-asset class products and as investors turn to BlackRock to manage duration and volatility in their portfolios.","BlackRock's U.S. Retail business saw $21 billion of net flows in 2013, growing organically at 7%. Income was a key theme for U.S. Retail in 2013. Investors continue to search for yield in a low-rate environment and did so with an eye on rising rates and a growing appreciation for the risk of rising rates. BlackRock's platform, our client dialogue, our marketing campaign, were aligned to take advantage, and we were proactive in educating our clients about the risk in their fixed income portfolios. Flows across the income theme in 2013 were led by our top-performing strategic income opportunity fund, which brought in $7 billion of flows this year. Our Global Long\/Short Credit, our 0 duration liquid alternative product and our multi-asset income product each raised $4 billion in 2013 as investors looked for top-tier income solutions.","BlackRock remains intensely focused on performance. Our strong fixed income performance drove the #1 industry ranking in U.S. Retail active fixed income flows for the year where we generated more than $9 billion of net inflows in a year when the industry saw outflows of $30 billion. These changes in investor preference for income go beyond Retail and drove a strong rotation within fixed income that we anticipated will continue. And already in 2014, we are seeing accelerated interest in this area.","Unlike many of our peers, BlackRock saw fixed income inflows throughout the year in 2013, and we expect to see substantial money in motion within fixed income this year. And BlackRock's best-in-class 5-year performance track record across our bond platform puts us in a position to capture those flows. Our unconstrained bond solution SIO continues to generate strong interest from both Retail and now a much growing interest from our Institutional clients as investors reassess their duration risk and the maturity risk in their core bond portfolios.","BlackRock's actively managed business is essential to our future growth as we look to generate alpha for our clients. If you look at our performance tables in our earnings release, you'll see the numbers are quite impressive. Taxable fixed income now has 87% of its assets above benchmark for the 3-year period, up more than 30 percentage points since 2010. Our scientific active equity team has 96% of our assets above the benchmark, almost 70 percentage points since 2010. Our Fundamental Active Equity numbers are improving but are still held down by our Equity Dividend Fund, which isn't really a benchmark-driven product. And if you strip that out, you'll see that more than 67% of our active equity funds are above the benchmark for a 3-year period.","As noted before, we've made important changes to our Fundamental Active Equity teams in 2012 and '13 to ensure that BlackRock meets our clients' high performance standards, and we're beginning to see results with the 4 largest funds under new management showing material performance improvement since the new team joined BlackRock.","Our basic value fund is more than 540 basis points above its benchmark and is in the fifth percentile. Our Large Cap Growth product has risen from the 75th percentile to the 30th percentile. And our Large Cap Value product has risen from the 97th percentile to the 35th. But active management isn't just about traditional long only products. BlackRock generated $561 million in performance fees this year, primarily as a result of delivering substantial return for clients invested in our highly diversified $110 billion of alternative franchise.","We're seeing Institutional clients increase allocation to alternatives, and we've seen strong fundraising in our illiquid product set. BlackRock raised more than $6 billion in new commitments across a variety of strategies including opportunistic credit, infrastructure debt and customized alternative solutions in 2013. Our Retail liquid alternatives raised nearly $5 billion this year, and we have the right investment teams and the right distribution presence to play a leading role in Retail alternatives.","We're seeing the trend of clients are using our active and alternative strategies alongside our passive offerings continuing. BlackRock's combination of alpha and beta on a single platform and the ability to leverage our Aladdin risk management platform positions us, as well as any firm, to offer custom solutions across the investment spectrum for our clients.","On the passive side, it was another strong year for iShares, generating $64 billion of net inflows and 8% organic growth rate. Secular trends supporting future ETF growth remains. These include increasing adoption of global penetration; expanding the usage of ETFs as a core building block; and three, as investor demand for innovative new products. As Gary mentioned, our iShares Core Series is one example of BlackRock's ability to expand our reach into new segments like buy-and-hold space.","Since the launch of the Core Series in October 2012, we've raised nearly $25 billion, representing a 30% annualized organic growth. BlackRock's strategic alliance with Fidelity, which we enhanced in 2013, is another example of our commitment to buy-and-hold investors. And we saw organic growth of 15% in 2013, nearly doubling that of our overall iShares business. While we saw strong iShares equity flows in 2013, it was a challenging year for long-duration fixed income and ETFs. The interest rate environment led many liquidity-oriented investors to sell long-duration assets, which made up more than 70% of our iShares fixed income book. As a result, we saw more than $7 billion of fixed income outflows this year, a sizable reversal for the iSharesBond business from a strong 2012.","Helping to offset the pressure on the long-duration side, our short-duration fixed income suite gathered nearly $9 billion this year, led by our floating rate bond fund. BlackRock is focused on strengthening our offerings for clients, seeking protection in a rising rate environment, by offering expanding product set that includes 4 new U.S. funds, including short duration versions of our flagship high-yield and our investment-grade credit products and short maturity and liquidity income funds.","Fixed income ETFs represent a sizable long-term growth opportunity for BlackRock. And with diverse offerings in long and short durations and fixed maturity products, I believe BlackRock is very well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.","I've spent a lot of time in 2013 talking to clients, talking to shareholders, talking to regulators and politicians about longevity. Longer lifespans and underfunded retirement plans are one of the defining investment challenges of our generation. BlackRock is committed to helping clients meet their retirement savings needs, and our ability to customize outcome-oriented solutions is a key differentiator. In 2013, BlackRock's Defined Contribution clients contributed $30 billion of net inflows for a 7% organic growth rate, taking our Defined Contribution franchise to over $525 billion, putting us as the fourth largest in the DC industry.","We continue to see substantial appetite for the target -- for our target date fundings and offerings. BlackRock launched the industry's first target date product 20 years ago, and our LifePath franchise has a strong track record through market cycles and continues to evolve to meet the needs of our clients. The BlackRock LifePath franchise is the third largest in the target date industry at over $100 billion in AUM with over $23 billion of net flows for the year, a 38% organic growth rate. This franchise is important to BlackRock's position and trajectory in the Defined Contribution market. And we recognize the responsibility that comes with more than 8 million individual investors and clients investing in our LifePath products.","And while we're very pleased with our Defined Contribution group's results in 2013, we want to sharpen our focus on retirement solutions for individual investors. So we're forming a dedicated retirement group in the United States. Chip Castille at BlackRock will be leading this group, in addition to his current role as head of our Defined Contribution business. Chip and his new team is leveraging their expertise in this category, will help BlackRock tackle retirement not just through individual product but as a suite of investment solutions for all our clients, whether they are building their retirement savings or spending for their longer lives.","BlackRock is focused on anticipating our client's needs in these challenging markets and delivering unique solutions. The benefit of a diversified business model we built, our focus on risk management and technology and our partnership approach to achieving outcomes for our clients drove our results in 2013. This past year marked BlackRock's 25th anniversary. And we reached a number of milestones, including crossing the $4 trillion long-term AUM threshold and the $10 billion revenue threshold and our hiring of 11,000 employees -- or having our 11,000 employees and importantly, funding our charitable foundation so it could be much more active in helping areas of need, especially education of financial issues and health for young people.","In 2013, BlackRock hosted our first Investor Day where we formally introduced the investment community to our deep bench of leaders at BlackRock, outlining targets and strategies for growth and made a series of firm level commitments to our shareholders.","We grew at 4.3 annualized organically for the quarter and 3.4 for the year. And we continue to believe that BlackRock will grow in the future at 5% going forward. In Retail, organic growth was 10%, ellipsing our high single-digit target. And at iShares, we grew at 8%, and we continue to believe that low double-digit growth are attainable. BlackRock's Institutional business grew at 1% in 2013. With our performance, we continue to believe that our growth rates in Institutional business will grow faster, and we're well positioned to hit our low-single digit growth -- goals going forward.","In BlackRock Solutions, we pointed to mid-teen revenue growth during the Investor Day in our Aladdin business. And in 2013, our BlackRock Solutions business delivered total revenue growth of 11%, including 13% growth in Aladdin. Finally, we laid out financial goals including a dividend payout ratio between 40% and 50%, consistent share repurchase, a minimum operating margin of 40% through the cycle and double-digit EPS growth. And BlackRock achieved each of those goals in 2013.","Looking ahead in 2014, we're committed to delivering these results for our clients and shareholders by focusing on achieving superior investment performance, enhancing our product set and distribution capabilities and continuing to understand and solve for our client investment goals. I have never been more bullish on our platform. Our unique platform of delivering alpha and beta and risk management solutions across products and across regions, no other firm has this platform to allow us to have this diversified approach to our clients.","Also, as I reflect back over our 25 years as a company, it reinforces for me the critical importance of focusing on our role as a fiduciary to our clients. Especially in today's regulatory climate, it is vital that every employee of BlackRock looks to do the right thing in every situation every day.","Finally, I want to thank our employees for the dedication and outstanding contribution in 2013 in delivering the full capabilities of BlackRock to solve for the ever-changing needs of our clients.","Thank you. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You talked about the Defined Contribution business. I think you've been one of the more successful firms with customized target date products. But your firm is not one of the integrated record keepers, which historically has been a structural disadvantage. Could you speak a little bit more about what you think your market opportunity is there and what segment of the DC market by plan size you'd be most focused on attacking?","Laurence Douglas Fink","We were very successful this year in our target dates with large plans. So that was similar growth with some very large assignments with some large players. We do not believe being a record keeper is a disadvantage for us. Actually, it allows us to be agnostic about which record keeper they use. We work with the plan. We are focusing on the clients' needs. And if they have an XYZ record keeper, we will be working with them. We are very committed in working with them. So we are the largest in Defined Contribution platform, as I said, in the U.S., with $526 billion. So we are a large player, and we're a large player, and I think you just said it, Luke, because we are willing to work on customized solutions. This is where our investment technology really gives us an advantage. And it allows us to use the technology that we have to help design Defined Contribution plans that meet the needs of the plan. Some plans may want to have their investors in a much more conservative plan. Some others would want something a little more. But we have the ability to customize the solution. And in our presentations, it plays quite well with our clients, and this is why we continue to drive, as you suggested, above-market growth rates.","Luke Montgomery - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then switching gears a little bit. I wondered if you would comment on any significant regulatory developments. I know that we've got the consultative paper from the Financial Stability Board on SIFI designations. We've seen the Volcker Rule that came out in December. And also with that, I know you've identified compliance spending on regulations as one of the ongoing pressures on expenses and profit margins. So I was hoping you could give us a sense of where we are in the spending cycle for that. Have you incurred a lot of the upfront costs? And are we -- or are we at an elevated long-term run rate?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, I thought the ROSCO [ph] Financial Stability Board's paper on a framework was a good framework. We actually agree with their framework. We actually we with the year framework. Their framework really spoke about products and how they need to look at products. This is something that we've been discussing here in the United States. As I've said repeatedly, it was not the largest institutions the asset management had that created any of the real problems. With long-term capital in the late '90s, that would not have been a large-scale platform. You had Bear Stearns asset management with a leveraged mortgage fund that created the beginning of the crisis here in the United States. And the money market crisis was created by the #9 largest money market fund that was reaching for yield, which plays into this whole concept. As you look at where risk may lie, risk is going to be lying in products. So we need to make sure that products are going to be analyzed in making sure people understand the systemic risk around products and the leverage associated with those products. Clearly, I think the ASCO [ph] plan discussed vanilla mutual funds probably don't create those types of systemic risks. Vanilla-defined benefit plans that are in core strategies are not that risky. Keep in mind, the one thing that is very -- I think regulators understand -- are beginning to understand. At BlackRock, we do have $4.3 trillion of assets. But we have thousands of clients. We have contracts that we have to live up to by our clients. And we have hundreds and hundreds of different products with different strategies. So it is not a unified platform. And I think it's more understood here in the United States and in Europe that this is not our money. This is client money. We have to live by our fiduciary standard with all these monies. And so we are working very closely with our regulators worldwide. We have constructive dialogue. And yet, nevertheless, the new regulations, whether it's Reg FD, whether it's working on disclosure items, we are spending more money on compliance. We have to have -- I think society is demanding higher fiduciary standards for all of us. And we are committed in doing this, and we are building a robust compliance process. We're spending money on technology. I'm not here to tell you we're finished investing, and I don't know how much more investing we have to do but it's -- I could say with certainty, we spent a great sum of money meeting the needs of today's, I would say, fiduciary standards.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The first question I have is, as you think about the active versus passive dynamic, what are you seeing from your clients as you look into 2014? Is there any kind of sub-rotation back into active just given what seems to be a better market backdrop? Sort of part 2 of that question is, what's your latest thoughts on getting into the fundamentally based ETF segment, which seems to be growing very rapidly?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm not sure what you mean by fundamental base. I'm going to let Rob talk about it. I still don't think it's growing that fast, so I won't agree on that. But I think there's a lot of potential there, but I don't think it's growing yet. Related to the rotation and active versus passive equities, I think questionably in the third and fourth quarter, we did see rotation out of index equities, but I'm not certain that rotation all went back into active equities. It was a -- and much of it was rebalancing. Because of the huge gains in U.S. equities, a lot of pension plans did rebalancing into fixed income. This is one thing I think so many people in the marketplace misunderstood because they focus on retail flows and bonds. But there was large flows back into fixed income as pension funds needed to rebalance. And some of that rebalancing also went into alts. We are going to be having a survey that we will be releasing related to investor preferences. I think it will be released today. And that survey showed that we're seeing large preference by institutions to be migrating more and more money into alternatives. So some of that rotation out of index went into alts. We did not see that much rotation into active. And yet, I do believe that you're going to see some rotation out of index type of -- or beta strategy equity strategies into active, especially possibly in the emerging market area where it's been so heavily depressed relative to the developed market. I'm going to let Rob talk about ETF flows.","Robert S. Kapito","So on your question, we have -- we believe transparency in the ETF market is very important to the growth both in Retail and Institutional. But we are also seeing some demand from investors that their interest is away from a specific index or benchmark. So therefore, we're targeting certain products to meet those particular, I'll call them, rules-based products. And so we've launched a couple of these, and these have been primarily in the short duration area. Some of them have to do with equity factors. Some of them have to do with [indiscernible] products. And those are less transparent because they are not against an individual index, more rule-based. So we don't see a tremendous amount of growth in what you would just call active ETFs in the index space. Where we see it is innovations where an index does not provide what the client is looking to do. We have launched several of those, and we have several more of that we're going to be launching, and they'll be based upon client demand.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Larry, I want to -- so the active -- I want to follow along, Larry, on your comment about the shift, maybe, that you sort of anticipate, you could see in EM back to active. If you look at your active equity business and you sort of try and square that with the comments around the D-style boxing or the sort of removal of constraints and be more global, when you look at your active equity product set, are you -- do you expect that you'll see some of that EM allocation to dedicated funds? Is global equity product likely to be more of a driver of that shift back to active? And then, I guess finally, where are you in sort of the process of pruning your active equity offerings?","Robert S. Kapito","So we see a huge market for us in the active equity space. Let's keep in mind that it's still a $25 trillion market, this active core space. So you have to start with performance before you can get involved. And finally, after a lot of hard work, we have now products in place that we did not have in place before with the performance that we currently have. But where we think the demand is going to be in the active space as people move more back toward from passive to active is going to be more towards unconstrained first, before they move into more of the style box. So this is where we excel because we'll be putting together more packaged products. And in the EM space, it's going to be more in, for example, in EM allocation fund. So that's where we see the money coming into the active space. We've seen it going into Global Long\/Short type product. But it's more in unconstrained first than it is in style. But we have to make sure that we all understand that the active space is still a very, very large space. And because of our performance, we hope to take market share in that particular space based on performance.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I would just add one more thing, Mark, that our Global Al product, which we had -- so we're talking about performance-related or Fundamental Equity, but Global Al had a performance issue 3 years ago. And this past year, it has great performance and is back to very strong long-term record. And as a result, we began to see some very strong flows, especially globally. I mean the big change, what we are seeing in these unconstrained products like Global Al. It historically was, I would say, 100% U.S. based. In 2013, probably 30% of the flows was overseas. And even so far in 2014, if anything, it's accelerating with more global flows. So this is not just a U.S. phenomenon. This is just not a U.S. pension fund phenomenon. More and more global clients are looking for less benchmark, less style boxed, and this is obviously a major change in both the fixed income area and the equity area.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And I guess related to that, if you look at the fixed income retail share gains that you had in 2013, I guess there's a few incumbents, if you will, in the fixed income retail U.S. area. What -- SIO has been a big driver of that, but there are other products sort of behind SIO. Should we think about, again, that sort of unconstrained fixed income being the sort of the share gain opportunity for you in that channel?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes, there's no question it's going to be like a Global Long\/Short Credit Fund. It will be credit style, and it's high yield. We have a 5-year top quartile product. It's doing quite well. We've seen large flows and high yield. We continue to believe we're going to continue to see high-yield flows this year. As I said, Global Long\/Short. And importantly, we see billions and billions of dollars moving out of core index fixed income moving into probably more unconstrained types of products. I think that is going to be the 2014 strategy. The one thing that I think, I don't know, I didn't say it today, if you look at the Barclays Aggregate Index, 87% of its risk is duration. And if you have a view that interest rates systematically will be higher over the next few years, it's a pretty hard product to be in, and yet people need to be in fixed income. I mean, you're not going to see insurance companies run away from fixed income. In fact, rising rates are very good for insurance companies. Obviously, pension funds -- as with the improving equity markets, there are some pension funds that are much closer to defeasing and getting out of equities and going entirely in bonds. And so it's wrong to think there's one tidal wave in the marketplace. There are many different divergent trends that are navigating around the fixed income area, the one area where I do believe you're going to see a reduction. And that's going to be the core base or style box fixed income products.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So I just think I'll kind of follow up on that. And I guess as you think about your outlook for fixed income, a lot of what you said is around Institutional. Can you talk about Retail where we saw outflows in 2013 and what you think we could see there from in terms of fund flows within the fixed income market?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, if you tie in my view about longevity, I have always believed Retail has overly invested in fixed income. I think this is one of the tragedies that we have in America today, that so many individual investors have been so panicked by the media, by the economic conditions, by job conditions. Much of it is reasonably understood. And as a result, so many individuals have kept their money safe as a thought and overinvested in fixed income as a safe holder. Well, obviously, if you believe interest rates are going up, it's not a safe place to be anymore. Hopefully, some of that money goes into equities. And hopefully, some of the individual investors start thinking about outcomes and long strategy investing because that's the need we need. And so if you believe that longevity continues, it is our view that so many individuals, whether it's through their IRA, their defined contribution plan, are so under-invested in the duration of their liability or their retirement needs. And so some of the investing in fixed income is probably -- as I said, was more of a place holder. And unfortunately, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we had a doubling of the S&P since 2009, was not the right place to be. But one thing I can say that I think is happening, we are seeing a convergence in how individuals and institutions think about things. However, insurance companies always have income needs. Pension funds, obviously, would all like to defease as it ever could. And so you're going to have long-term trends that are going to be constructive for fixed income. So despite the views that we may have systematically higher rates in the future, it is going to produce more demand for fixed income. And this is one of the reasons why we had such a large credit rally and why we believe that will persist. And this is why we have not been totally afraid of the realities of a changing -- the changing realities of the Federal Reserve and the manner in which they are handling their monetary policy.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, no real comments about scientific equity in your talk about flows or outlook, I assume that demand there just...","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. Well, it is somewhat really disappointing for me that we haven't seen extraordinary flows there yet. If the industry -- the quant equity industry had massive outflows, and for a couple of years, we had persistent outflows. What I can say, the negative flows have stopped, we were flat last year. We are talking to more clients than we ever had about this. I actually believe this is a -- this is one area where we're unique. This is one area where we should be growing. This is an area for us as an emphasis in 2014 with this strong performance that we have. And the strong performance is in Europe. It is in Asia. It is in the U.S. Across the global platform, we have strong, consistent performance with less equity beta. And so this is something that hopefully this will accelerate. But I will say loud and clear, I have been disappointed in the lack of flows, I am -- but I am thrilled about the team's persistence in making sure we have great performance, and we do have a positive view of our positioning going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, I just wanted to touch on the operating margin. And really, the adjusted operating margin remained above 40% really all year in '13. So I'm wondering, do you have pretty good visibility that the margin can remain north of 40% in 1Q, which is typically the seasonally softest? And then also, can you help us quantify the onetime lease expense inside G&A?","Gary S. Shedlin","Sure, Craig. It's Gary. So on margin, I think from our standpoint, we're being pretty consistent in terms of our views on margin. I think Larry mentioned the commitment we made. We're very comfortable at setting a floor on margin of the 40%. Obviously, you mentioned the first quarter tends to be seasonally soft in terms of performance fees and then payroll taxes and the like. Again, we're not managing the business on a quarterly basis to a margin. We're not actually managing the business at all to a margin. We're trying to balance both growth and profitability to come up with kind of the Goldilocks solution. We are continually looking to beta and shifts in our business mix to have positive implications, hopefully, on margin, and we're going to continue to push forward on that. So I don't think there's really any change in margin other than reaffirmation of the margin targets that we've kind of talked about. In terms of the G&A for the quarter, I think you highlighted a couple of things. You talked about lease. There's the number of items, frankly, that are elevating G&A in the fourth quarter itself. Sequentially, that's up about $76 million, which is 23%. I'd say a couple of things there. Seasonally higher marketing in the quarter definitely drove higher G&A. We've talked about that being fairly targeted over a course of a year, but we'll move quarter to quarter depending on opportunities. The lease basic cost you talked about, roughly about $12 million was in the quarter. We had some -- both non-recurring costs related to M&A but also ongoing costs associated with MGPA closing in the quarter. We had some FX that was higher in the quarter and a variety of other accruals. I think what we're trying to basically target to people is that if you exclude the impact of kind of the volatility in our marketing and promotional spend, about $15 million of the increase is really tied to our continued growth sequentially.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Really nice color there. And just as my follow-up, we're just looking for additional perspective on the open architecture glidepath product. So really, what is carrying client feedback today? Are there other competitors kind of aggressive in this market, too? And where is the AUM on that product as of December 31?","Gary S. Shedlin","So in terms of the glidepath, just we re-classed $6 billion from index equity and index-based multi-asset to better reflect the mandate that we got, again, 2 large mandates. And the $6 billion effectively reflects assets that we managed before we won the open architecture mandate. And then, if you will, there was an additional $10 billion that came our way that we are responsible for the overall glidepath, some of which we could end up managing directly, some of which will end up being allocated to third-party managers as part of our multi-manager glidepath assignment. So today, in total, that's roughly about $15 billion, $16 billion. It is a growth area that we see. And the only other point I would basically say, this is really just another way to customize for the client in an outcome-oriented manner, and it's primarily attributable to the LifePath franchise and our overall technology spend and commitment to that franchise. You should think about fees in this respect. That's also important. Fees here are generally consistent with other large institutional index mandates.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Larry, maybe just a follow-up on some of the color that you gave on allocations inflows. So I guess first, when I think about the Institutional commentary around the fourth quarter in terms of rebalancing and fixed income, that makes sense. Do you think that's more of like a transitional because of the strength in the market? And then you guys will get further on in '14, sort of the underlying trends that you've been talking about, whether it's on the alternative side, the passive side, like continue? And then on the Retail side, have you seen any of that, meaning given the strength in the equity markets, any unusual behavior of rebalancing? Or are they still too weighted towards fixed income so you're not really seeing that same trend?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Yes. So we feel we have not seen any real trend. It's consistent. I mean, if you just look at our ETF flows, as I said, $76 billion of flows into equities, $10 billion of outflows of commodity and fixed income type products. But Institutional, yes, it's really -- you generally see the big rebalancing institutionally in the fourth quarter and some people in the first quarter. In our survey that we're releasing, we did -- we heard that there's still more rebalancing but not so much. If the Institutional survey that we'll be releasing today is an indication of what the big macro trend is, more investing in alts, and so I don't think you're going to see a persistence of rebalancing out of equities into bonds. I think this is just -- as I said, it's more seasonal, especially in light of the equity run. The one thing that we should be mindful of, if we continue to have an equity rally of some magnitude, there are going to be some corporate plans that are going to defease. We're aware of 1 or 2 large plans that are above their 100% funding rate. And they are having dialogues right now, should they defease and should they just immunize their plan, their DB plan. And so you're going to have that type of behavior, too. So this is one thing that's really, in my mind, a testimonial to BlackRock's platform. We're seeing institutions go one way, we're seeing ETF players go another way, and we're seeing mutual funds being a little more balanced. And so this -- in my mind, having that ability to see the various types of investors by region and by business line or by outcome needs, we're seeing very different behaviors across the board. The beauty of our platform, we were able to capture that and understand that. And this is why we are spending so much time with our clients and trying to help them think about outcomes and not about the noise of the moment.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Laurence Douglas Fink","We want to thank everybody, obviously, thank our employees for a really good 2013. I just wanted to repeat that in our business today, we have to live with even stronger, more robust fiduciary abilities. And as I said very clearly, it is apparent as a leader in the investment management business that we set the tone. And the tone has to be strong across the board. And that is my commitment to our shareholders, that we will continue to set the tone of a strong standard fiduciary platform. And it's that standard and that tone that allows us to grow a deeper relationship with our clients. With that, thank you, everybody, and I'll talk to you at the end of the first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3212":["BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) Q1 2012 Earnings Call April 18, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Matthew J.

My name is Christie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated First Quarter 2012 Earnings Teleconference. Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.","Matthew J. Mallow","Thanks very much. This is Matt Mallow. I am the General Counsel of BlackRock. And before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks, let me point out that, during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements.","BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports which list some of the factors that may cause our results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements we make today. And finally, BlackRock assumes no duty and you should not expect that we will undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Ann Marie.","Ann Marie Petach","Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone.","Uncertain markets continue in 2012. Markets began the year strong globally, buoyed by hopes for stability in Europe and positive economic data in the U.S. However, the mood remains fragile, and some of those initial gains have sold off as confidence and mood vary with each new data point. You can see that just in the last 2 days. The initial market improvements and investor activity supported BlackRock's strong first quarter results, with EPS up 7% compared to a year ago and 3% compared to the fourth quarter. Our financial performance highlights our strong focus on our clients' needs and our ability to work with them, supported by the breadth of our product set, our global presence and our unmatched risk tools. These strengths uniquely position us to meet the diverse needs of clients in this complex and ever-evolving market.","As seen in our branding campaign, BlackRock is focusing on products and solutions that are especially important to investors in this environment, and this alignment with client needs is supporting our flows and our revenues. Our 5 client focus areas drove our net new revenue for the quarter. We expect them to be substantial contributors to organic revenue growth throughout 2012. At the same time, we saw the outflow of the previously identified $36 billion low-fee fixed income index mandate related to a single client who insourced the asset. The revenues associated with this mandate was about $4 million.","Despite starting the year behind on high-water marks, strong performance in the first quarter allowed us to maintain stable performance fees compared to the first quarter of 2011. Our cost base is benefiting from actions we took in 2011 and supporting our margin. Supported by strong cash flow, the board approved the 9% increase in our first quarter dividend and increased our share repurchase authorization back up to 5 million shares. In the first quarter, we repurchased 648,000 shares for about $125 million. The key takeaway for me is that our breadth and diversity have positioned us well for organic growth and the ability to perform well in various market environments. With that, let me quickly walk you through the results.","As I make my comments, I'll be referring to the slides in the supplement, which you can get from our website. And as usual, I'm going to be talking primarily about as-adjusted results. I've already talked about the trends, so I'm going to move us right ahead to Slide 3.","Our first quarter operating margin was 38.6%. The margin improved sequentially when you adjust for 2 items. First of all, we had seasonally high performance fees in the fourth quarter of 2011. And second of all, the first quarter had seasonally high employment taxes. Sequentially, the margin reflected the benefits of the lower base comp resulting from the restructuring we did last year, though this is partially offset by a sequential increase in marketing associated with our commitment to the brand. Our comp-to-revenue ratio of 36.2% was consistent with the long-term range of 35% when you normalize for the seasonal payroll taxes.","Taking a look at markets, as shown on Slide 4. The strong recovery in all global markets benefited every -- all asset classes since the fourth quarter, and you can see that on the right-hand column of the page. I'm focusing on average markets since the majority of our equity piece is priced daily. Then if you look at the second column in, although markets are up compared to the fourth quarter, compared to a year ago, the story is quite different. U.S. markets are up, on average, 3%, but world markets, as seen on MSCI, European markets, emerging markets, Asia markets are still between 4% and 9% below the first quarter 2011. As a result of the diversity of our equity business, about 1\/2 of our equity AUM is tied to non-U.S. markets.","These mixed market results obviously impacted our revenues compared to a year ago, so it created headwinds for us coming into the year, though new business with clients and other revenue strengths helped to buffer the headwinds associated with these market effects. I'll start with a comparison of results to a year ago then discuss results compared to the prior quarter.","On Slide 6, you can see that earnings per share of $3.16 included $3.10 of operating earnings and $0.06 of nonoperating income. EPS benefited from growth in long-dated assets, expense discipline and share repurchases.","The first quarter as-adjusted tax rate was 31.5%. This sequentially is a 0.5 point improvement and this reflected the positive effect of state and local tax legislation. And those benefits will continue for us, going forward.","Operating earnings of $825 million, which you can see on Slide 7, reflected expense discipline and improvements in long-dated base fees. Our business model benefits from the first revenue sources. We've got a revenue slide laid out for you on Slide 8.","First quarter revenues were $2,249,000,000. This includes about $2 billion of base fees, $80 million of performance fees and $123 million of BRS revenues. Flows into most long-dated products helped to drive growth in long-dated base fees. At the same time, low rates and regulatory uncertainty have been a drag on our cash products. As I mentioned before, strong performance in the first quarter allowed us to generate performance fees that were comparable to 2011. And while our performance varies by fund, the gap to high-water marks for some funds was eliminated completely and for other funds was narrowed to a couple of percentage points. We also continued to benefit from strong performance on our traditional products, which generated $28 million of the total performance fees.","BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues of $123 million were relatively stable compared to the first quarter of 2011. An almost 20% increase in our core line revenues was sufficient to offset, first of all, the non-recurrence of a larger segment in the first quarter of 2011 and, secondly, the successful disposition of assets from our advisory portfolios. The $49 billion decrease in advisory assets compared to a year ago was driven by dispositions, which have broadly benefited U.S. taxpayers. The appetite for BRS remains strong both on the lending and the advisory side, something Larry is going to talk more about.","Despite the effects of negative world equity markets, first quarter base fees, which you can see on Slide 9, on long-dated assets are up compared to 2011. This is driven by clients putting assets into income, multi-asset and index products and to an improved sec lending environment.","Just to note a few highlights. Revenues on multi-asset class products are up 11% compared to a year ago. And to put the growth of iShares revenues into perspective: The revenues are up 7% from the first quarter of 2011 and up 28% from the first quarter of 2010. The only long-dated asset class with a notable revenue decline compared to a year ago is active equity, and that is explained by the flows of quant product over the past year. Given our strong performance on these products, and really on a 3 basis -- 3-year basis, we're now 80% above benchmark. We continue to believe that this trend will reverse itself. And as a matter of fact, the quant outflows were at their lowest level in a single quarter since the BGI merger. Compared to a year ago, we also saw about a 20% decline, a little more than that, from the exodus of cash products, low yields driving that.","Looking at expenses now on Slide 10. Our expense discipline continued, combined with an absence of closed-end launches, resulting in a 3% decrease in as-adjusted expenses. In addition to the reduced launch costs, G&A benefited from lower occupancy cost as we eliminated double rents books in Princeton and London when we were moving to new locations. We also maintained stable marketing cost. This is despite the launch of our major new brand campaign, which I hope and assume everyone has seen at this point. Keep in mind that the first quarter campaign launched in late February, so reflected only one month of our actual advertising expense. This is an important long-term investment already paying off in the volume and quality of dialogue with our clients, also something Larry is going to talk more about.","Compensation expense was more than explained by an increase in base term [ph]. We have invested in the business and added great talent over the past year. Our investments were focused around ETFs, income, retirement, solutions and alternatives. These are the same themes which have resonated with our clients and generated organic revenue growth. Further, as an -- as evidence of our investment in the business, in the first quarter we closed the Claymore transaction, that's our Canadian ETF platform, and we launched 44 new iShares product.","Moving on to sequential results. Operating results were relatively stable despite seasonal factors, aided by favorable markets and a strong client response. On Slide 12, EPS improved by $0.10 compared to the fourth quarter, including $0.14 associated with improved marks on our co- and seed investments.","Relatively stable operating income of $825 million, as seen on Slide 13, reflected strong markets and seasonal factors, which I'll talk about as we continue on Slide 14, looking at revenues. Organic growth and strong markets resulted in a $114 million sequential base fee improvement, shown in the green, offset by lower seasonal performance fees, $67 million. The fourth quarters are peak locked periods for performance fees. And recall that in the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed a very large advisory assignment in BRS, accounting for the decline in BRS revenues.","As discussed earlier, the combination of strong markets and flows benefited all asset classes. Base fees are shown on Slide 15. There was particular strength in iShares resulting in revenues of $594 million and now representing almost 1\/3 of our total base fees. We did put a new slide in the supplement with the various breakouts of revenues that we thought would be beneficial to you.","We saw robust flows into both equity and fixed income iShares, specifically emerging markets and a large array of income-oriented products. Further, we saw continued strength in both asset class revenues and strength in first quarter defined contribution flows. It's encouraging to see the themes we believe to be so critical to our clients playing out in our flows and revenues as we begin the year.","I mentioned earlier, continued expense discipline. I'm now on Slide 16. The base comp benefits of our fourth quarter personnel reduction were more than offset by the seasonal effect of first quarter payroll taxes, driving that increase in comp and benefits sequentially. Direct fund and distribution expense increased with our strong asset growth. The $34 million reduction in G&A includes a $15 million increase in sequential marketing expense associated with our brand campaign that was more than offset by other cost reductions, including we had no fund launch costs in the quarter, lower occupancy expense and lower professional fees.","Non-operating income of $15 million is shown on Slide 18 and included $55 million of positive marks primarily, as you can see on our co-investments in private equity on the left-hand side and distressed credit in the middle bar. The value of the investment portfolio was up about 18%, closing the quarter at $1.2 billion, excluding hedges. The growth related primarily to seeding; included we seeded 2 new European income funds important for future growth and markets.","As a reminder, we invest alongside and align with our clients and seed new products as required for the base business, but we have no proprietary investments. Our revenues and business model are predicated on acting as fiduciaries on behalf of our client and receiving a fee for providing those services. Our balance sheet remains small, with less than $8 billion of economic tangible assets primarily composed of cash, receivables and the investment portfolio.","So wrapping up, summing up on Slide 19. We delivered a healthy margin and returned a large amount of cash to shareholders, resulting in over a 70% payout in the first quarter. Our cash flow generation allows us ample opportunity to reward shareholders consistently. Our operating cash flow in the quarter reflected both the strong operating results and also the fact that we make our annual incentive comp payments in the first quarter.","Looking ahead, we're extremely excited about opportunities we have to work with our clients in 2012 and believe we are uniquely positioned to continue helping them navigate this challenging environment. We've entered the year benefiting from our business model and client focus.","Our intense focus on delivering to clients' needs generated top line revenue growth across long-dated asset classes as clients responded to investment themes designed to benefit them in these times.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry, who'll discuss the external environment, his dialogue and what we're seeing with our clients and the ways in which we can help them navigate these markets.","Laurence Douglas Fink","Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Ann Marie. Before I talk about 2012 and the first quarter and going forward, it probably makes sense for me to reflect on how we guided to 2012 and talk about 2011 a little bit.","The volatility we saw in 2011 really froze many, many clients worldwide. Cash buildup is -- grew up throughout 2011. Investing in bonds, short-term bonds, as a means to preserve wealth was a norm for most investors worldwide. And we saw, as an overall portfolio in 2011, pronounced derisking. Although the markets had risk on, risk off, risk on, risk off, I would say the preponderance of invested -- investors worldwide added more cash in short-term bonds over the course of 2011 than they did in some incremental investing in more risk-on products.","We certainly also saw in 2011 more barbelling strategies; going into beta products, index and ETFs; and going into alternatives. And it was the uncertainty of -- from the U.S. in terms of our management of our deficits and our fiscal discipline and which was essentially the lows from the latter part of the second quarter going into the third quarter. And then we had the European crisis really coming to a real crisis in the third and fourth quarter last year.","We began to see stability in the world as the U.S. economy started showing some rays of hope that there was stability. But more importantly, the actions from the ECB with their long-term financing vehicle, LTRO, that provided the necessary liquidity to stabilize Europe. And from that, we then began to see clients starting to focus on how derisked they were.","And then going into 2012, we certainly saw large-scale clients moving from cash positions into longer-dated bonds, into credit type of products, into dividend-like equity products, all the types of themes that we are focused on in our campaign. And so overall, we saw some re-risking into the market. However, if you think about the internal generation of cash, I would still say the fears of the investor still is more overwhelming than the hope for a better future.","So we -- despite the rally in global equities from its lows, I would still qualify the market to be quite fragile. Attitudes are basically on the borderline of pessimism than optimism. And also, we are seeing this in -- from our perspective, with CEO behavior. We're still seeing most companies being very risk-adverse. I think we're going to see in the first quarter above-forecast earnings. Essentially, the reason for that is everybody is for -- is overlaying a overall view of pessimism, not optimism. And we are actually seeing performance better than that pessimistic view, and therefore, we're seeing in terms of corporate earnings, more exceeds than misses. But as we enter the second quarter, I still believe there's a great deal of uncertainty ahead of us. It is very hard for investors and CEOs and politicians to decipher between the good news and the bad news. It's very difficult for investors to have truly a long-term view. And so this growth in investing in bonds continues, cash buildup continues mostly through bank deposits, less than money market funds, as an industry. And so I don't believe that the future is much different than it has been, but it is remarkable to think about how strong equity markets were in the first quarter, with just some incremental investing in equities.","This is why, as I said October last year, as I said February this year, I still believe in equities more than ever before because we witnessed, with just some small investing, a pretty substantial rally in the equity markets. And that just is a great sign of how derisked people are. And as you look back in the first quarter, we saw large-scale repurchase of stocks from corporations, a very modest calendar of IPOs. And so as we enter the second quarter, the outstanding of equities in the world is less today than it was in January 1. And so it is -- so we're seeing CEO behavior purchasing shares back, raising dividends, all fundamentally strong foundations for a better equity market.","But let us be clear: We are not seeing major changes in investor behavior. We are seeing some re-risking. So incrementally versus the third and fourth quarter of last year, yes, we are seeing a lot more investing, but I don't believe it's to -- it's at a point where we could say the markets are going to be really strong because of a strong transition out of the cash, out of more bonds into equities. That's just not happening yet. Despite all that, BlackRock fared very well, which I'm going to talk about in a minute.","I think the U.S. economy will be and will continue to be a strength in the world economy. We believe the U.S. economy can grow between 2.5% and 2.8%. We are seeing stability in the employment market. We are seeing, incremental from the private sector, some job growth. We are still seeing some negative flow -- jobs created from the public sector. And I should remind everybody: If we ever do tackle our federal deficits, that is another way of saying we will have less jobs in our federal government as we tackle our deficits. And so we do need a robust private sector and we do need a robust job creator in the private sector. And that's going to be very important, going forward.","Volatility in the world will continue in the next few weeks. We have a serious important election in France. We have elections in the United States in November. And it's very important that everyone focus on the issues around the U.S. deficit.","We -- in our quest of trying to stabilize our fiscal discipline, we created this $1.2 trillion mandatory decline in spending beginning next year of which $700 billion will be for our military budget. This should start having an impact on our economy in the second and third quarter as, businesses that are chiefly doing business with our military and our defense, they're going to have to start focusing on what this decline in defense spending means for their companies.","And so I have spent time in watching, urging Congress to focus on this today because this is not an issue that they need to focus on in November as they think their back's against the wall. I'm trying to alert Congress today: Their back's against the wall this moment. Business behavior has to respond not as quickly as politicians but over a multi-quarter period of time, and I do believe you're going to see business behavior change as we head towards the ultimate decline in military spending if we don't address that.","One last thing, on the macro issues. I do believe oil is going to play a more significant role in terms of the outcomes in different parts of the world. I think that oil prices have a real influence on the ECB behavior. I do believe the ECB has to ease. And their interest rates are 1%, but because of oil playing a significant issue around inflation, the reluctance to ease in Europe is going to be very pronounced if we don't see a reduction in oil prices. If we can't see an oil price reduction of some magnitude, I do believe the ECB will ease, will ease aggressively, because it is our opinion that the euro has to fall in value for the southern-rim European countries to ever find growth. Right now, the southern rim politicians are constantly working on fiscal discipline, which erodes the economy, which creates greater strains on their population, greater strains on the issues of unemployment in the southern rim. And so we also need to find ways of growth in Europe and growth beyond the northern rim. If we don't find that growth, we will have more serious issues. And as I said earlier, the ECB issues is not a 3-year problem to work it out. It's a 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-year issue.","So what does this all mean for BlackRock, with all this noise? We have seen a great interest with our clients worldwide in working with BlackRock to help them in guidance with advice in terms of how they should navigate their liabilities, how they should invest in their -- to assets to meet those liabilities. So I do believe our business model today has been more valid -- never been more valid than today in terms of working with clients as they try to decipher the good news and the bad news, the push and pull of markets. And I believe we are witnessing a real large increase in this type of advice. We are certainly seeing this in the form of our BlackRock Solution area, but we are seeing this in our multi-asset class area, we're seeing that in BMACS, we are seeing that in other high-contribution business. Some of this is being manifest in increased performance in our ETF iShares platform; some of it in our, as I said, defined contribution; some of it in our alternatives business.","So excluding, as Ann Marie discussed, out this onetime previously announced outflow of a piece of index business that was out of our control, this was -- this organization portfolio was assumed by a government, and they internalized the assets.","We had approximately $25.7 billion of long-term flows, very diversified. And when I look at the environment of the world, we were very pleased with that type of organic growth across many spectrums. And it actually -- these long-term flows actually corresponded to our brand campaign, our focus areas of ETFs, retirement income, multi-asset strategy solutions and alternatives. So it validated our platform.","As our press release announced, we have approximately $3.685 trillion of assets. We witnessed over $200 billion of net growth in long-term assets to $3.34 trillion. And what I think is also interesting as we focus on BlackRock's mix: Our mix continues to increase in the multi-asset strategy area where we closed at $246 billion. We added more assets in alternatives to $110 billion. Fixed income ended the quarter with $1.244 trillion, and equities, $1.744 trillion. So once again, it's this business model of mix. It's a global business model. It's a solution-based business model that truly helped us navigate what I would call -- in a very uncertain time in the marketplace.","The other thing that I think is important to relate, especially relative to the S&P: We entered this year with below-market level of revenues because of the performance of global equities outside the U.S. in the third and fourth quarter. And so when everyone focused on the S&P, the S&P was flat. And yet, as Ann Marie discussed earlier, there were some obviously very negative market performance numbers overseas in the third and fourth quarter. We had that big hole to overcome. We did. And so this is another reason why I'm particularly proud of how we navigated in this quarter.","Before I get into some of the business highlights, let me just discuss some of the investments we made. Obviously, we're making investment in our brand. We believe our brand is becoming more and more important. It is significant for us to expand our brand. Our retail distribution partners have told us, \"You need to expand your brand.\" We need to have some demand pull instead of sell push. And we are accomplishing that. The brand recognition is growing. The types of inquiries we receive globally in terms of our brand initiative has been quite strong. It is that brand campaign that has helped us to distinguish and help our clients decipher some of the noise. It is helping them understand where they should be focusing in these uncertain times and how they can navigate higher returns and mitigate some of the associated risk.","We had more inquiry than we've ever had with our website. We had more inquiry with our telephone operators than we've ever had before, not just in the U.S. but worldwide. And so the impact is immediate. And we expect that impact to transform into sales over the course of the next few quarters and years.","So we continue to believe in this. We believe it is differentiating us. We believe we're being thoughtful, helpful. And most importantly, we want to come across as a solution provider to all our clients: from our retail clients to our largest institutional client.","The other area that we continue to invest and we will continue to invest and that is investing in our people as we see more and more opportunity to expand our platform.","As I said over multiple quarters, we are not actively looking at large-scale acquisitions. I can tell you today we are continue to not looking at large-scale acquisitions. I've never seen an environment with more companies for sale, but we have not shown any interest in doing that.","What we are doing, though, is looking for talented teams to augment our platform already. We added a emerging market debt team in Europe. We added a new head of one of our emerging market equity teams. We're adding more people across our capital markets, trading platform, marketings, communication. We're adding heavily in technology, which I'll get into in a minute, and risk in our quantitative analysis group.","The one thing that I think the world doesn't understand in terms of cost, and that's the regulatory environment. The regulatory environment continues to take shape. I don't know what this totally means for BlackRock, but we're investing large sums of money to become compliant and stay ahead of regulation. This regulation will be required for all asset managers, all hedge funds, all private equity firms. We are talking about regulations such as Form PF, which is going to be requiring reporting derivative holdings to the CFTC and to the SEC. This is a large-scale need. We all -- and this is client-by-client reporting that has to be done on a continuum. We have FACTA, which we are going to have to report. This is a big issue for our EMEA area. We have a AIFMD, the alternative investment fund management directive, in EMEA.","This is all requiring a buildup of technology. This is requiring building up more -- a larger team with our regulators. This is not just a BlackRock phenomenon. This is an industry phenomenon. This is going to be a large-scale need worldwide. One of the reasons why -- which I'll talk about it later on, why we are seeing more and more interest in Aladdin and BlackRock Solutions is because of the need for better technology, better systems. This is not just for our risk management reason, it is for reporting purposes too. Having a single technology platform is going to be imperative to properly submit all your necessary regulatory requirements to all the regulators worldwide.","And so we are trying to stay ahead of this. We are investing money and time for this, and I do believe this is going to be a very large component of how other asset managers are going to have to respond. This is -- and I just want to underscore it: This is not a BlackRock-only situation. It is an industry-wide issue. Society is looking for greater transparency, greater information. And we are staying ahead of that, making sure we are compliant with all our clients worldwide. And we do believe, because of our position, we have a higher fiduciary standard in making sure we do this as properly as possible.","Let me discuss quickly some of the businesses things. Ann Marie did a very good summary of a lot of the business issues.","Our iShares business was a standout in the quarter, with $18.2 billion in net new business, which was remarkable. This is in line with our growth in the fourth quarter. Traditionally, in the first quarter, we have sometimes outflows, as you saw big inflows in the fourth quarter and outflows in the first quarter. The whole industry saw a very large increase in the utilizations of ETFs. As I said, I think a lot of the ETF flows was related to this modest risk on client -- added risk, added beta. As they were probably mismatched and too much concentration in cash and in bonds, they added more exposure, more beta, whether it's long-term bond beta or high-yield beta or beta in equities or commodities. They did it through ETFs.","We are seeing a trend, though, of more and more investors using beta products as alpha. We are seeing more and more investors tactically allocating, using ETFs to get greater exposure to an asset category to a region, and ETFs are playing a more demonstrable role in that. I believe that will become a larger and larger component, and this is why we believe ETFs will continue to drive more and more growth.","We are still not seeing ETF's cannibalizing of the mutual fund business. The mutual fund business is slow because people are not adding risk. I'll get into ours in a minute, but it is -- I don't believe much of this is cannibalization. I believe most of the growth in ETFs are new participants in these products. Much of it is institutional, as they use beta for alpha.","The band across the ETF platform was oriented towards fixed income. For us, we had $9.4 billion of net flows. We captured 46% of the fixed income flows for the quarter. Particularly great were our U.S. and Canada iShares products growing about $14.5 billion. That was -- a lot of it was driven into emerging markets and more of our high-yield products.","Our emphasis in dividends was rewarded also in -- because we saw equity income grow. We saw high yield grow to about $8.2 billion in inflows. We also saw, as people went back into the emerging market, markets after huge outflows. In the third and fourth quarter, we had $2.7 billion of inflows in our emerging market ETF products, and now it stands to be about $40 billion.","Ann Marie suggested we closed the Claymore transaction. It was a wonderful time that it closed on and we had good flows in Canada. And more importantly, we have the dominant position both institutionally and retail in the ETF market in Canada, which we are very happy with. BlackRock -- legacy BlackRock was much stronger institutionally in Canada. The Claymore transaction really helped us on the retail side, so we cannot be more pleased with our position in Canada today. And as I said earlier, we will be looking to do in-market types of transactions like that if we could find opportunities to augment our position in different products, such as ETFs.","International iShares, we grew by $3.7 billion. We had 59% of the EMEA market, much of that was -- had to do with a lot of market participants. We're leaving the note-related or the derivative types of ETN products and moving into the physical-based products. We have the large beneficiary of that as we have aggressively discussed the attributes of physical-based ETFs versus derivative-based ETFs: the credit exposure that investors have with derivative-based ETFs.","As another example of our culture of innovation, we continue to build out more products. We added 44 new iShares products, as Ann Marie discussed, and those products have attracted already in the first quarter $700 million of new flows. And we continue to try to be as innovative as any organization.","On the retail side, we continue to see strength in the U.S. and we continue to build our presence in the U.S. So we have many participants that had outflows in the retail mutual funds. We actually in the U.S. had $1.2 billion of net long-term flows. Another example how we are building our brand, we're building our presence in the retail area.","In our European mutual funds, we had a modest $100 million of outflows. That is an example of the uncertainty in Europe and some of the uncertainty in Asia. We -- hopefully, we can stabilize our -- the businesses in Europe, but I think the European mutual fund business is going through this transition as the marketplace tries to understand what it means with the sovereign debt crisis of Europe.","In terms of institutional business, we are still seeing clients being very, very cautious. Most of our clients institutionally are -- if they're adding beta, they're adding beta mostly in passive strategies to gain that market exposure. But we are seeing some inflows in our active products. In our Americas institutional business, we had $7.7 billion of growth, which was driven $5.7 billion in our active products. A lot of that was in our multi-asset class solutions. We also had a $1 billion award of a very large international client. That is a best idea strategy for BlackRock: a huge award with a very large international client.","Our defined contribution continues to grow nicely. We had close to $10 billion of growth split evenly between active and passive strategies of which $3 billion was in our Life Path multi-asset strategy offering.","And as we discussed in our branding campaign and as we discussed in many other forums, we believe a focus on longevity is essential. We do not believe so many Americans are adequately investing for their retirement properly. We believe they are miscalculating how long they are going to live. And we have a serious growing crisis in this country in terms of meeting the needs of longevity of life. As I said in many forums, we spend so much time focusing on health. We are -- as humans are trying to find new ways of extending a life, but we're spending so little time how to afford that longevity. This is something that -- where BlackRock is trying to provide answers, solutions, hope, and I think we are beginning that dialogue with many people on trying to find that solution. But it is essential that we all -- all of us in our industry focus on the needs of financing longevity in this country. This is not, I should state, this country. This is a worldwide problem. It's just as dire in other parts of the world, too, in making sure that we are saving enough.","In EMEA, institutionally generated about $1.5 billion in inflows despite all this caution and de-risking. Particularly, that was for a large defined benefit plan. And we continue to see growth in our index strategies. But we lost about $3 billion in some of the active strategies in Europe, predominantly in U.K. equities as people de-risked in the U.K. and some of the credit strategies.","I'm particularly pleased with the first quarter growth in alternatives. We had about $800 million of net new business during the quarter, but we are involved with so much dialogue. We've never had more dialogue with our alternative strategies than we've ever had before. This is what we've been talking about over the last year or so as we are seeing clients barbelling, using beta and using more alternatives of strategy. That is persisting, that is continuing to grow. That is not just a U.S. phenomenon, that is a worldwide phenomenon.","And in Asia-Pac, we had one -- some outflows in Japan, particularly. We had $3 billion of outflows. We actually are seeing some very good inquiries in Japan right now and more opportunities, so I don't believe there's anything that is systemic about what happened in Asia.","Let me talk about BlackRock Solutions. The need for strong risk management analytics continues to drive demand for our Aladdin-based services. What's particularly encouraging: While BRS revenues were down year-over-year by $5 million, we saw a 19% growth in Aladdin revenues. So we transformed the onetime wins into long-dated, sticky revenues. So this 19% growth in Aladdin was one of the biggest growth rates we've had in the last few years. It's indicative of what we see and the opportunities we have in Aladdin. You have to remember, we had, as Ann Marie discussed, some large dispositions in our advisory business, which reduced our fees. And as we -- we also had one very large governmental assignment, onetime advisory assignment, the first quarter of last year that we obviously -- it was a onetime assignment.","So if you look at our -- the consistency of growth in the Aladdin side, this really encourage us to believe that we have huge growth opportunities going forward as we are becoming more and more as a percent of revenues being Aladdin versus the onetime advisory revenues. I'm not trying to suggest that the advisory revenues aren't good. They're wonderful, they actually -- in many cases, the onetime advisory revenues translates into an Aladdin contract. So it is a very, very important component of the BlackRock Solutions business.","The momentum is strong, as I said, in Aladdin. We won a very large assignment in Japan, another example, as we are becoming more global in this platform. We now have $12.3 trillion in the Aladdin platform that we are navigating risk for clients and providing an operating system. And that is a record level.","There has been quite a bit of noise related to the BlackRock-Aladdin trading network. Let me try to give a little more clarity about this. We are responding to the regulatory regime that is transforming the future ways of -- the sell side does business. Under Basel III, banks are going to really require you to have higher capital. Because of the Volcker Rule, banks are going to have more inhibition and some prohibition in doing principal trading. The natural outcome of that will be probably wider bid-ask spreads, and I want to underline \"probably.\"","Well, last, if we could see a narrowing in bid-ask spreads, quite frankly we don't need the Aladdin trading platform. We are doing this with the idea that we want to be the most and highest level of fiduciary to our clients. And if we are seeing a persistent widening in spreads, we believe this system will continue to be -- will flourish and grow.","And so we are doing this with our sales right now where we are trying to cross more and more trades. And through our Aladdin clients' wishes, they ask to come onto this platform. And so we are beginning the process in which we are going to be adding some clients to this platform. And what -- let me underscore it: It will only be Aladdin-based clients that are going to be permitted to go on to this platform.","For BlackRock trades, there is no commissions on this. We are not going to make -- we're not trying to become a broker-dealer. We are trying to be a fiduciary in minimizing our friction cost of trades. For our clients that are on the Aladdin system, we are going to try to charge a fee that overcomes our cost, and that is it. It is our intention through this platform in terms of revenues, hopefully, this will be another mechanism, another reason why clients want to go into Aladdin system. And if they are allowed -- if they are on the Aladdin system for risk management, they'll have access to this platform. That will be the revenue model as we design this.","But this is not going to transform BlackRock in anyway. This is not going to change our behavior, our relations with the sell side. They are going to be powerful counterparties and powerful partners for us. And so I just want to diminish this noise around this: We look at this as raising the bar as fiduciary standard. Hopefully, this will augment more Aladdin-like revenues over the course of the next few years. But let's be clear: This is a long-term, multiyear strategy. This is not unlike when we've launched the Aladdin trading -- Aladdin technology platform as a mechanism to expand our relationships with our clients.","We are going to continue to invest in our Aladdin system. I am very pleased to say that we are now winning more assignments in equities. So Aladdin system used to be only bonds, it's now in equities. So we are now having great opportunities across all our existing clients to offer the Aladdin system across all the different asset categories.","Our SMA business, although we had those onetime wins from last year and we had some dispositions for our clients, continues to generate strong returns. And we are -- we have been awarded another country assignment, which I am not going to divulge, so we're working with another European country right now. It is public that we work for Ireland, and it's been public that we've been reengaged by Ireland this quarter. It is public that we are working on behalf of the Greek central bank. It is not public related to another Central Bank assignment in Europe. So we continue to be a firm that institutions are looking for advice and help. And it's -- and it continues to drive and differentiate BlackRock for the future.","Let me just talk about some notable performance. We had very good performance at our hedge funds. We overcome some of our high-water mark hurdles in products like Obsidian. Our FIGA product continues to differentiate itself. R3 had a very good first quarter. Our Equity Dividend Fund continues to grow and continues to differentiate it. European equities, year after year, quarter after quarter, they have done an amazing job. Global allocations outperformed our benchmarks in the first quarter. That's our $8 billion go-anywhere product that Dennis Stattman runs.","Our fixed income mortgage operation had a very good quarter performance. Global Bond continues to do well. Municipal retail has had another good quarter. So overall, I would say it was a very good quarter in terms of our products, our performance and the performance in the products that we are really pushing.","Ann Marie discussed quite a bit about capital management. We are committed in increasing shareholder value through capital management decisions. We increased our dividend by 9%. We are -- we continue to repurchase shares. We have authority for a 5-million share repurchase. We continue to think and believe that we have great opportunity. We do have about $3-plus billion of free cash flow. As I said earlier in this talk, I am not here thinking that we're going to ever do a large merger again, so I would suggest that our position about using -- utilizing our free cash flow for dividend and for capital management through shares is going to be a position that we're going to take over the course of the next few years. We are very interested in, as I said, doing fill-in mergers, but we are -- with the opportunity that we have in lift-outs of teams, as we showed that we were able to do that in the first quarter, we will continue to do that too.","So overall, the first quarter was a good one. I am very proud of how we positioned ourself going forward this year. I'm remarkably excited about where we are and where we're going. I am -- I really do believe we are as well positioned as any asset manager in the world as -- we are as well positioned at BlackRock as we've been in the last 6 years with our -- we don't have mergers to worry about, we don't have a world collapse to worry about. We're focused on clients, we're focused on providing solutions for clients, and we're well positioned globally worldwide with our team to provide those solutions.","Once again, thank you. We can open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr of Nomura.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I guess the first question I have is -- Larry just mentioned the $3 billion or plus of free cash flow. The 72% payout was bigger than where you had been running the last, call it, 2 years. And just curious on if that's a high level of payout that we should expect or if 50 is your best guesstimate going forward, as you'd indicated in the past.","Laurence Douglas Fink","No. Well, no. What -- the 70-odd percent is a combination of stock repurchases and dividend. Our payout ratio of dividend is going to be between 40% and 50%. I don't want it ever to be higher. But last year, I think we paid out 120-something percent. I don't want to -- yes, it's in terms of -- so I expect it to -- I think, to be very frank, we expect to use our free cash flow opportunistically up to the board approval in terms of utilizing that free cash flow to do whatever is necessary to support a robust stock.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Fair enough. On the trading system, just curious on the basic principles of it. Is it a similar crossing network that you see in some of the equity markets where trades get done when there are same security, same price at the same time, trades crossing at the same time? And can you pre-load pre-existing trades and underneath the covers, so to speak, and wait for them to be hit? Just curious on how it's going to actually work.","Laurence Douglas Fink","I believe that is the design. That is the design of the platform. Right now, it is obviously crossing and all that as we get more and more players on it. There is going to be some transparency where the underlying desires of sellers and buyers will be.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Got it. One other question on -- the new product pipeline has been good, and you've been able to consistently launch new funds. I think you launched 4 new fixed income ETFs in April. So I guess the question is -- there's been some attention in the press to credit ETFs in terms of providing -- of promoting volatility in the markets. I'm just curious if it's gotten any regulator attention and how you feel about that because it's obviously a big growth business.","Laurence Douglas Fink","There's certainly regulatories -- reviews on all things related to ETFs at the moment. Much of it in the Europe has to do with router-based [ph] ETFs. There is obviously reviews by the FCC in the freeze in terms of leverage ETFs. They're not allowing new ETFs with any leverage to be created until they have a full review. Specifically in terms of credit ETFs, I'm not aware of any inquiry from any specific regulator. Matt?","Matthew J. Mallow","No, I'm not aware of any, either.","Laurence Douglas Fink","So look, I believe there is greater and greater demand for credit. Whether you see that in separate accounts with -- or you see it in -- or you see that in ETFs, ETFs just gives you more transparency and clarity where the market's going. But I don't think ETFs are adding any more volatility than when you see large-scale demand in any one product, whether it is a -- in physical-based securities separate account or through a publicly traded vehicle like an ETF. I cannot understand why somebody would say the ETF creates more volatility than demand than any other physical-based separate account. So I don't understand that noise, if there is such noise, and I'll just leave it at that.","Glenn Schorr - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And here's a last one, it's just on margin. There's always a bunch of moving parts, and obviously, the first quarter has the performance fee give back. But given higher asset levels and what's clear, expense control, even in the face of the marketing campaign. Any reason to think that margins won't be in and around that 39% level that you've been in for a long time?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I see no reason why, over the course of the year, margins will be consistent as they were last year. 39% is a good benchmark, 39.5%. Whatever that comes in, it should be a good benchmark. I just want to overlay the issue around regulatory issues, I was trying to be very specific on that. Regulation costs a lot of money. And so I don't want to -- I'm not here to tell you we're lowering our margin expectations, so I'm not saying that, but I am saying that we are spending a great deal of time on making sure we're compliant. And I don't believe this could be a onetime cost that's going to be very large. Once we get it routinized onto the system, it will certainly -- certainly, once we get it on the system, costs will be less. But it really depends on how we are going to be regulated and how many more people do we need to interface with regulators as regulation of asset managers increases across the board. But at this moment, I am not saying it's going to have any major impact on margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Larry, if we look at the core institutional pipeline, the sequential change there, I'm wondering if you can just comment on kind of what drove the decline there if we back out the $36 billion mandate. And also, are you seeing a mix shift in your institutional clients into ETFs out of passive mandates?","Laurence Douglas Fink","There's no question. You're seeing, for those institutions who are adding beta for tactical purposes they're doing -- a lot of institutions are using ETFs. A couple of sovereign wealth funds who historically used index funds are now using ETFs. And so yes, there is a change in mix, but it's not entirely. And our pipeline, I don't think it's sequentially that much lower, what, $24 billion. But we -- keep in mind, we are not forecasting ETFs, as you suggested, or retail in those flows and -- but there are -- you're seeing behavior change with some institutions going in using ETFs because they value liquidity more than the cost of the -- than the asset management fee. Obviously, for those clients who believe that they're going to be sitting with a beta exposure over a period of time, they will go into index funds with lower fees. But to get that liquidity, we are seeing, as I said, like, some sovereign wealth funds are using ETFs more extensively.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then on sec lending fees, the second quarter is always your seasonally strong quarter for these fees. So if we think about the changes in rates over the last year and really kind of what hedge fund activity is doing, which it seems to be another driver, how should we think about the step-up in sec lending fees, which flows through management fees in the second quarter?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, we had obviously a very good first quarter on this. We are seeing more hedged fund shorting stocks, looking for shares. So utilization was up in the first quarter, we -- and we still see utilization strong in the second quarter. And quite frankly, in a very short end of the curve, there's a yield curve. It's only a few basis points, but there is a yield curve at the very shortest period, a point of the -- and so a combination of utilization rates and then some yield curve. And the very shortest point of the yield curve has allowed sec lending fees to grow. Ann Marie, do you have any comments related to the first or second quarter?","Ann Marie Petach","I think that's good. We see both the seasonal effect and then some of those hopefully more secular trends both helping those revenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry of Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe you guys can talk about just the insourcing this quarter. When you look across your AUM, is there some more of that low-fee index-oriented mandates that might be at risk as you look forward?","Laurence Douglas Fink","No, we don't know of any.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then on -- Larry, on the world of fixed income in terms of the barbelling between alpha and beta strategies, if you will, can you just talk a little bit about what's happening in core and core plus and just how important credit is becoming in institutional allocations?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Well, you're -- it's very hard for extension pension liabilities to meet their liability needs with -- without having some type of income in credit strategies. But they're not going to -- they're certainly not going to do it in duration anymore with even long end being just so low in yields. So we are seeing across the board a very strong interest in credit types of strategies. We're seeing increased interest in hedge fund-like strategies in fixed income and in credit. But your -- core strategies with the treasury market being so dominant in core strategies, you're seeing more core plus interest and more credit-oriented strategies across the board, more strategies that are global in nature, emerging markets in nature. So you're seeing institutions really reflect on how they are going to maneuver out of core strategies over the course of the next 2 years. Now obviously, for those who have the luxury of having their assets and liabilities pretty matched, owning bonds is a very sensible thing to do. And that -- and so I'm not trying to suggest across the board owning fixed income or owning in treasuries is not a thing to do. Unfortunately, so many of our pension funds are sitting with very large underfunded liabilities, and they're all addressing it. And this is another reason why we're seeing more interest in dividend-related strategies, too. So it's not -- we're looking for other strategies that can produce income and, obviously, try to reduce as much beta exposure as you can. But I think, Marc, we're going to be living with this for a couple of years, in this low-rate environment. And unfortunately, this low-rate environment is a real tax on savers, on pension funds. And it's a real question, can these organizations tolerate for a couple more years? And to sit in bonds and core strategies for the next few years, is that the sensible thing to do? Obviously, your -- if you're incredibly risk-adverse, that might be the sensible thing to do, but it comes at a cost. And we are trying to identify to our clients, at -- what type of cost this is going to have on these organizations. As we heard earlier this -- in the first quarter, the average pension fund had greater mismatches as a result of market performance last year, as we saw lower rates, also their liabilities went up and their -- the value of their assets went down. So it's not a pretty picture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I apologize if you\u2019ve mentioned this, but are you guys still targeting a comp-to-revenues ratio around 34.5% or 35%?","Ann Marie Petach","Yes, we're still in that 35% range. It's a little higher in the first quarter because you get your annual bonus payment-related payroll taxes all hitting you there. So it's always a little higher in the first quarter.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then on the move to the physically backed ETFs overseas, do you feel as though that still has room to go, that you could still gain more share there? Or has that pretty much run its course at this point?","Laurence Douglas Fink","I'm not sure we\u2019re going to gain more share, but I don't think it's run its course. I think more and more people are looking at physical-based ETFs there. There is -- and we even saw one of our -- one of the derivative-based ETF players translate its business into physical base. And so I don't think it's run its course because I do believe most buyers are going to be looking for physical-based products. And I think that awareness has been getting more apparent. Obviously, we have 55% market share in Europe and so the last thing I'm going to do is forecast a higher market share.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kelly of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Larry, you'd mentioned that the discussions you were having with clients on alternative products has never been stronger. I think you said a kind of similar commentary to prior quarter and showing up in your flows a little bit more this quarter. So just wondering if you could segment your client base a little bit for the alternative interest. So which institutional clients are most interested, least interested? And how are they thinking about barbelling?","Laurence Douglas Fink","It's -- I don't -- we are winning guys with the retail platforms in -- within your organization. We have a couple of alternative strategies through the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney platform. But institutionally, really it's across the board where we're having dialogue. I would say, our penetration with foundation endowments is growing. We're seeing more participation there. We are seeing more asset opportunities with pension plans, especially in Europe. EMEA has been a very strong growth area. Hopefully, we're going to be closing one of our private equity types of strategies, a lot of participation in that in Europe. And so it is growing worldwide, our penetration is particularly strong with smaller institutions. And -- but there's not one area or one type of client that I could suggest to you that is looking to add alternatives with BlackRock. But it's -- I can say, geographically, Europe has been a particularly large area of growth for us.","Matthew Kelley - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So one follow-up from me. Just curious to get your thoughts on what we need for retail investors to truly reengage in equity mutual funds. I know you said that the markets are still skittish, and I'm sure you feel like -- the clients feel like they've been burned a couple of times in the market. So what do you think we really need?","Laurence Douglas Fink","Oh my gosh. Look, I think we -- it's all a confidence game. It's a confidence game from our politicians, we need leadership. It's a confidence game with our CEOs, we need leadership. It's confidence from the FAs to give people more confidence. In the United States, I think, as we see a stabilization in housing, which we expect to see next year, that will be a foundation for growing confidence. But the issues of trying to navigate this European situation, I think it's frightening for a lot of people just don't understand. As we are trying to show in our branding initiative that there is a huge cost of doing nothing, and we have to educate more and more people, by doing nothing and market timing, that is not a good answer. And we need to really engage everybody in talking about what type of -- in terms of individuals, what type of pool money do you need upon retirement? And how are you going to achieve that, earning very little sustaining cash? And the question is, does -- the noise of today, does that have any impact on a 30-year objective? And unfortunately, as we watch financial news on television and listening to it on the radio and reading it in print, through blogs, it's all about minutia and day-to-day strategies. And so it actually accelerates the short term-ism, but as advisors, we have to focus on focusing what the -- what your needs are, and that's what we're trying to do not with just retail -- with mutual fund buyers but we're trying to do that institutionally worldwide. And it's very important for us to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier of Deutsche Bank.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ann Marie, just on the expenses, so G&A, a bit lower. You mentioned the marketing. I think you said, this quarter it's around $15 million. And I just want to make sure we had that right. So if we run rate that, would it be another $30 million for the second quarter? And then, I guess, on the flip side, when I look at the comp, any way to size up the payroll tax impact? Because that will obviously moderate and provide some offset there.","Ann Marie Petach","Yes. I can take those all offline, but the payroll was broadly about 27 and the marketing is directionally correct. I'll talk to you more.","Michael Carrier - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Larry, if you look at recent, like, trends in the institutional part of the business and you compare that to, say, like, the past 10 years, like, what is the level of activity, meaning engagement, making decisions? Because it seems like the flows are improving but it still seems like, industry-wide, there's still a lot of uncertainty. And then just one follow-up on that trading platform. Just, if we do go the route where Volcker is more draconian, then in a good scenario for you guys and your clients, what do you guys anticipate being, like, the max of your ability to internalize, like, meaning the percentage of the volume?","Laurence Douglas Fink","To answer your first part of the question related to the activity of dialogue. Dialogue has never been stronger, but it takes a lot more time to try to get clients to move. So their behavior is more of -- one of reluctance, of fear, trepidation. But the dialogue is probably more unique than ever before. But more importantly, the dialogue is different. 10 years ago, dialogue was on a core strategy: a core fixed income strategy, a large cap strategy. Those conversations don't happen anymore. The conversations today are more about multi-asset strategy. It's about alternatives. It's about overlaying assets versus liabilities. It is much more complex. So the dialogue is longer, the timing in which people commit is much longer. Trepidation is large. And so -- and that's what I'm trying to say at the beginning. Although we have some nice market movements, we've seen some nice, long-term flows at BlackRock, there is still an overwhelming amount of reluctance. It's not a reluctance because they don't want to do something, it's a reluctance overlaying fear. Will this cost my job? How do I respond? And what we're trying to hit hard to everybody: Well, doing nothing could cost your job even more. You've got to -- we have to respond to these open issues, so -- but I think the key is the dialogue is different. It's more comprehensive: multi-asset strategy, alternative, barbelling. Much different. And I should also state, as well, if you\u2019ve looked at our pipeline, our pipeline speaks about that. Our pipeline is much heavily oriented to multi-asset strategy and a lot more alternatives. And so when you see our pipeline, you'll see more of that type of behavior and those types of dialogues. In terms of our trading platform, if Volcker Rule is more draconian, I hope it's not. That's not in our interest as investors. It may be in the interest of society. But there is a fundamental cost with that and investors are going to have to pay for that. Right now, I think we're crossing about 6% of our trades. Our hope is if we could get it up to 30%, that would be magnificent. That's a big -- a very high bar to achieve, so let's go at 1% at a time, from 6% to 7% to 8%. And obviously, we don't know the magnitude of how many clients from Aladdin will go on to it. If we ever achieve those objectives of 20% or 30% of crossing, it's going to have to mean a lot more participation with many more clients. And so -- but if it is more draconian, if markets are much wider, I think more clients will want to be part of this platform, and that will accelerate the utilization rate of the trading platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.","Neil Stratton","This is actually Neil, filling in. Larry, I was wondering if you could give us your thoughts today on money market reform and the likely outcomes.","Laurence Douglas Fink","We believe money market reform should be a fire way [ph]. We believe the industry has been reluctant to change. We need to be working with the SEC on money market reform. I've had dialogues with some of our fellow asset managers to work together on money market reform, working with the SEC. It is our position that if we do not work together with the SEC on money market reform, the FSOC committee will make it for us. And so we have been much more aggressive on addressing money market reform. We believe it's necessary for this industry to begin growing again. As we witness, the industry is shrinking every quarter. We have been isolated, though, with that opinion. We have been remarkably one of the only firms to aggressively believe that we need money market reform, working with the SEC to a sensible industry- and client-oriented solution. And so -- but I must say, in recent weeks, we have, through our dialogue, offline dialogues, with other firms, I believe there's a good opportunity in front of us to work with the SEC for money market reform. Hence, we avoid the FSOC telling us what money market reform will do to us.","That's it? Good. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for a good quarter, everyone at the firm. I look forward to talking to you at the next quarter. Talk to you later.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."],"3571":["BlackRock Inc. (NYSE:BLK) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 15, 2020  8:30 AM ET","Corporate Participants","Christ Meade - General Counsel","Gary Shedlin - Chief Financial Officer","Larry Fink - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Rob Kapito - President","Conference Call Participants","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Robert Lee - KBW","Ken Worthington - JPMorgan","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Operator","Good morning, my name is Laurie, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito and General Counsel, Christopher J. Meade. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you, Mr. Meade, you may begin your conference.","Chris Meade","Good morning, everyone. I'm Chris Meade, the General Counsel of BlackRock.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may of course differ from these statements.","As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Gary.","Gary Shedlin","Thanks, Chris. Good morning and Happy New Year to everyone. It\u2019s my pleasure to present results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019.","Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I will review our financial performance and business results. Our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as adjusted financial results, and I will be focusing primarily on our as adjusted results.","For many years, BlackRock\u2019s differentiated globally integrated asset management and technology business, including our risk management and portfolio construction tools, has proven its ability to deliver for clients and shareholders in different market environments, and that continued in 2019. A difficult fourth quarter of 2018 created a challenging start to the year, but as we noted a year ago volatile market environments create opportunities for growth at BlackRock as long as we remain disciplined to continue playing offense.","BlackRock achieved both revenue and earnings growth during 2019. Investment performance across our active products was excellent with 86%, 76%, and 84% in taxable fixed income, fundamental and systematic active equity assets respectively above benchmark or peer median for the trailing 3-year period.","We generated record net inflows of $429 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth, enabling us to once again beat our aspirational organic growth target for the fifth time in the last seven years. And we finished the year with strong momentum reporting over $129 billion in total flows in the fourth quarter.","The financial strength and stability of our operating model allows us to continuously invest through market cycles and capture growth in areas of highest client demand by technology, illiquid alternatives and iShares, especially higher growth strategic ETF segments such as factors, fixed income sustainable and megatrends. These investments position BlackRock to offer clients not simply products but comprehensive whole portfolio solutions and to generate consistent long-term growth for shareholders.","Full year revenue of $14.5 billion was up 2%, while operating income of $5.6 billion increased marginally. Earnings per share of $28.48 was up 6% versus 2018.","For the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated revenue of $4 billion and operating income of $1.5 billion, up 16% and 17% respectively from a year ago, when results were impacted by significant market volatility.","Quarterly earnings per share of $8.34 was up 37% versus 2018, also reflecting higher non-operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and reduced diluted share count in the current quarter. Non-operating results for the quarter reflected $85 million of net investment income, primarily driven by the mark-to-market valuation of our minority stake in Envestnet and higher marks on unhedged seed capital investments.","Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was approximately 18%, driven in part by discrete benefits linked to additional guidance on U.S. tax reform. We currently estimate that 23% is a reasonable projected tax run rate for 2020. The actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of non-recurring or discrete items and issuance of additional guidance on recently enacted tax legislation.","Fourth quarter base fees of $3.1 billion were up $310 million year-over-year primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta, organic growth, and higher securities lending revenue partially offset by certain strategic pricing investments. Year-over-year quarterly base fee growth of 11% lagged growth of average AUM of 16%, however, due to the ongoing impact of divergent equity beta and client preference for lower risk fixed income and cash assets in 2019.","In addition, while fourth quarter base fees were up 4% sequentially, our overall fee rate declined 0.1 basis points versus the third quarter. Full year base fees ended up 2% notwithstanding the impact of a significant global equity market decline in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","As a reminder, we entered 2019 with an annualized base fee run rate approximately 6% lower than 2018.","Fourth quarter performance fees of $239 million more than doubled versus a year ago collecting strong alpha generation from liquid and illiquid alternative products. Full year performance fees of $450 million were up 9% compared to 2018, despite a significant number of liquid alternative products entering the year below their high watermarks.","Importantly, recognized performance fees from illiquid alternatives were up significantly in 2019 and represented approximately 30% of total performance fees for the year.","Quarterly technology services revenue increased 35% year-over-year and full year revenue of $974 million increased 24%, reflecting the impact of the eFront acquisition and continued growth in Aladdin. Excluding eFront, technology services revenue grew 12% for the full year and we continue to target low to mid-teens growth going forward.","Demand remains strong for our full range of technology solutions and digital distribution tools including institutional Aladdin, eFront, and Aladdin Wealth.","Fourth quarter advisory and other revenue increased 30% year-over-year reflecting higher transition management and advisory assignments. Total expense increased 4% in 2019, driven primarily by higher compensation and G&A expense and the acquisition of eFront. For the full year, compensation expense increased $164 million or 4% primarily reflecting higher headcount, higher performance fees, and higher deferred compensation expense. Our full year comp-to-revenue ratio of 34.8% was moderately higher than 2018 as a result of the mark-to-market impact of certain deferred compensation programs in 2019 and the full year impact of retention awards related to recent acquisition activity.","Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. Fourth quarter G&A expense was up $130 million sequentially due to seasonally higher levels of marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense, and the aggregate impact of $48 million of quarterly expense related to contingent consideration fair value adjustments and foreign exchange remeasurement.","Overall, G&A expense increased 7% in 2019, reflecting higher levels of technology spend, the impact of the eFront acquisition, and $59 million of fund launch costs related to the successful second quarter close of the $1.4 billion BlackRock Science and Technology Trust II. Excluding the impact of eFront and various non-core items such as contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, and FX remeasurement expense, we estimate that our full year core G&A spend increased 2% versus 2018.","While we continually focus on managing our entire discretionary expense base, we would currently expect 2020 core G&A expense to increase approximately 5% relative to comparable 2019 levels driven by continued investment in technology and market data including sustainability initiatives and the full year impact of the eFront acquisition.","Our full year as adjusted operating margin of 43.7% was down 60 basis points versus 2018 reflecting our strategic decision to continue investing responsibly in 2019 despite the more challenging overall revenue capture environment created by last year's fourth quarter market volatility.","We continue to see strong performance in our future drivers of differentiated growth including ETFs, alternatives, technology and portfolio construction and remain deeply committed to investing responsibly for the long-term and optimizing growth in the most efficient way possible. And we are prudently using our balance sheet to best position BlackRock to achieve this success.","During 2019, we allocated over $750 million of new seed and co-investment capital to support our growth with our investment portfolio now exceeding $3 billion for the first time. We also closed the strategic acquisition to eFront which in combination with Aladdin will provide clients with an ability to seamlessly manage portfolios and risk across public and private asset classes on the single platform. And we remain committed to systematically returning excess cash to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases returning an aggregate of $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2019.","We repurchased approximately $1.7 billion worth of shares at an average share price of $414 per share taking advantage of attractive relative valuation opportunities that arose during the year. Since inception of our current capital management strategy in 2013, we have now repurchased approximately $8.7 billion of BlackRock stock reducing our outstanding total shares by 9% and generating an unlevered compound annual return of 14% for our shareholders.","At present based on our capital spending plans for the year and subject to market conditions including the relative valuation of our stock price, we would anticipate repurchasing at least $1.2 billion of shares during 2020 consistent with our guidance a year ago.","In addition and also subject to market conditions, we expect to see Board approval later this month for an increase to our first quarter 2020 dividend.","BlackRock's globally diversified investment platform combined with industry leading risk management and portfolio construction technology enables us to bring together the entire firm to partner with clients in order to meet their evolving needs.","Fourth quarter total net inflows of $129 billion representing 7% annualized organic AUM growth and 10% annualized organic base fee growth led by flows into strategic focus areas including iShares and illiquid alternatives. Full year flows of $429 billion were positive across active and indexed, all asset classes, client types and regions and reflected significant strength in fixed income and cash which accounted for approximately 85% of organic growth.","Globalize shares generated $183 billion of net inflows for the year representing 11% organic growth. Importantly, we saw momentum into year end driven by a resurgence in equity ETFs. Fourth quarter iShares net inflows of $75 billion represented an annualized organic asset growth rate of 15%. Notably in 2019, over 80% of iShares flows were driven by strategic product segments which saw 28% organic growth.","We also saw continued strength in the core segment with 15% organic growth partially offset by volatility driven outflows from precision exposure ETFs primarily in May and August. Within the higher fee strategic segment, it was a record year for fixed income ETFs where iShares is the market leader. We generated $112 billion of net inflows into iShares fixed income ETFs representing 26% organic growth.","Demand remains exceptionally strong as investors seek more efficient market access, portfolio construction evolves in wealth management and technology accelerates the modernization and electronification of the bond market. We achieved the number one share of the industry factor ETF flows with $34 billion across a diverse range of factor iShares.","During 2019, U.S. Min Vol or USMV was our largest and the industry's fourth highest asset gathering ETF capturing over $12 billion in net inflows. This is the first time a factor exposure outpaced every market cap weighted iShares ETF in terms of aggregate flows. iShares sustainable ETF lineup represents the fastest growing of our strategic segments generating $12 billion of net inflows and ending the year with $22 billion of AUM more than any other active or index firm.","During 2019, the iShares ESG Leaders Fund raised over $1 billion representing the largest equity ETF launch in the past 15 years. BlackRock generate full year retail net inflows of $16 billion outperforming the broader active mutual fund industry. Inflows were led by our suite of active fixed income products and liquid alternatives partially offset by outflows from Multi-asset World Allocation products.","Fourth quarter retail net inflows of $8 billion reflected similar trends, but also included the seasonal impact of capital gains reinvestment.","BlackRock's Institutional franchise generated record long-term net inflows of $136 billion in 2019 representing 4% organic base fee growth. Institutional flows reflects strength in fixed income, liquid alternatives and multi-asset solutions. Active net inflows of $2 billion were primarily into quantitative strategies for long-term performance remained strong.","Momentum in our illiquid alternatives franchise accelerated and we saw $14 billion of net inflows in 2019. We also have $24 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternative strategies representing a significant source of future growth and performance fees.","Finally, BlackRock cash management platforms continue to increase share by leveraging scale for clients and delivering innovative digital distribution and risk management solutions.","In 2019, we saw $93 billion of cash management net inflows across the platform including prime, sustainable, government and muni funds. Our innovative Liquid Environmentally Aware Fund or LEAF continues to see strong momentum with $1 billion of net inflows since launch earlier this year.","In summary, our 2019 results demonstrate the resilience of our platform which allows us to invest through market cycles and drive consistent and differentiated growth in a variety of markets. Our strategy is working. We will continue to invest responsibly during 2020 including in key growth areas like iShares, alternatives and technology to deliver the solutions our clients need to best position our employees for professional growth and to generate long-term returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.","Larry Fink","Thank you, Gary. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year and welcome to a new decade.","BlackRock has consistently and systematically invested for the future in preparation to meet clients changing needs by building a whole portfolio investment and technology platform providing thought leadership on the macro and geopolitical environment and innovating in areas like factors and sustainable investing. We are adapting to and driving change in our industry and building deeper more strategic partnerships with more clients than ever before. The benefits are our investments are evident in our results this morning.","We generated a record $429 billion of total net inflows for the year representing 7% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. BlackRock's result reflects the strength of our platform which is diversified across now $2 trillion in active strategies, $5 trillion in iShares and index strategies and now over $500 billion in cash strategies. We generated $226 billion of net inflows in iShares and index, we generated $110 billion in flows in active investing and we generated $93 billion in cash strategies.","Flows were positive across all client channels across all asset classes and across all regions including more than $1 billion in net inflows in each of 16 countries and in more than 71 different products. The total net new assets our clients entrusted to us in the past year equates to the level of assets under management of a top 50 global asset manager. After a dramatic fourth quarter 2018 market decline, which lowered BlackRock's AUM last year by $500 billion, we began 2019 at a challenging starting point. We entered the year with a base fee run rate that was about 6% lower than 2018 base fees. However, the successful execution of our 2019 strategy delivered revenue growth, operating income growth, earnings growth and alongside we are continuing to invest in future opportunities.","2019 was marked by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions which created volatility in financial markets, uncertainty around the U.S. and China trade negotiations, Brexit and other concerns about a slowdown in global growth all impacted investor sentiment, driving industry flows into safer fixed income and cash strategies, cash assets throughout the year.","In a late cycle dovish turn by central banks globally, monetary policy proved again a powerful tool in offsetting so much of the geopolitical risk. We saw equity markets close 2019 at record highs followed by decisive U.K. elections to move forward with Brexit. And now we have a preliminary agreement on trade that will be signed today by the U.S. and China.","The S&P 500 finished the year up 29% and yet emerging markets only rose 15%. 2019 also marked the year of milestones and transformations for the asset and wealth management industries. The ETF industry crossed $6 trillion in assets and iShares crossed $2 trillion. We still believe iShares in the industry are the early stages of growth. However, as clients are using iShares in many ways including as liquidity management, for hedging instruments, but also market access vehicles for central banks and to tactically access markets for Alpha managers. Increasingly, we are helping clients use iShares as an instrument of active returns and public markets. That's creating large and significant new market opportunities.","Sustainability reached an inflection point with more and more clients focused on the impact on environmental, social and governance factors on their portfolios. Some to better align their investments with their values and more because of the implications of financial risk and returns related to sustainability and climate change.","As I discussed in my letter to CEOs, which came out yesterday, we're entering a new era of finance, the investment risk presented by climate change are set to drive a significant reallocation of capital and companies investors and governments, we all need to be more prepared.","Throughout the year BlackRock continue to invest and further differentiated our business model. We adapted to and drive change in our industry and ultimately enabled a deeper, a more comprehensive partnership with more clients than ever before.","The benefits of our investments in strategic growth areas are clear. We saw strong flows in iShares, record flows and commitments in illiquid alternatives, record revenues and technology services in 2019 and active strategies where the industry faced muted flows. BlackRock generated $110 billion of net inflows and are active AUM is at an all time high.","Our liquid environmentally aware fund franchise is nearing $8 billion in size less than a year after our launch. And we made significant progress to lead the industry in growth areas like OCIO, factor-based and sustainable investing and regions around the world including most recently China. iShares as the ETF market leader and generated $183 billion of net inflows for the year, 57 iShares ETFs each generated more than $1 billion of net inflows and we saw record flows in fixed income and we saw record flows in Europe.","We once again captured the number one market share of 2019 in industry flows globally. Also in the United States, in Europe and in high growth segments such as fixed income ETF, factor ETFs and sustainability ETFs. We are optimistic about continued double-digit growth in iShares because we see vast new markets opening up and how clients want to use these exposures, iShares is expanding its range as a modernizing force in financial markets, nowhere is this more true than in fixed income ETFs. Fixed income ETFs will be one of the largest drivers of BlackRock's growth over the next decade.","The combination of BlackRock's history as a bond manager. Our expertise in ETFs and our industry leading technology and data capabilities has created significant differentiation for iShares. After having pioneered the first fixed income ETF in 2002, iShares fixed income AUM surpassed $565 billion and generated a record $112 billion of net inflows in 2019, compared to the previous record of 2017 of $67 billion.","While some of this has been as a result of a strong year in fixed income markets overall, we see this as a secular shift. We see this as a technology shift. We expect to reach a $1 trillion in fixed income iShares within the next five years and the growth path is going to be differentiated than equities. Growth in fixed income ETFs coming from the modernization of the $100 trillion bond market itself and from conversations of bond securities from institutions, central banks and even other alpha managers into ETFs.","More investors than ever before have used iShares factor ETF to take active risk tapping into factors as an additional source of potential return beyond strategic asset allocation. We generated $34 billion in factor flows in 2019, significantly outpacing all other index and all other active factor providers.","At the same time, we are seeing secular shifts in their regulatory and distribution landscape that is propelling more and more investors to iShares. For instance, in Europe we believe the ETF industry could double to $2 trillion over the next five years as MIFID II is driving change across a variety of business models and price transparency is focusing clients on value for money which will drive more demand for ETFs. In this region we are generating record iShares inflows of $60 billion and the industry crossed $1 trillion of AUM as ETF adoption accelerated.","And in the United States, we see independent financial advisory and direct platforms shift their strategies to eliminating transaction costs, democratization access to investing through ETFs and enabling more people to invest to reach long-term financial objectives.","We think this will be beneficial for brands like iShares that can deliver client high quality exposures with transparency, with ease of access and for good value. While, I've seen our monthly flows accelerated across these platforms since the move to commission free trading in October. Our expectation is for the benefit of these moves to play out in the coming months and years, especially for firms like us that can invest at scale and can invest for the long-term.","We also had a record year in our illiquid alternative business and momentum is accelerating evidenced by increased fundraising and fund vintages as more clients reassess their liabilities and their liquidity needs associated with them, they are taking a longer term view on the assets in their portfolio and increasing allocation to illiquid alternatives.","BlackRock generated $14 billion of illiquid alternative net inflows in 2019 up from $8 billion in 2018 and just $1 billion of net flows in 2017. Growth was driven by our infrastructure business by real estate, by LTPC and private credit. Fourth quarter illiquid alternatives results included the $1 billion close of a third global renewable power fund as well as our second and third close of LTPC in which we secured an additional $1.1 billion of commitments. Growth in our illiquid alternative business will further enhance and supported by our acquisition and integration of eFront as we leverage technology to enhance better solution we provide to our clients.","Technology remains a key differentiator for BlackRock. Any strategic growth area, technology is how we've been able to scale our business into a global, multi-asset organization we are today and it enables us to have a deeper, more resilient conversation with more and more of our clients.","Our long-term strategy is to provide technology for much of the asset management value chain as possible and make Aladdin the language of portfolios. Demand remains strong for Aladdin and our technology capabilities and we expect growth will be driven by expanding Aladdin's capabilities to existing clients, to attracting new clients, to inorganic growth, including eFront and the growth of our client's businesses as they scale themselves.","Technology services revenues of $974 billion increased 24% year-over-year and more than doubled since 2014. McKinsey Research shows that only 3% of technology startups reach $1 billion in revenues and I'm proud that BlackRock will soon cross that milestone. Our Aladdin and eFront technology is used by more than 900 clients in 68 countries, including 16 wealth managers that have 35,000 financial advisors serving millions of end investors.","The vast majority of our technology service revenues today come from our institutional Aladdin capabilities, which set the standard in investment management technology. And now with the integration of eFront, this will reinforce, our value proposition as the most comprehensive investment operating system for investors in the world.","One of the biggest future growth opportunities is Aladdin Wealth. Macro forces are impacting the wealth industry including a more challenging market environment, heightened customer expectations, more regulation, technology advancements and this is driving demand for a deeper portfolio, analytical and risk transparency, portfolio construction, product and scale. These are all core to the Aladdin Wealth value proposition. Additionally, we are seeing more and more clients using Aladdin Wealth as a business enabler. Particularly in markets such as Europe and Asia where wealth managers are using Aladdin Wealth to move their business away from transaction commissions and retrocession based revenue model to more of an advice driven model.","BlackRock's technology facilitates our ability to fulfill our purpose and helping more and more people experience financial wellbeing by building best in class tools for ourselves and for our clients, we are able to construct better portfolios and then deliver better outcomes.","Tools alone, however, are not sufficient. As I wrote about in my letter to CEOs, BlackRock like all the other investors need clear uniform and useful data on not only financial disclosure, but increasingly more uniformed and wide spread standard for sustainability disclosure, which will be vital to financial analysis and investment decision making going forward. As sustainability becomes increasingly material to investment outcomes, BlackRock is putting ESG data and analytics at the heart of Aladdin and our risk and quantitative analysis team.","We are increasingly evaluating ESG risks with the same rigor as traditional measures such as credit or liquidity risk. Client demand for sustainable products and solutions continued to accelerate. As a global leader investment management our goal is to also be the global leader in sustainable investing by incorporating sustainability at the core and how we manage risks, how we construct portfolios, how we design products, and most importantly, how we engage with companies.","As we wrote in a letter to clients yesterday, we will be making sustainability the standard for investing, including making sustainable investing more accessible to more of our investors. We intend to double our ESG offerings to 150 funds over the next two years, including sustainable versions of our flagship iShares product, so the clients have more choice for how they invest their money.","Client demand is also increasing for outsource CIO solutions as many are being asked to do more with less. BlackRock generated $16 billion of OCIO net inflows in 2019 representing a 10% organic growth, including winning the largest OCIO mandate awarded in the U.K. in recent years.","Outsourcing currently represents only $2 trillion of the $85 trillion of manage assets globally, and we believe the market will increase by 50% over the next five years.","I've talked many times on these phone calls in the past about BlackRock being one of the largest long-term growth opportunities for BlackRock. In line with our commitment to invest in operate there, BlackRock entered into a memorandum of understanding last month to explore establishing an asset management joint venture in China, which will enable us to provide more people with access to BlackRock investment capabilities.","As I said in the past purpose is using the long-term profitability. A company's prospect for growth is inextricably from how it manages sustainability and serves its full set of stakeholders and that is so true for BlackRock.","One of our greatest opportunities is to fulfill our purpose lies in our responsibility as a largest manager retired assets in the world. We estimate the two-thirds of the assets we manage are related to people's retirement, including our $1 trillion defied contribution business. We are levering the full breadth of our capabilities and scale to benefit all our stakeholders, including clients, employees and stakeholders and shareholders. Everything we do is rooted in the culture of focusing on the long-term and we are aggressively embracing change and investing to stay in front of the industry changes, but most importantly, we're investing the stay in front of our client's needs, so we could have them better prepared for their future.","The benefits of BlackRock's investments are evident in our consistent growth. Over the last three years, we've generated nearly $1 trillion of net organic inflows, 30% of revenue growth, 19% operating income growth, and a 43% total return for our shareholders. We entered 2020 better positioned than ever to serve our clients, to deliver growth for our shareholders in the years to come.","I want to thank BlackRock's employees for their commitment to upholding our culture and living our purpose, which was critical to our success in 2019. We remained focused in making sure that all our people stay true to our culture and our purpose and that is what differentiates BlackRock in the asset management industry.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thank you. Good morning.","Larry Fink","Good morning, Dan.","Dan Fannon","As you think about 2020, can you talk about the outlook for fixed income? In 2019, I think at the start of the year, you talked about rerisking within your client base, you saw big inflows, and now on the active side in the second half of the year, we've seen modest outflows. Can you just kind of level set kind of what clients are doing, your outlook for growth, and how you're positioned?","Larry Fink","Well, I think probably the biggest macro change for fixed income, beyond if interest rates go up or down is going to be the utilization of fixed and ETFs for active strategies. As I said in my prepared remarks and Gary mentioned and I'll let Rob talk about it a little more, we believe this is going to be a fundamental shift in how people use fixed income as an exposure, and they're going to be using ETFs as that vehicle for active returns. I believe this is going to be an overwhelming trend in the fixed income landscape as it's easier to navigate; it's cheaper to navigate; and importantly you provide much greater flexibility with substantially less operational risk when you use ETFs versus the myriad of thousands of bonds.","The specifics of the outflows in fixed income were very \u2013 idiosyncratic with one or two clients. We are seeing some clients, as I said, replace the what we define as an active strategy into more ETF strategies, and so it's hard to differentiate those two things as we build deeper, broader, dialogues about how to use ETFs in a portfolio setting. Rob, do you want to add more to that?","Rob Kapito","No. I would just add, in general, I think there is a common belief now that rates are going to be lower for longer, and with the amount of money that has been sitting on the sideline in cash, clients cannot afford that anymore at getting less than 1% returns, so they are more than willing now to extend out of cash into fixed income, and those are the flows that we are seeing and rather than come into individual bonds, the trend has been to use a more diversified portfolio that they can go into, and ETFs have been the beneficiary and because of BlackRock's position in fixed income, we have been the beneficiary of those particular flows, which we expect will continue into 2020.","Larry Fink","Let me just add, putting a whole year perspective because I can't respond to one quarter versus another. For the full year, we had $75 billion of active inflows in fixed income. For the full year, we had $112 billion in ETFs, and so when you put it all in perspective and then we had obviously even more in index and other types of LDI and other types of strategies. So we had a very strong year in fixed income, and one of the business propositions we provide to our clients is having a holistic conversation about how one can use ETFs in their fixed income strategy. And so, the active ETF mix is kind of harder for you to decipher, but we are having broader, deeper relationships with more clients in fixed income than ever before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee","Great. Good morning. Happy New Year, everyone. I just want to -- maybe going back to eFront, I know it's only been like seven months or eight months, but can you maybe just kind of give us a sense of how you've incorporated, may be start to monetize that, and And then maybe more broadly within Aladdin, I mean to the extent you want it to be kind of the language of portfolios, do you think you now have kind of the full set of capabilities that you need, and it's really just kind of execution or are there other aspects to the platform that you feel like you need to build out and add on to?","Gary Shedlin","So, Rob, I think that early stages are suggesting that everything we anticipated about the eFront strategic fit with Aladdin was well thought through and ultimately is going to come true. Again remember, Aladdin effectively began as more of the premier Risk Analytics and Portfolio Analytics system designed primarily to liquid. As you know, we spent a bunch of time thinking about attempting to build what we've done on the liquid side for illiquid as we thought about doing eFront. And the reality is doing eFront will accelerate that by a number of years for us.","I think clients have been very engaged with us in terms of thinking about getting and bringing their entire portfolio together on a single technology platform that allows them to basically bring the same expertise we've been doing for them for years on the liquid side. So, their illiquid to get a complete view of the entire whole portfolio that they have from a risk and analytics perspective.","We've had a strong and growing pipeline with a number of live opportunities globally. We actually won our first joint client, which we announced earlier in the year, and our expectation is that this will, that as we bring this together over the next six months to 12 months, it will continue to basically reinforce our long-term growth of low to mid-teens for the combined technology business.","Larry Fink","I would just add, the language of portfolios is becoming more and more real and we're committed to that. This is why we believe we have to add sustainability sleeves to Aladdin to making sure that our clients and our investors at BlackRock can look at the sustainability as one of the key investment risk going forward. What we did in factors and adding factor sleeves onto our Aladdin system.","I think the key that we've been doing is we are providing more content for the same value proposition, and so while we continue to drive elevated content with the same fee structure. And as what then happens is as the clients grow, we grow with them. And that has been one of the key characteristics of how we've designed Aladdin growing with our clients' needs. But as the clients now believe in more of the components of Aladdin they're putting on more of their assets onto Aladdin and so then we grow with Aladdin. And so the key characteristic is for us to continue to innovate to stay in front to be more additive.","And I'm looking back now with our eFront acquisition. I don't even know how we were able to operate without having those sleeves now and making -- we've been spending years talking about the need with our investors to have more illiquids and now we have the technology to be helping them to. And this is why we believe it's additive, not only for the Aladdin business, it is very additive for our all -- for our entire Al's business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.","Larry Fink","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Worthington","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. To follow up on that. So your annual letter, the focus on climate change. So as you did with Aladdin in risk management, are you planning or are there opportunities to leverage the expertise you're developing in sustainability to profit either by selling sustainable technology or ESG strategy solutions. In other words, can sustainability be a new Aladdin for BlackRock rather than just another element of Aladdin?","Rob Kapito","So following up on Larry's last answer, we certainly see huge opportunities in using the sustainability platform that we have for other profit centers for BlackRock and to add into our Aladdin value proposition. So what I could see coming forward would be creating new screens that others would be interested in to screen for ESG, creating specific model portfolios and models that many of our distribution networks would want to use. Potentially creating new indices in the market as people are looking for someone to take the lead and creating an appropriate indices to pinpoint specific areas of sustainability in the future and offer new products like specific ESG, ETFs and it's already working in that sustainable ETFs for iShares were the fastest growing category in 2019 and it generated $4 billion of net inflows in the fourth quarter or total of $12 billion for the year.","So I can see also adding on new products, which many of our clients would look for. So, as Larry mentioned, the value proposition of Aladdin would grow as we incorporate our platform into the Aladdin platform for other clients of Aladdin to be able to use. That's just the beginning of some of the ideas we've come up with that that we can put forward in 2020.","Larry Fink","Let me just add to that. As I said yesterday in my CEO letter and the firm's client letters, we believe sustainability and the issue is going to have a very large investment impact. For those investors investing in a long illiquid product they have to seek now in 10 years if there is evidence of climate change, how that will be impacting that investment that has a 10-year horizon. So more than ever before we have to drive analytics to help more and more clients, more and more investors understand the interconnectiveness of how climate change, the potential impact of climate change, how does that impact every single investment we have. And because of the resources of BlackRock, the scale of BlackRock I believe more than ever before if we execute on what we intend to do and we could, that's our intention.","If we execute, we have probably one of the broadest opportunities that we've ever had. I believe we will be able to differentiate ourselves more than any other firm by providing these analytics by using them on Aladdin as using them as an investment tool this can differentiate us more than any other organization. And this is a call to arms at BlackRock. This is probably the biggest project that we've worked on in years that we have embraced the entire organization and I want to underline the entire organization to be more prepared to start focusing on the analytics.","So we have better understanding, overlaying let's say imaging technology on the physical impact on the world and different elements of rising temperatures or rising water levels. By having a better understanding how insurance companies are focusing on their insurance risk and looking at areas that have potential climate risk implications whether that is from fire, flooding or other actions.","I do believe as I said in my letter, the possible changes from climate risk have serious implications in other countries that have heat issues and beyond any flooding issue, it could just be heat that's changing the output of their crops.","What does that mean for that country's GDP? Should we honor that country's debt? These are all really important things and that I don't believe the investor universe is prepared and it's the management's expectations at BlackRock that we become the leader in designing better tools and helping people navigate this uncertain sustainability future. We are really passionate about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt of Autonomous Research.","Larry Fink","Good morning, Patrick.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning, guys. On the 5% G&A growth guide, it sounds like there's kind of a lot of adjustments we should be making to 2019 to get to the base for that 5% growth, could you kind of walk through everything we should be backing out specifically?","Gary Shedlin","Sure, Patrick. I mean, I think we've been, we've tried to be pretty transparent on our definition of non-core. So just for a little perspective, I mean if you look at the fourth quarter; the fourth quarter was up about $130 million. We talked about some of the seasonality in there, but there was about $50 million of, again, what I would call non-core, in that case, it was contingent purchase price value adjustments as well as foreign exchange remeasurement. That $50 million is probably about 150 basis points of margin in the fourth quarter alone.","If you look at the full year, we had about $164 million of what I would call non-core that included $60 million plus for fund launch cost, that's already adjusted out of margin, but it also included a little over $50 million of these purchase price fair value adjustments, which is actually as those go up, it means that the businesses that we've acquired where we have contingent payments are doing better. So that's a good thing.","We had about $31 million of FX remeasurement, and there's probably of $15 million to $20 million knock in there for just deal fees related to things that we were doing during the year. So that's kind of the numbers that we would basically think is kind of a non-core. And so while we think about that 5%, we're trying to look at apples-to-apples. And remember, we also have a little bit of lift up from the year just general because we have 12 months of eFront relative to the eight months that we had in 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Larry Fink","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning everybody. So I wanted to turn discussion a little bit to pricing to Gary, I think at the end of last year we talked a little bit about potential kind of strategic reinvestments in some of the ETF as you've done in the past. Could you expand on that a little bit I guess which product categories do you guys think you could target here and how is your kind of tech enabled distribution could help block or capture AUM in product categories that I guess more sensitive to price moves?","Gary Shedlin","So Alex, it's really no different than the messaging we offered at your excellent conference at the end of the year. I think that, frankly, obviously, we'll react to pricing in various segments of our business. But the reality is, most of our strategic pricing investments are really driven towards our iShares business. And I think as we said for the most part, we have a number of criteria we need to meet in terms of when we will make those decisions. We need to see high future growth, but we need to basically see growth in particular where clients are price sensitive and if we see basically the combination of those two things, we will consider basically making pricing investments.","Since about 2016, we've invested approximately 1.5% to 2.5% of iShares revenue annually and over that period of time iShares revenue has grown very substantially roughly by 25%. And we think that in that respect as a look back that pricing investments have been good, not only for clients but honestly also for our shareholders by virtue of the positive NPV that we've delivered.","In 2019 our pricing investments were at the lower end of that range, but I would expect that we would move to a more normalized level of pricing investments during 2020 and obviously that's an important element of maintaining leadership within our iShares franchise. We know that those tend to be long-term sticky assets and revenue streams.","And we think about pricing investments no different than any other strategic investment in our company and we tend to budget them and take them into consideration as we think about making sure that we are growing or optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible.","There is no question that we think at the moment, most of the pricing will be focused on the core and likely in certain elements of more of the core related fixed income categories, but importantly I think most of the growth that we are seeing in the strategic segments that Rob mentioned earlier as well as where the client simply don't focus on price as a key decision of their buying decision in the precision instruments and importantly in the liquidity areas, those are higher fee today and those will not be a target of any of our pricing investments going forward.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Hey, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe just to hone in more time on the fixed income iShares. So far we're seeing quarter-to-date or January-to-date about $7 billion of fixed income iShares flows about -- little about $2 billion in core and about $5 billion institutional. So just talk about that institutional trend, which seems to be continuing, is it more, are you seeing it more from targeting specific allocations or our institutional managers substituting the ETFs for bonds because of the tighter bid-ask spreads that you're seeing in the ETF and do you see that latter element being a more powerful growth driver going forward.","RobKapito","Yes. So, it's both. So I think there is a lot of reallocation done and our forte because of our scale and size is to capture those institutional flows into our fixed income iShares. So one is its allocations that are being done as people have their view to the value of equity is in the value of bonds in their portfolio. And then as you know the supply and the time it takes to find fixed income and build a diversified fixed income portfolio is quite difficult and can be quite expensive. This is a very quick, convenient, less friction way, more liquid diversified way to get in.","So people have now substituted building those portfolios by simply going out and getting that portfolio on the Exchange and it is, winds up being cheaper and more effective. They are also using, we're seeing a lot of model changes and in the models that we have seen that are being used by institutions they are also targeting ETFs. And then, if they want to have any sort of precision, any sort of view on factors or any sort of view on particular areas of the market, they are able to achieve it much quicker and faster in fixed income.","So we saw that at the end of the year as the market went down and now this is the time when most institutions sit down and talk about their strategy. We've seen that continue those flows into the beginning of the year. So I think we're very positioned well to attract these institutional large flows.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?","Larry Fink","Yes. Thank you, Operator. Thank you everyone for joining our morning, and your continued interest at BlackRock.","I am proud of the progress we have made to lead the industry throughout 2019. And I can promise we will continue to invest. We will continue to innovate in the years to come. So we could be better in what we do and better to meet our clients' needs. And through that we will generate more growth. And if we continue to fulfill our purpose of helping more and more people experience financial well-being, we will be better positioned as an organization and to you, our shareholders.","Have a great start of the New Year and enjoy the next decade. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
