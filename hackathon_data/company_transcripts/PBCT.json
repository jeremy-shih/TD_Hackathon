My name is Latif and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial, Incorporated. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide one of this presentation which is posted on our Web site, peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.","Let's get started by turning to the overview for the full year on Slide 2. We are pleased with the company's financial and operating performance this year. Our results reflect further improvements in profitability and continued growth in earning assets. Full year net income of $281 million is the highest in the company's history and return on average tangible common equity was 10.2%.","Our straight-forward solutions oriented approach to banking enabled us to further expand client relationships and forge new ones as demonstrated by another year of growth in loans, deposits and wealth management assets. We continue to enhance our operating leverage during the year as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio through revenue growth as well as proactive expense management and we expect further improvement in the efficiency ratio in 2017.","We strengthened fee income generating capabilities over the course of the year through infrastructure investments and acquisitions most notably the addition of Gerstein Fisher, which was closed in early November. We also continued to strategically add talent across the organization to further drive revenue growth. Earlier in the year, we announced the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp which upon closing will deepen our presence in the New York Metro area.","Loan balances finish the year at $29.7 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion or 5% from the year ended 2015, while average balances increased 6%. We continued to benefit from the portfolios broadly diversified business mix as displayed on Slide 3. Strong results in residential mortgage, middle market C&I and mortgage warehouse lending more than offset slowing commercial real estate growth resulting from the decision to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio to focus our resources on full service relationships.","Looking longer term, our balance sheet as experienced compound annual growth -- loan growth of 8% over the past five years as a result of our successful geographic expansion focused on organic growth, investment and talent and new business initiatives. Importantly, this loan growth outweighed significant net interest margin compression. As a result on Slide 4, net interest income excluding accretion as increased at an annual rate of 7% during this time period.","For 2016, net interest income of $972 million increased 4% year-over-year driven primarily by ongoing loan growth.","On Slide 5, we can see deposit balances ended the year at $29.9 billion, an increase of 5% from 12 months ago reflecting growth in both our commercial and retail business segments. Each product line grew year-over-year with the exception of higher cost time balances, which we have successfully reduced.","It's also important to note, the overall cost of deposits declined 1 basis point for the year. Given deposits, our large component of profitability and an integral part of client relationships, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization. We have been very pleased with the success of these efforts as evidenced by an annual growth of 8% since year ended 2011.","Turning to Slide 6, non-interest income of $343 million was consistent with the prior year when adjusting for the 2015 gain on sale of our payroll services business as higher non-interest income during the year from investment management fees and insurance was offset by lower bank service charges and prepayment fees.","Despite significant industry headwinds related to bank service charges, we have been able to grow fee income at a compound annual rate of 2% over the past five years. As we continue to diversify our revenue stream. We have looked to strengthen fee income generation capabilities both organically and via acquisition. We have invested in infrastructure such as our new foreign exchange and loan syndication platforms, as well as a leading edge customer relationship management system in order to broaden our product and service offerings, strengthen relationships and drive revenue.","The recent acquisitions of Gerstein Fisher, Eagle Insurance Group and Kesten-Brown have bolstered our wealth management and insurance businesses. As such we continued to look for additional opportunities to further enhance these businesses.","We continue to be pleased with our ability to control cost. Full year expenses excluding merger-related cost were $864 million, an increase of only $3 million from the prior year primarily driven by higher regulatory assessments.","Managing expenses proactively is deeply engrained in the culture of the company. As you can see on Slide 7, this mindset has limited the increase and expenses at an annual -- average annual rate of less than 1% over the last five years. We are especially proud of these results considering that we have continued to make strategic investments and revenue producing initiatives as well as cover heightened regulatory compliance cost.","Slide 8 displays our earnings per common share since 2011. As a result of our ability to increase earning asset, strengthen fee income and proactively control cost, full year earnings per common share as increased from $0.55 to $0.92 over the period, a compound annual growth rate of 11%. We will continue these efforts to further enhance profitability moving forward.","On Slide 9, we include a snapshot of our 2016 goals, which were updated midyear compared to actual results. As you can see, we were inline with all of our goals with the exception of net interest income, which was slightly below the expected range due to marginally lower than anticipated average loan volume and yields.","Moving to Slide 10, we list our goals for 2017. We continually strive to balance and utilize six levers to create shareholder value. These levers are enhancing client focused capabilities, growing the balance sheet, maintaining excellent asset quality, diversifying revenues, controlling costs and deploying capital efficiently. As such we enter the year well-positioned across our diversified portfolio of businesses and attractive northeast footprint to further deliver exceptional service to clients and profitable growth to shareholders.","With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for full year 2017. It is important to note the following goals incorporate a full year of Gerstein Fisher non-interest income and expenses, but does not include the pending acquisition of Suffolk. Once Suffolk transaction is closed, we will update these goals accordingly.","The first goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 5% to 7%. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 4% to 6% range.","The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation or net interest margin to be in the range of 2.8% to 2.9%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 125 basis point rate increase in Fed funds in mid-2017.","In addition, we expect the current slope of the yield curve to remain essentially the same throughout the year. We expect non-interest income to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. Non-interest expenses excluding merger-related cost for the year are anticipated to be in the range of $895 million to $915 million as compared to $864 million in 2016. The range includes expenses related to six plans in the store branch openings, five of which are in New York as well as a full year of Gerstein Fisher expenses.","We also continue to build our readiness across a $50 billion asset threshold through our B50B project, which we have been discussing in detail in previous quarters. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time cost.","We expect to maintain excellent credit quality, with the provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million. We also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at the year end holding company Tier-1 leverage ratio will be in the range of 8% to 8.5% and common equity Tier-1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 9.7%. Finally, we anticipate the effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 32%.","With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack.","Our fourth quarter performance provided a strong finish to the year as evidenced by record quarterly net income of $75.9 million, an increase of 7% from a year ago. The quarter benefited from higher net interest income and continued expense control. As a result, the efficiency ratio was 59.3% an improvement of 170 basis points compared to the prior year quarter.","On a per common share basis, earnings were $0.24 consistent with the third quarter and up a $0.01 from the prior year quarter. We are pleased with these results considering that the preferred dividend paid as a result of our recent $250 million preferred stock issuance cost us $0.01 in the quarter. Additionally, the weighted average diluted common share count was higher by 3 million and 5 million shares respectively compared to the third quarter and prior year quarter.","Turning to Slide 12, net interest income increased $1.5 million or 1% on a linked quarter basis primarily driven by the securities portfolio as well as ongoing loan growth. Net interest income in the securities portfolio benefited from higher yields and a modestly lower level of premium amortization in the mortgage backed securities portfolio.","The primary offsets for these increases were $1.2 million decline in accretion from run-off in the acquired portfolio and $400,000 of higher borrowing cost.","Moving to Slide 13, net interest margin of $2.78% decreased 2 basis points from the third quarter. New loan volumes unfavorably impacted the margin by 3 basis points as the new business yield remained lower than the total portfolio yield.","In addition, higher borrowing cost reduced the margin by one basis point. These decreases were partially offset by an improvement of 2 basis points in the securities portfolio.","On Slide 14, you can see loan balances increase $377 million or 5% annualized from September 30 with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. These results mark the 25th consecutive quarter of loan growth. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $412 million. Originated loans from the commercial portfolio increased $238 million driven by growth in commercial real estate and equipment financing of $260 million and $46 million respectively.","These increases were partially offset by lower C&I originated balances of $68 million. The C&I portfolio was primarily impacted by lower mortgage warehouse balances which ended the quarter at $1.1 billion, a $107 million decrease from September 30.","Retail contributed a $174 million of originated loan growth which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $196 million partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. Residential mortgage portfolio continues to benefit from the strategic additions of seasoned residential loan officers in our newer market.","As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be of outstanding quality. The portfolio's LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent and the overwhelming majority of business retained continues to be hybrid, adjustable rate mortgages. For originated loans added to the portfolio during the quarter, the average LTV is 67% and the average FICO is 763.","We experienced declined loan runoff of $35 million this quarter compared to $46 million in the third quarter; remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $610 million.","Slide 15, shows the change in deposits since September 30. Deposits grew $205 million or 3% on an annualized basis during the quarter. While the cost of deposits was consistent with the third quarter and one basis point lower than the prior year quarter. The growth of the deposit base was primarily due to higher interest bearing checking and money market balances as well as non-interest bearing balances partially offset by a decline in higher cost time balances.","On a business segment basis, deposits in both retail and commercial increased during the quarter by $154 million and $51 million respectively.","On Slide 16, we look at non-interest income which decreased $6.6 million or 7% compared to the third quarter. During the quarter, we sold $400 million of lowering yielding short duration securities, a portion of the sale proceeds will be reinvested at higher rates and generate a greater level of income than the securities sold. The $6 million loss as a result of these sales was more than offset by $6.3 million gain from the sale of an ownership interest in a legacy privately held investment.","Insurance revenues decreased by $3 million reflecting the seasonal nature of commercial insurance renewals, which were higher in the first and third quarters of the year. In addition, lower operating leasing income and bank service charges unfavorably impacted non-interest income by $1.7 million and $1.1 million respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.6 million increase in investment management fees mostly attributable to the Gerstein Fisher acquisition in early November.","Finally, the other decline in non-interest income as displayed on the Slide was $3.7 million totaled $3.7 million. As you will recall in the third quarter, other non-interest income benefited from higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership.","On Slide 17, we illustrate the components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Fourth quarter expenses of $217.2 million declined $4.2 million or 2% from the third quarter. Included in this quarter's results were margin related costs of $1.6 million, which are reported in compensation and benefits as well as professional and outside services compared to $3.1 million in the third quarter, which were all reported in professional and outside services.","Compensation and benefit excluding merger related cost of $700,000 decreased $2.8 million primarily reflecting lower payroll and benefit related costs. Professional and outside services, excluding merger-related cost was $900,000, increased $800,000 as a result of the timing of certain project related to the income generating capabilities Jack referenced earlier.","Regulatory assessments increased $500,000 primarily due to the FDIC surcharge related to recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund. As a reminder, payroll taxes 401k matches and winter related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","On Slide 18, you can see our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 59.3% an improvement of 60 basis points and 170 basis points respectively from the third quarter and prior year quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, the improvement in this metric demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.","Slide 19 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 57 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and as continued to improve from recent quarters.","Fourth quarter net charge-offs was 6 basis points remained at a very low level and continued to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.","As shown on Slide 20, return on average assets of 75 basis points improved for the third consecutive quarter. This metrics increased 3 basis points on a linked quarter basis and was consistent with the year ago.","Return on average tangible common equity of 10.7% exceeded 10% for the third consecutive quarter and was consistent with both the third quarter and prior year quarter. Notwithstanding these results, our returns continued to be impacted by the low interest rate environment.","Turning to Slide 21. Capital levels at both the holding company and bank continue to be strong especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. We assured 250 million of preferred stock at five and five days during the quarter to enhance our already strong capital position. The issuance bolstered holding company capital ratios in the range of 80 to 100 basis points and will support continued growth.","On Slide 22, we display our interest rate risk profile to both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remained asset sensitive, so slightly less so than last quarter. We remained well-positioned for an increase in interest rate as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.","At quarter end, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based consistent with September 30, went up from 42% a year ago. The sensitivity of our assets is mostly driven by one-month LIBOR and the shape of the yield curve. As such the continuation of LIBOR rates drifting upward and the yield curve maintaining this current slope should bode well for further growth in interest income as the year unfolds.","Conversely sustained, lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide.","Before passing the call back to Jack and opening up for the questions. I wanted to point out the full year effective tax rate of 31.4%, a decrease from 33.4% in 2015 due to our continued investment in tax advantage license as well as other tax planning strategies. As Jack mentioned earlier, we anticipate our effective tax rate to be 32% for 2017.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David.","We are pleased with the company's financial and operating performance in 2016 and look forward to continued progress in 2017 as we expect further growth earning assets, improved operating leverage and enhanced profitability.","We are very pleased to have closed Gerstein Fisher during the quarter and have their employees join the People's United team. We look forward to building upon their successes to further grow the business.","The Suffolk integration process is progressing well. We continue to move towards closing the transaction. We are excited about the expected benefits of these transactions each of which further growth and strengthen our franchise in the New York Metro area.","In Massachusetts, we are extremely proud to be selected to manage the Commonwealth Core Banking services which are the primary bank account for concentrating and managing balances and dispersing funds to taxpayers, beneficiaries, employees, retirees and others.","In addition, during the quarter we opened a branch in Copley Square, a terrific location to service clients and strengthen our franchise in Boston. Both of these achievements reflect our significant commitment to serving the people of Massachusetts and the momentum that we have generated in this vibrant economy.","We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders, as today the Board declared a dividend for the 94th consecutive quarter as such the Board management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it as on the valuation of the company's shares. Therefore, it is important to once again remain both current and perspective shareholders, we will not move the company past the $50 billion threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend.","This concludes our presentation. Now, we will be happy to answer questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open up the line for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Jared Shaw","Hi. Good afternoon.","Jack Barnes","Good afternoon, Jared.","Jared Shaw","Could we just start maybe talking a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the loan portfolio with the good growth on CRE this quarter that's a little bit of a change from where we have seen in the last few quarters. Where is that in terms of geography any thoughts -- in the past you also have been pulling back from the New York City multifamily market with some of the competitors also pulling back, does that become more attractive now? If you could just give an update how you are looking at CRE right now.","Jack Barnes","Sure. Jared, its Jack. I'm not sure I heard totally but I will respond and tell me if I have got it complete but we did have a good quarter with CRE and important to note as well that we continued to have some runoffs although at the lower end of the range we had given on the New York multifamily. So we made a lot of progress actually in New York in our relationship based CRE business. And we are feeling very good about that market both in terms of the quarters performance and also as we head into 2017. It's a very strong pipeline there.","The other market I would note more significant balance will be Massachusetts. We had a solid quarter there. And again, have a good pipeline going into the first quarter here. I would say generally we have made good incremental progress building that portfolio across our markets. But those two markets would be the largest and have the most impactful.","Jared Shaw","Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the C&I side, obviously impacted by the pullback or the slowdown on the mortgage warehouse side, but apart from the mortgage warehouse business, can you give an update on the strength of the pipeline and some of the trends you are seeing on C&I?","Jack Barnes","Yes. So, you are exactly right. The pullback on the mortgage warehouse did have a big impact on our pace growing C&I. Although, we did -- I say a notable, it's not as big in the numbers. But business banking momentum is picking up across the markets and we are pleased with that. And the sentiment actually is kind of encouraging me in this time of change and the economic environment. There is a lot more dialog and activity with the -- in the small business area.","So, other than that, I would say we have had a very solid year but not robust, generally in our middle market segments. We had a very good strong year in ABL, double-digit growth. And we had kind of middle-digit 5-ish percent growth in our equipment finance businesses.","So, good progress and I would say steady and I would say we are cautiously optimistic about our -- but the Massachusetts group really did well on the C&I side in the second half of the year and stronger in the fourth quarter than the third.","And so, as we look forward I expect more progress in Massachusetts, more cross-progress across New York. The mortgage warehouse, we are not building in our guidance any increase there as you see the history the balance is up from the $500 million or $600 million range a few years ago to a $1 billion plus. But, they are doing -- they continue to do an excellent job as well as the environment is changing and the refis will slow, they continue to build relationships and they continue to be -- the group -- the bank of choice in that business and they continue to add relationships.","So, we will see how that plays out. But, again, we are not planning -- we are looking actually to see that growth in relationships will kind of balance out the change in the refi market.","And I think I have covered the landscape there. I feel really good about the sentiments from the commercial groups, it's pretty good.","Jared Shaw","Great. Thanks for that color. And then just finally maybe for David on the securities portfolio, when was the timing of that restructuring? And then what does that do to the duration of the portfolio going forward? And should we expect to see any more yield pickup from maybe the timing of that reinvestment?","David Rosato","Sure. It was done very late in the quarter. So, if you look at in the release, the ending balances versus the averages, there was a larger decline on funding. So that portfolio as I said was very short duration, so is also low yielding. We haven't reinvested yet but I think we will be executing in the early part of this quarter -- the early side of this quarter and there is a yield pick up over 100 basis points, which will allow us to most likely shrink the amount of securities we put back on the balance sheet but fully replace any income loss.","Jared Shaw","Is that yield pick up on the total balance, or is that on the incremental purchases we're looking at, picking up a 100 basis points?","David Rosato","The yield pick up would be on what we buy. So, we won't probably reinvest a smaller notional amount than we sold.","Jared Shaw","Okay. Thank you.","Jack Barnes","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies. Your question please.","Casey Haire","Thanks, guys. Yeah, so, Just one more follow-up on the loan growth outlook. Jack, it sounds like you feel pretty good on the commercial front. Is that \u2013 does that mean that we might get a little less of a contribution from the resi mortgage side, which if I look at the loan growth in 2016, it contributed almost 60% of the loan growth given a positive outlook on the commercial side, should we expect a more balanced mix between commercial and resi mortgage of loan growth?","Jack Barnes","I\u2019d say a more balanced mix in a sense resi did really, really well this year and we expect and hope that the present folks can attain that kind of pace, but \u2013 so there is couple of things that\u2019s going on. Go back, I know I\u2019ve said this before, but just \u2013 so it is important that while we do see some pullback and expect \u2013 not only do we expect, we see our pipeline starting to come down as the refis slow. We are seeing improvement in purchase numbers and we are benefiting from the -- now across \u2013 particularly Massachusetts and the New York, new mortgage origination officers that are in the markets and now have been in the markets and getting themselves established. They are veterans in the market that we\u2019ve recruited over the last few years and we expect to get volume out of those folks that we haven\u2019t had really before. Now, so we\u2019ve got some change going on there. Obviously, the refis are slowing down, but still at pretty good pace and with some economic improvement, hopefully improvement in the housing market.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. And if I look at the deposit growth guide and take the midpoint of that as well as the loan growth guide, I kind of \u2013 I have your loan-to-deposit ratio crossing over a 100, is that \u2013 are you guys okay with that? Can you just give us some updated thoughts on how you are thinking about your liquidity profile and potentially a rising rate environment?","David Rosato","Sure, Casey, it\u2019s David. So if you do the midpoint both loan and deposit growth, which roughly had almost the same starting balance. You would find a mismatch of a few $100 million. Our view would be, in the grand scheme of things, with all the unknowns as the year developed, that\u2019s not anything that\u2019s concerning to us.","Casey Haire","Okay, great.","David Rosato","You could see loan-to-deposit creep up 1% or 2%.","Casey Haire","Understood. Okay. And just on the fee guide, if I take the midpoint of that 5% to 7% or whatever it was, I\u2019m getting \u2013 you are basically implying fees of $360 million or averaging $90 million a quarter in 2017. So what is the \u2013 what\u2019s driving this growth from this sort of $84 million starting point here in the fourth quarter?","David Rosato","Sure. The number one driver would be addition Gerstein Fisher for the full year. Away from that\u2026","Casey Haire","Right. But is it Gerstein Fisher in for the majority of the fourth quarter?","David Rosato","Yeah, for two months, two of the three months and fourth quarter, full year, obviously next year. So \u2013 and then away from Gerstein Fisher, mid-to-high single digits across cash management, our other remaining investment management businesses, our customer swap business, FX business offset by really two headwinds, one is the ongoing decline in bank service charges and secondly, commercial loan prepayment fees were lighter as 2016 unfolded as the pace of refi has slowed down and I think that trend will continue into 2017.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. Just last one from me. Just trying to get a sense on share count for the year. I have in the merger math about 26.5 million extra shares. Apologizes if I miss this, but when is the \u2013 did you talk about when do you expect the deal to close and what kind of share count you expect for the year?","David Rosato","Two separate questions. I will take the first and give the second part of Jack. So share count exclusive of Suffolk, you will notice in the press release was up, ending share count is about 310 million shares. For 2017, that\u2019s the expectation.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Your line is open.","Collyn Gilbert","Great. Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen. Maybe I will just pickup right there on Casey\u2019s question about the timing of Suffolk, if you guys had any thoughts on the close there and why \u2013 interesting to me, I guess, that you choose not to include them in your outlook numbers and maybe we will just start with a little bit of color on that. And then I\u2019ve got some others.","Jack Barnes","Sure. As we \u2013 we just have a very strong tradition of not budgeting any of our deals or acquisitions until we are closed. So part of that I guess and thinking about our guidance, we are not closed yet, we don\u2019t know what the timing is and et cetera, et cetera, so it would be little difficult to do that. That\u2019s why we choose to just get it closed and we will come back to you with the impact. So having said that, we continue to move through the application process with our regulators, and I would say it\u2019s progressed well. We had a number of request of information, which is normal in the process and we\u2019ve been very timely in our response for those questions and most of that has revolved around common letters we received and we\u2019ve been very attentive to it and expect to be able to close \u2013 very hopeful we will be able to close here in the first quarter pending approval of our application. The regulators, as you know, do not share anything about expectations around the date or the decision until it\u2019s over. So we have to be attentive to the process, keeping working through it, but \u2013 and then wait for their decision.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.","Jack Barnes","I\u2019d say \u2013 maybe for a little bit more color, if you look over the last few years, deals similar to ours have taken seven to nine months and we are right in that range now.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just also tying to the outlook, what you guys have laid out for 2017, just a little bit of an uptick better kind of across the board than what you guys put up in 2016, is that a function of just what you are doing internally, is that a function of the microenvironment, I mean, maybe just talk a little bit what\u2019s kind of going into that little bit better of optimism in 2017 versus what \u2013 2016?","Jack Barnes","Sure, sorry. So, it really is internal in the sense \u2013 we\u2019ve kind of build out plans not building in if you will changes and things like economic activity and increases in GDP or what might happen in the environment, really kind of good or bad, it\u2019s really \u2013 our plans are more built around status quo, if you will, than the environment staying stable from where we are. And so, that\u2019s the framework, but we continued progress and growth because of the initiatives that we\u2019ve taken to get into new geographies as we\u2019ve talked about, bring on new talent, build the businesses, which we\u2019ve been doing steadily over time and we are optimistic as I answered earlier in our New York and Massachusetts markets and the progress and momentum that we have there and I think our partnership - even though it\u2019s not in the guidance, our partnership with Suffolk and the integration there, putting those teams together is going to be a big plus. And we have businesses like ABL this year, their growth was in the mid-teens, it\u2019s been steady for a number of years, but not that strong. They got some nice momentum. The equipment finance businesses have actually been fairly modest over the last few years, more like 5% plus or minus, but they are feeling more activity in the market in the last 60 days to 90 days. So, yeah, I would say our plans come from expectations and the conversations, and the planning that we are doing with the business lines.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","Stuff that we think we can control.","Jack Barnes","Yeah.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, that\u2019s great. Okay. And then David just a couple of sort of housekeeping questions for you. And you\u2019ve alluded this before, the end of period share count, what drove that, that increase in the linked quarter?","David Rosato","That was mostly driven by auction exercises. If you remember, we\u2019re a little over nine years from the second step where there were a lot of employee and director options that are getting within a year exercise or maturity, so the run-up in the stock reported a number of individuals the opportunity to exercise.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","And then \u2013 as well as the run-up in stock price putting more shares on a fully diluted basis in the money thereby increasing share count.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the investment sales gain, was that -- $6.3 million, was that in the wealth line?","Jack Barnes","No, other non-interest income.","Collyn Gilbert","It was other, okay. And then just in terms of Gerstein, do you have a little bit more color as to what they added this quarter on the revenue side as well as the expense side?","Jack Barnes","The revenue was $2.6 million and they closed it \u2013 not a full month of November, but most of the month, it was very early in the month, essentially two months.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then expense associated with it, I guess, maybe thinking mostly salaries?","Jack Barnes","A little bit lower than that. Yeah, and that\u2019s mostly salary.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then the outlook for the provision expense -- I know you guys \u2013 I think you guys were guiding to like a provision in the fourth quarter of $10 million to $12 million, so it obviously came in a lot lower than that. I mean is your expectation that credit just stays good and you can kind of keep the provision down at these levels, or just kind of curious how you are thinking about credit in general?","Jack Barnes","We are feeling very good about credit. And if you look at our \u2013 this past quarter, we\u2019ve had again reductions in non-performing assets, our delinquencies are down, our charge-offs continuing to be very low. Our outlook going forward is very good.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","David Rosato","Thanks, Collyn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos of J.P. Morgan. Your question please.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hello, everybody.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Steve.","David Rosato","Hi, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Couple of questions on expenses, if we look at the 2017 expense guidance, I\u2019m assuming by your answer Collyn that Gerstein is around $12 million in terms of the increase. So we are looking for expenses of somewhere between $30 million and $50 million, it seems to be a pretty big step-up in expense growth outside of Gerstein, what\u2019s driving that?","David Rosato","The number one is compensation and benefits, just that line item, which then also would include merits, new hires healthcare cost, that totals probably about $20 million, we have the FDIC surcharge that kicked in two quarters ago, ballpark, that\u2019s about $3 million, an equal pickup in occupancy and equipment, as Jack mentioned, we have six branch openings, in the guidance as well as some of the higher level of depreciation for some of the projects, the revenue initiatives that we talked about in the past several calls.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, that\u2019s [indiscernible].","Jack Barnes","Steve, obviously, we know that that is higher pace than we\u2019ve had historically and as we pointed out in the slides that our average rate of 1%, but taking on Gerstein and then growing the businesses has those higher comp levels, those were big drivers.","Steven Alexopoulos","Right.","Jack Barnes","When we play out our guidance and look at our plan, we \u2013 as we said in the comments, we expect our efficiency ratio in 2017 to improve. So we are creating operating leverage despite that plan having higher expenses.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. Jack, maybe following up on that. Do you think you could hold the efficiency ratio below 60% near-term given some of the seasonal headwinds that David ran through?","Jack Barnes","Well, if you mean near-term first quarter\u2026","Steven Alexopoulos","Yeah.","Jack Barnes","Well, in the first quarter, we will have the higher expenses that David referenced. So, will it be below \u2013 it\u2019s going to be closed, whether it\u2019s one side or the other, is my sense of that. But as I said, we expect through the year that we will have the slow incremental improvement that we\u2019ve talked about and of course unless good things happen to rates and GDP, in which case that rate hopefully improve.","Steven Alexopoulos","Right. And maybe just \u2013 go ahead David.","David Rosato","I was just going to say if you look at our results over a five\u2013year, you\u2019ve seen a steady focus by us to bringing that ratio down and you\u2019ve seen the success as well.","Steven Alexopoulos","Yeah, okay. And maybe just final one. Jack I wanted to follow-up on your comments around your dividend. Are you saying that you would not announce a deal that would take you over $50 billion unless you are given assurance you could keep the current dividend, is that what you said?","Jack Barnes","Yes.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. Thanks a lot guys. That\u2019s all I had.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to make sure I got the numbers right on the security repositioning, I think I saw, if I\u2019m looking at the right number, that securities on an end of period balance were down almost $200 million, is that right? I\u2019m just trying to get the right number to apply the 100 basis point yield improvement number.","David Rosato","The 100 basis points was \u2013 to give up on $400 million of securities that were sold, they were sold very late in the fourth quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Got it.","David Rosato","Remember, over the course of the quarter, there were other security purchases as well.","Ken Zerbe","So when you say they give up yields, so you lost $100 basis points by selling the securities and you are going to add \u2013 so I guess they go on \u2013 what \u2013 200 basis points?","David Rosato","Yeah, around that, yeah. ","Ken Zerbe","[indiscernible]","David Rosato","And what I would say in the there was the yield on the securities was one-ten, don\u2019t forget there is a funding cost against that as well. But incremental pick up, spread is slightly over 100 basis points by the time we buyback some \u2013 those securities that I\u2019m referencing specific to that transaction.","Ken Zerbe","Sorry. And to be super clear, is that $400 million that we should be investing 100 basis points higher?","David Rosato","No.","Ken Zerbe","I\u2019m just trying to get the right number to apply to the 100 basis points.","David Rosato","I would look at it as no loss in income between what we sell and what we purchase, but we will have the ability to have fewer securities on the books when you put the two sides together.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay, so should the yield is unchanged, so really it has no impact on our income statement?","David Rosato","Income would be unchanged; we would carry smaller security balance.","Ken Zerbe","Got it.","David Rosato","So if you think about, it would be additive to the margin, it would be additive to capital levels.","Ken Zerbe","Understood, not the income. Okay. Okay, great. Thank you.","Jack Barnes","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR. Your question please.","Bob Ramsey","Hi, good evening. I know you said are not looking to move pass $50 billion without support of the dividend, if for whatever reason you are not able to get that simply because a lot times regulators don\u2019t give clear indications of such things. What is the alternative plan then? Do you sort of stop below $50 billion? What do you do if you are not able to get that approval or that assurance I should say rather than approval?","Jack Barnes","Let me \u2013 I would answer that this way. We\u2019re at $43 billion, we are growing organically to $50 billion, it\u2019s going to take a number of years. And what we are expecting that we will continue to improve our profitability, bring our payout ratio down and we see in the environment that the regulators are allowing 50 banks to carry cash dividend levels that are now up to $40 billion, we are now $60 billion something equivalent in the quarter, so we are going to continue to navigate toward $50 billion maintaining our dividend with the intent that we would not pass $50 billion without that support. Meantime, we fully expect to have a much lower dividend payout ratio than we do as we\u2019ve continued to improve that as we go along.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And then I guess in terms of additional M&A once Suffolk is done, is it safe to assume that sort of until you get that $50 billion mark sort of squared away that you wouldn\u2019t want to do a deal that would take you over that threshold?","Jack Barnes","If we don\u2019t get support from the regulators to maintain our dividend.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And I guess, maybe this is a little bit more nuance, but as I\u2019m sure you are aware in New York community was not able to get a timely approval with a thought, although they did have support from regulators for their reduced dividend, they still couldn\u2019t kind of get over the finish line over the timeline they had anticipated. How do you ever sort of get comfortable with a deal being able to sort of get to the whole regulatory process when a lot of that is really outside of your control?","Jack Barnes","Well, our relationship with our regulators and our communication about our plans are in our control and we maintain very frequent and good relationships and communication with our regulators. So I understand that we would be looking for strong assurance and that would be our expectation. So I have no idea exactly what happens with the New York community in Astoria deal and I don\u2019t think anybody else does expect the folks that are there. So I\u2019m not going to draw any conclusions about that. I\u2019m going to work on People\u2019s United Bank and our regulatory relationships and our issues.","Bob Ramsey","Sure. Okay. Thank you very much.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Breese of PJ. Your line is open.","Matthew Breese","Good evening, everybody.","Jack Barnes","Good evening.","David Rosato","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Breese","All right, so just a quick question on the Suffolk deal, in terms of your initial assumptions, in terms of cost saves, accretion in EPS, dilution to book value, has any of that changed?","Jack Barnes","No, I would say the thing that has evolved is we had not built revenue synergies into the deal. And as we move through and continue to work with each other, I\u2019m very optimistic that we will benefit greatly by the integration of having the teams come together. They are already working together as a team if you will on a number of relationships and things are going very, very well. My original expectation and Howard\u2019s original expectation around the positives would be around our combination are only strengthened. We are both feeling very good about that.","Matthew Breese","Right.","Jack Barnes","And, Matt, I would only add to that, we haven\u2019t done any updates to the streets since we announced that deal, the original cost saves that we set out, we are still committed to and there will be some pluses and minuses from interest rate marks because the \u2013 interest rates have moved, but nothing that substantially changes positive economics of that transaction for us.","Matthew Breese","And what areas on the revenue front now have you more excited than when you first announced, is it fee income or loan growth capabilities, could you expand upon that?","Jack Barnes","The significant piece I would say is loan growth possibilities.","Matthew Breese","Understood. Okay. And then considering your margin guidance\u2026","Jack Barnes","Not to dismiss expectations around fee income.","Matthew Breese","Understood. Okay. And then just considering your margin expectations for the year, there is an upward bias, could you give us some color around their trajectory throughout the quarter, is this going to be a greater shift upwards in the first quarter versus later in the year or how do you expect it to go just on a more granular basis?","David Rosato","Sure, Matt, it\u2019s David. I would just point out in the first quarter because of day count, you will normally see margin contraction, but aside from that, as you noted, we are feeling a little better about the margin based on the guidance we gave out. I would think our expectation is for a gradual increase in the margin over the course of the year especially if the yield curve keeps its current steepness and we continue to get positive comments about the economy and fed intentions.","Matthew Breese","And does that margin range still hold that there is more than one fed hike this year?","David Rosato","Yes, unless those fed tightenings wound up being substantially earlier and the curve wound up being steeper, but right now we are planning one increase at midyear as we said. If there were another one in the middle of the fourth quarter, for example, it\u2019s really not going to have a big impact on the year.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And then in terms of new commercial real estate loan yields, can you give us an idea of what traditional kind of 5-year 51 paper is going on your books at now versus at September 30 and how was the increase in the yield curve translated into new loan yields?","Jack Barnes","We\u2019ve seen some modest improvement in the quarter as rates moved some, but I would say the spreads pretty \u2013 have not changed dramatically in the market and no significant to-date anyway.","Matthew Breese","Right, okay. And is that just as a function of competition?","Jack Barnes","Yeah, I mean it\u2019s just a function of market clearing price for commercial real estate these days.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And then the same question for the deposit side, have you seen any pickup in deposit competition, new promotional rates, anything like that that will change deposit side?","Jack Barnes","No. I mean it\u2019s been a very muted to know response from the banking community. The only place where deposit costs have really changed at all is in a certain component of our municipal banking deposits from the larger customers. Again, that\u2019s not a large piece of the book of business for us. That\u2019s why you saw deposit costs unchanged third quarter to fourth quarter.","Matthew Breese","Got it. Okay. And then my last one is really around the B50B, if I said that right, readiness program. It sounds like you want to complete that over the next couple of years. Is that to say that we shouldn\u2019t see any sort of sizable transactions over the next couple of years that pushes that envelope on $50 billion or gets you over it?","Jack Barnes","No, that is not to say that we continue to work on our readiness and obviously if there is \u2013 being opportunistic, if there is a compelling reason at that timeline gets accelerated for the right reason. We feel very confident that we can react to that and mange our way through that. Some of the cases is self-imposed in the sense of we are not spending money that we don\u2019t need to ahead of the curve. So for instance living will in the construction and building out of a living will before we get there doesn\u2019t make sense to us. We understand what it is, we\u2019ve studied it, but there is no reason to invest further and actually build it until the time and we would have time to do that, adequate amount of time once we pass.","Matthew Breese","Right. And then just the last one, how is the M&A landscape changed today versus pre-Trump and the run-up in a lot of bank stock valuations.","Jack Barnes","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed much at all. I think the segment moved together, so everybody's currency is stronger generally, but I don\u2019t think certainly in the last 60-days there\u2019s been a major shift.","Matthew Breese","Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the time we have for questions. I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","In closing, our fourth quarter performance provided a strong finish to the year, including record quarterly and full year net income, continued improvement in the efficiency ratio, further loan growth highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and continued strong expense management. Our straightforward solutions oriented approach to banking and combination with our expensive suite of products and services continues to differentiate People's United across the Northeast corridor. As such, we enter 2017 well-positioned across our diverse portfolio as a business to further deliver exceptional service to clients and profitable growth to shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in People's United.

Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review the third quarter of 2016 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide one of this presentation which is posted on our Web site, peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and as always we appreciate everybody joining us today. The Company's performance continue to reflect business momentum generated through our consistent solution oriented approach to banking. We\u2019ve always partnered with clients to deliver thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address their financial needs.","During the quarter, I spend time meeting with our relationship managers and their clients across the footprint. As I often do throughout the year and a very much enjoy. These visits enable me to see firsthand how well we are meeting client needs. Once again, I came away impressed with the strength of our relationships and the quality of the clients we do business with.","The feedback I continually receive is that our approach to banking differentiates us in market. The combination with our extensive suite of products and services, this approach has enabled us to deepen existing relationships and develop new ones. As a result, we have grown the loan portfolio for 24 consecutive quarters, while maintaining exceptional asset quality and over the same period nearly doubled our deposit base and increased wealth management assets under discretionary management by approximately 40%.","Now turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Our results for the third quarter reflect further improvements and profitability and continued growth and earning assets. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $74 million, which increased 8% from both the linked and prior-year quarters, as well as generated a return on average tangible equity of 10.7%.","The efficiency ratio of 59.9% reflects a continued gradual improvement in this metric and demonstrates our focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Solid growth in both net interest income and noninterest income grow revenues higher by 3% on a linked-quarter basis and 4% compared to the prior year quarter.","Expenses of $218 million which exclude $3.1 million of merger related costs, were up approximately 2% from both the second quarter and prior-year quarters, primarily as a result of higher compensation and benefits costs. In the third quarter, we continue to optimize our branch network with the clothing of four branches. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 65 branches, which were mostly traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, majority of which are more cost efficient in store branches.","We remain confident in our ability to further control costs as the mindset of actively managing expenses has become very much ingrained in the culture of the Company. The loan portfolio continued to benefit from our diversified business mix. Annualized loan growth during the quarter was 5%, particularly strong results in residential mortgage, as well as commercial and industrial lending.","On an average basis, annualized loan growth was 8%. Looking ahead, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan origination with pipelines ending the quarter at very solid levels, our current view is for the trend to continue. Our success gathering deposits was evidenced by annualized growth of 9% from the end of the second quarter, while the cost of deposits declined 1 basis point.","Recently released FDIC deposit data show our market share percentages either increased or remain consistent in each day we operate. We are particularly pleased with our continued number one market share position in Fairfield County Connecticut and the State of Vermont.","Before turning the call over to David, to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to comment on our pending acquisitions. The closing and integration processes of the Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher transactions are progressing very well. We're working closely with teams at each firm to execute our time-tested acquisition approach.","We expect to close Gerstein Fisher in early November and continue to move toward closing Suffolk, pending regulatory approvals. As a result of these integration activities over the past few months, we have come away even more excited about the expected benefits of each of these transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us.","Each of these transactions will further grow and strengthen People's United in the New York Metro area. Since the beginning of 2010, we have made substantial progress in expanding our New York franchise, both organically and via acquisitions. Over this time, we build C&I and commercial real estate teams in the New York Metro area, entered Manhattan with a branch on Park Avenue and incorporated our broader set of products and training into the branches we acquired in the 2,010 Smithtown and 2012 Citizens Branch Transaction.","Additionally, we've hired local talent that both knows the market and is well known in the market. Collectively these investments over the last six years have enabled us to significantly grow our New York loan portfolio and deposit base. This progress gives us even greater confidence in our ability to successfully continue to move our franchise forward in the New York Metro area.","With that, I will pass it to David.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3, net interest income increased $5.3 million or 2% on a linked-quarter basis, primarily driven by ongoing loan growth. Net interest income also benefited $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter and $400,000 from lower deposit costs, primarily as a result of higher average non-interest bearing deposit balance.","Furthermore, it is important to note the increase in LIBOR rate at a modest favorable impact on net interest income of approximately $1 million in the third quarter. The primary offset to these increases was a $1.4 million decline in accretion from runoff of the acquired portfolio. Net interest income was also negatively impacted by $800,000 in higher borrowing costs and $500,000 from lower yield on the securities portfolio.","Moving to Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.80% increased one basis points from the second quarter. A higher loan portfolio yield and the additional calendar day in the third quarter each benefited the margin by 2 basis points. While the lower securities portfolio yield, higher borrowing costs, collectively reduce the margin by 3 basis points.","On Slide 5, you can see loan balances increased $330 million or 5% annualized from June 30, with growth in both our retail and commercial portfolios. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $376 million. Retail contributed $234 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $249 billion, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio.","As we\u2019ve grown our residential mortgage portfolio in recent years, originations continue to be very high quality. The portfolios LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent and the overwhelming majority of business retained on the balance sheet continues to be hybrid, adjustable rate mortgages. For originated loans added to the portfolio during the first nine months of 2016, the average LTV is 68% and the average FICO is 7.62. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $142 million driven by C&I growth of $141 million.","We experienced solid production across several C&I categories, including large corporate, middle market and asset-based lending. While end of period mortgage warehouse balances of $1.2 billion were consistent with June 30, average balances for the quarter were up $117 million. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $46 million this quarter compared to $73 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $645 million.","Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment. Deposits grew $657 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the third quarter, primarily due to higher noninterest bearing and municipal balances. Commercial continue to benefit from franchise wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $755 million or 32% annualized during the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $255 million impact on quarter end commercial balances.","Retail balances declined $98 million or 2% annualized as the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, growth is expected in the fourth quarter.","On Slide 7, we look at noninterest income which increased $5 million or 6% compared to the second quarter. Insurance revenues increased noninterest income by $2.8 million, reflecting the benefit of recent acquisitions, as well as the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. Noninterest income also benefited from several categories, including increases of $1.1 million in operating lease income, $1 million from net gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans and $600,000 in bank service charges.","In addition, the $2 million dollar increase in other was driven by higher income related to a distribution from an acquired equity investment partnership. The primary offset to these positives was a $2.1 million decrease in commercial banking lending fees, primarily due to lower commercial real estate, prepayment fees, resulting from a reduced level of pre-activity in our market.","On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in noninterest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. Excluding $3.1 million of merger related costs, which are reported in professional and outside services, third quarter expenses were $218.3 million, an increase of $5.4 million or 2.5% from the second quarter.","Compensation and benefits increased $4.7 million, primarily reflecting the impact of an additional work day and higher benefit related costs in the third quarter. The higher benefit related costs were driven in part by one additional payroll in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $1.8 million and lower professional and outside services cost, due to the timing of certain projects during the quarter.","Before moving to the next slide, it is important to mention the FDIC will requiring banks with over $10 billion in assets to be responsible for recapitalizing the deposit insurance fund, which became effective on July 1. We anticipate the impact of the surcharge is expected to increase regulatory assessment expenses by $2.5 million to $3 million per annum.","On Slide 9, you can see our efficiency ratio in the third quarter of 59.9% , improved 50 basis points from the second quarter and 180 basis points from a year-ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on enhancing operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.","Slide 10 is a reminder of our exceptional credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks, and has continued to improve from recent quarters. Net charge-offs improved from already low levels to 4 basis points, the lowest level in over nine years. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.","As shown on Slide 11, return, once return on average assets and return on average tangible equity improved for the second consecutive quarter. Return on average assets was 73 basis points increased three basis points on a linked-quarter basis and was consistent with the prior year quarter. Return on average tangible equity of 10.7% increased 60 basis points in the second and 20 basis points from a year-ago. Notwithstanding these improvements, our returns continue to be impacted by the low interest rate environment.","Turning to Slide 12, capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be especially strong in light of our diversified business that. History of exceptional Risk Management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing 200 million to 250 million of preferred before year end enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. All of our regulatory ratios are above internal long-term operating target, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points to support continued growth.","On Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive, though slightly less than the last quarter. We remain well-positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel shock scenario, as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.","At quarter end, over 44% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based compared to 43% at June 30 and 41% a year-ago. Sustained lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide.","Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I wanted to point out we revised our estimate for the full-year effective tax rate, a 30.6% for the third quarter. The effective tax rate through nine-months of 2016 is 32.4%, a decrease from 33.4% for the full-year of 2015. Due to our continued investment in tax preference item. ","With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Jack for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David. In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter performance, which includes record quarterly net income improvement and the efficiency ratio to 59.9%, continued loan growth, highlighting our diverse business mix, sustained exceptional asset quality and strong deposit growth along with lower cost deposits. Our integration and closing were with Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher acquisitions are progressing very well. We are studying about the executive benefit of each of these transactions.","Continue to build our readiness for us $50 asset special, through our B50- project, and we discussed in detail last quarter. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual one-time costs. We remain committed to consistently returning capital to shareholders and today the Board declared a dividend for the 93 consecutive quarter.","As such, the Board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact that it has valuation of company shares. Therefore it is important to remind both card and perspective shareholders, not -- we will not move, the Company pass the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend.","This concludes our presentation. Now we would be happy to answer any questions that you may have? Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Q - Ken Zerbe","Okay. Thank you. Jacky you seem very positive on the growth in New York, going forward just, I\u2019m looking at the portfolio, want to make sure, obviously there has been wide growth in C&I and very literal in CRE. When you think about the opportunities in New York, is it solely a C&I kind of opportunity or would you expect to accelerate CRE growth given potentially other firms pulling back?","Jack Barnes","We are very optimistic on both parts. We have a great C&I team there and we made nearly great, I would call, study progress through that timeframe. Both are really nice team and have good customer base and I also think the Suffolk team joins and get integrated. I see a lot more progress on that front. When I think about we have, I know we mentioned now very recently the addition of Senior Executive in the New York market, and Mark Melchione and he has brought in a very experienced team and we are very excited about their progress. We had some closings already and we\u2019ve a very strong pipeline looking forward to the positive impact there. That is what we would call our traditional three book, we are looking for relationship customers that will have multiple transactions with us and deposit relationships very similar to what we\u2019ve a financial process and the rest of the franchise. So we do continue to move away from the New York year multi family, smaller transactional piece. So we see a lot of opportunity as we move forward.","Ken Zerbe","Got, understand. Okay. That makes sense. And maybe your comments about the tax rate, if right to very end there. Does that imply that tax rate is going to be lower in fourth quarter?","Jack Barnes","No, it will be in the same. 32.4%, so we were accruing at 33.5% at the beginning -- through the first two quarters and we true that up. That\u2019s all it is.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, so third quarter is a bit lower and fourth quarter is back to the full-year, I understand. Got it. Okay, and then just one last question on the merger costs. I think Suffolk is remember right with somewhere around $38 million of merger costs. Does that already include like the 3 million that you took this quarter and what\u2019s the timing of how those my comment over the next few quarters?","Jack Barnes","The $3.1 million included costs associated with both Suffolk and Gerstein Fisher. You will probably see a small amount of thoughts were order and then the restructuring charges when we close the deal, which should be first quarter.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jack Barnes","Ken, I just want to remind that, maybe give you more perspective on the New York lending, just to make sure I interpreted your question right, but we really have New York customer base that includes the customers in ABL, equipment finance, there is -- lot of business, thanking activity. So, while you had about C&I and creative you think about our total business across the New York metro area. It includes all of our business lines.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. I Understood. Yes, I think I was just mentally building like in ABL etcetera into the C&I bucket. Broadly, okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you guys.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Bob Ramsey","Hey, Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Curious first, which line items of the $3.1 million of merger charges will run through?","Jack Barnes","Went through professional and outside services.","Bob Ramsey","Got it. Perfect. And you\u2019ve mentioned the increase in FDIC assessment industry wide. Is that -- that\u2019s already in this quarter's number though? Is that right?","Jack Barnes","Yes, yes.","Bob Ramsey","Okay.","Jack Barnes","700 -- actually $700,000.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And then, I guess, if I back out the merger charges, I get earnings of about $0.25 this quarter, that annualizes to about a $1. Is there any reason to think that next year earnings wouldn\u2019t be at least at that level, excluding the merger charges next year as well?","Jack Barnes","They were not compared to get any guidance for next year and this morning.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. For modeling purposes, is it fair to put Suffolk sort of at the very start of next year. Would you think it might be closer to the end of the quarter as the first quarter.","Jack Barnes","I know you that in our hands at all in very difficult to call. So given the assets, I think that\u2019s a position yourself. It's purely in the regulators hands and we\u2019ve no idea when will get any final answers.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess on the preferred issuance you guys have been talking about this for some time. Any sense of timing on when that will actually take place?","Jack Barnes","Well, as we said and what we\u2019ve been saying consistently for at least a year and a half to a is the size and in the back half of 2016, but on the calendar continues to move forward, but we can only be as specific as before the year is over.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. All right. That\u2019s a narrow enough window. That\u2019s fair. I guess last question on how about, but obviously had a good quarter for provision expense, something previously you all have been talking about a number more like 10 million to 12 million. Is that still a good way to think about the fourth quarter or do you think where the world sits today, it could come under that?","Jack Barnes","I think that\u2019s still a good place, in terms of looking at it. I think everybody recognizes now and through our history, we\u2019ve had very low nonperforming levels and charge-offs and it gets pretty bumpy at these levels. Every once in a while you\u2019ve and asset that turns back, so I think planning in the range you\u2019re talking about is appropriate.","Bob Ramsey","Great. Thank you very much.","Greg Foster","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Your lifestyle is now open,","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just back to the discussion on loan growth. So Jack, I appreciate your comments about New York, that's very helpful. But if we just think about sort of how the composition of loan growth has evolved so far this year, CRE balances are down from the beginning of the year, consumer balances are down, but resi mortgage balances are up quite a bit. Can you just, is that strategic in nature, is that more just where the market is kind of taking the portfolio. Can you just kind of give a little bit more color as to what might be driving sort of the shift in some of those loan balances?","Jack Barnes","Sure. So, I will go to where you started first with the CRE, I think and there is a dynamic taking place right now that involves the pullback from the New York Multifamily portfolio, that\u2019s running off. And we are still gauging the pace of that probably somewhere between $20 million and $40 million a quarter. But we'll see how that goes, it slowed as of late. On the other hand, we have a --obviously a wired customer base across the rest of the footprint and now a very strengthened group in New York and we are getting, I would say, good origination, I expect we will up start seeing some growth and CRE as we go forward. And the only contrary, I guess, or signal I'd give there the market does seem to be a little slower, a little softer in terms of transactions this year. So that\u2019s CRE. And C&I is very steady across the middle market, starting to see actually a little better progress on business banking. ABL is having a very strong year. Mortgage warehouse is having a very strong year, even though had a flat quarter, if you will, or modest quarter.","And in equipment finance is also doing reasonably well, although slower overall. Than it has been in the past. And so on the residential and consumer side, the residential side there is a shift [ph], as the shift going on, the mix of purchase and refi is kind of 50-50 lately and the volumes strong, the pipelines are strong. The branches tend to a little less refi -- sorry, little less purchase, so the refi as it slowdown I think is affecting that. We are getting a lot more activity through the mortgage originators, the mortgage account officers and we\u2019re adding as we told you in the past, mortgage account officers, particularly inside 495 in Boston and in New York. So those are the numbers of mortgage originators are up, fairly considerably. And then our wholesale business is seeing a good amount of activity as well. So, it\u2019s a mix of kind of the channels, if you will, in the residential area. And the consumer I think consumer has been flat and continues to be on the flattish side and it tends to build [ph] as we build households and it tends to pull back when refi is more active and people tend to roll their home equities outstanding into fixed rate longer terms. I just want to correct, I said $20 million to $40 million a quarter, and it\u2019s monthly.","David Rosato","The $20 million to $40 million of multifamily write-off is per month.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s good. Thank you. Thank you, Jack. And then, David on the margin, so two basis points benefit this quarter, because of the calendar. I mean, do -- is it sort of fair to assume that if we back that out, then maybe what the trend we see kind of moving into the fourth quarter, lower securities yields, perhaps, and you got the pick up as you mentioned from LIBOR that we could see some NIM compression coming in the fourth quarter or do you think we\u2019ve kind of had a low point and maybe we stabilize here.","David Rosato","If you notice, you\u2019ve seen the craze of NIM compression slowed dramatically. And then, this quarter actually went up a basis point. It's too early to call a bottom in there now. There still is a small and shrinking differential between the existing loan portfolio and you guys have -- and you\u2019re correct. You saw that an 8 basis point decline quarter-over-quarter and security portfolio yield. So, the way I would answer the question is, why are we buying guidance on the margin with 275 to 285 in July and it looks like we are on track to the right there in the middle of that guidance.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","Plus or minus.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just the other income line for you guys is just really good building quite a bit. What\u2019s in that line and is there anything in particular that\u2019s causing that build?","Jack Barnes","Well, we -- I did call out that $2 million increase is driven by a applied private investment partners. So there is a little bit of that in that line, that was -- little over a #3 million in the quarter. There is a lot of little things that go through there, credit card, fees is probably the one of the larger drivers that\u2019s been growing, we talked about that before where, a few quarters ago we entered an agreement with the long and we\u2019re getting a lot of traction in our customer base that\u2019s often that are credit card offering that we now had, that was almost non-existent over the last couple of years. That\u2019s the primary driver, but the rest of the stuff are fees around some retail, home equity feedlots, accounts, things like -- things of that nature.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just one final question on Gerstein Fisher merger that\u2019s coming in early next month. Should we be -- is that going to have a material impact on the model at all, as we think about the influence on fees and expenses, if that comes in?","Jack Barnes","Well, what we said when we announced that deal in Q&A is from a -- [indiscernible] annual run rate of revenue is about $17 million. We also said that it was modestly accretive to 2017.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Jack Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Travis Potts","Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Travis Potts on for Casey. I just had one follow-up question on loan yields. You had a nice spike in C&I. If I assume like most of that $1 million LIBOR impact was in that C&I and accounts for I think about half of that increase, can you just talk to what else is kind of driving those loan yields higher, so any kind of lumpy fees this quarter or anything?","Jack Barnes","Well, its spreads. It\u2019s a combination of LIBOR which we called out and then spreads. That entire portfolio is not one month LIBOR base. We got a little better spread performance during the quarter.","Travis Potts","All right. Thank you, guys.","Jack Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew Breese","Good evening guys.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Breese","Just on the Suffolk Bancorp deal, just curious what are some of the challenges you\u2019re facing getting that deal closed on time and is it normal regulatory delays or does it have anything to do with incrementally putting the balance sheet closer to $50 billion?","Jack Barnes","I don\u2019t believe it has anything to do with that. It really is the normal process that you probably are aware the process is an extended on a post crisis and I think it's generally getting slightly better treat more as of late, but what we see is transactions taking six to nine months and we're in that timeframe. We are certainly hopeful to be on the shorter end, but we as I said, it's nothing in our control. So now to get to the nature of your question, I don't think you should view it as taking longer than the normal.","Matthew Breese","Okay, understood. And then going back to your comment around maintaining the dividend as you cross 50, could we talk about and provide a little more color around that? I mean, is that to imply that you will cross with the dividend or potentially consider other strategic alternatives like a sale of the bank if you can't keep it?","Jack Barnes","No, I wouldn\u2019t over complicate that. We have gotten regulatory support to maintain our dividends and our approach to dividends over an extended period of time, our dividend payout ratio continues to improve, if you will, to get lower over time. And as we move through -- go forward the next few years, we expect to continue to improve profitability, to improve that ratio, and we also expect that the regulatory view of levels of dividend payout ratio for all banks our size and banks in that 50 will evolve and it has been evolving. So trying to be clear that we believe that we will continue to reduce that payout ratio and we believe that we in our dialogue with regulators that we will get support. We obviously can't predict exactly where the payout ratio will be or exactly what the regulatory view will be, but we\u2019ve got very good communication and relationships with our regulators and we will approach those dialogues, I should say we have them regularly and we will continue to have them regularly. That issue will get discussed.","Matthew Breese","Understood. Thank you for that commentary. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hersom for closing remarks.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in People's United. If you\u2019ve any additional questions, please feel free to contact me at 203-338-4581.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks there will be a question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial, Inc., please proceed sir.","Peter Goulding ","Jack Barnes, Kirk Walters, David Rosato, and Jeff Hoyt are here with me to review our first quarter results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide One of this presentation which is posted on our website www.Peoples.com under investor relations. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes ","Good morning everyone. As always we appreciate your joining us today. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the recently announced transition of Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial officer. Kirk is transitioning out of his role as Chief Financial Officer of People\u2019s United Bank for family reasons. David Rosato who has served as treasurer since 2007 will succeed Kirk as Chief Financial Officer of the Bank. As indicated in our press release, Kirk will continue to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the holding company through December 31, 2014 when David is expected to assume that position.","Kirk will remain as an executive officer transitioning to the role of Senior Executive Vice President of Corporate Development and Strategic Planning. He will also remain a member of the Board of Directors of the company and the Bank. For the past year Kirk has successfully managed the intense responsibilities of his role as Chief Financial Officer and director of this company as well as challenging family health issues. ","We are announcing this orderly transition executed according to our corporate succession plan which demonstrates our bench strength. Importantly, Kirk will still report directly to me as a member of the management committee. He will continue to contribute to the company in a role that will leverage his broad experience in the industry and deep operational expertise. We are equally pleased that David, who has contributed significantly to the Bank as treasurer and brings 25 years of experience in banking is well prepared to step into the role of the Bank\u2019s CFO. I feel extremely fortunate to have both of these gentlemen on our management committee.","As part of the transition Michael Ciborowski who has been with People\u2019s United for 20 years and is a long time leader within the treasury group, will become Senior Vice President and Treasurer for both the company and the bank. ","Now, I\u2019d like to share my views on our current strategic positioning. We continue to focus on building this franchise for the long term driving revenue growth while tightly managing expenses. To accomplish this, our seasoned bankers are leveraging People\u2019s United\u2019s well regarded brand to form new relationships and deepen existing relationships across our geographic footprint. Consistent with this approach we have recently added a veteran wealth management team based in Hartford Connecticut and an experienced commercial banking team in eastern Massachusetts. Both of these teams join us from other regional banks, demonstrating our continued ability to attract and retain top talent. ","This quarter\u2019s results reflect the benefit of investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make in the businesses, products, and services as well as our expanded geographic footprint. Generally speaking, the first quarter tends to be seasonally weaker for many of our businesses and expenses tend to be seasonally higher due to payroll taxes and benefit expenses. We are pleased with our ability to control operating expenses especially given the number of strategic investments that we have made and the increasing costs of regulatory compliance.","Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our first quarter results. On Slide Two, operating earnings were $56.5 million or $0.19 per share while net income was $53.1 million or $0.18 per share. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased to $231.8 million which represents 4% annualized growth during the quarter and 4% growth from the first quarter of 2013. Net interest margin declined by seven basis points to 3.17% compared to 3.24% in the fourth quarter of 2013. We continue to expect our full year margin to be within our guidance range of 3.1% to 3.2% which we provided in January. ","End of period loans grew at a 4% annualized rate in the first quarter. This marks our 14th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and our customers. Further, our commercial pipelines remain strong and runoff in the acquired portfolio has settled in at a slower rate as we projected in January. Organic deposits, which exclude brokered deposits, grew at a 10% annualized rate. Success came across our footprint in both retail and commercial growth. ","We are stepping up our emphasis on deposits consistent with our long held preference for relationship based banking on both sides of our balance sheet. Our organic deposit mix also improved with solid demand deposit growth and a decline in timed deposit balances from the prior period. We also added approximately $550 million of brokered deposits during the quarter which brings our annualized growth rate for the quarter up to 20%. ","The efficiency ratio for the quarter increased to 63.9% from 62.8% in the fourth quarter of 2013 primarily due to marginally lower revenues. It is worth noting that we made two changes that impact our efficiency ratio calculations. The first is related to our operating lease business and the second is related to the new accounting guidance for investments and affordable housing projects. Accordingly, our efficiency ratio has been restated for prior quarters to reflect these changes. As we continue to grow both net interest income and fee income while controlling expenses, we anticipate efficiency ratio progress in the quarters ahead. We remain comfortable with our efficiency ratio guidance provided last quarter. ","Asset quality remains strong with net charge offs of 12 basis points and non-performers at 100 basis points, the lowest levels we\u2019ve experienced in five years. As mentioned before, we firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow a balance sheet. Capital ratios remain solid especially in light of our relatively low risk business model. We believe that we have reached an inflection point following the fourth quarter of 2013 completion of our share repurchase program and anticipate growth in tangible equity in the quarters ahead. ","With that I\u2019ll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters ","Thank you, Jack. On Slide Three, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Fewer calendar days in the first quarter negatively impacted net interest income by $3.4 million. Runoff in the acquired loan portfolio resulted in declines in accretion of $3.1 million. This is more than offset by originated loan growth and higher average securities balances which cause net interest income to increase by $6.7 million and $2.4 million respectively. As we have mentioned before growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign for the quarters ahead. ","On Slide Four, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net interest margin results for the quarter. As we described on the fourth quarter call, fewer calendar days impacted the margin by five basis points which will recover throughout the year as the day count normalizes. New loan volume also negatively impacted the margin by five basis points as new business yields remain lower than the total loan portfolio yield. However, it is worth noting that excluding the acquired loans, new business yields were higher than the non-acquired portfolio yield which is a positive indicator for quarters ahead. Changes in loan mix pressured the margin by a basis point and were offset by lower deposit costs. Lastly, larger average balances and slightly higher yields within the investment portfolio had a three basis point positive impact on the margin. ","Slide Five provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $239 million or 4% annualized. This was achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets and strength in product line up. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $353 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. ","Commercial real estate contributed $75 million of the total originated loan growth while C&I contributed $182 million. Within C&I we saw strength across many categories including traditional C&I, asset based lending, and equipment finance. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. ","Residential mortgages contributed $100 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. The residential mortgage portfolio growth was predominately due to solid originations and a continued slowdown in prepayments. Approximately 90% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The originated home equity portfolio declined $4 million due to a seasonal slowdown in quarterly advances. It is important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail originated with 63% of the first quarter originates in a first lien position which has been consistent over the past three years.","We experienced acquired loan runoff of $114 million this quarter compared to $137 million in the fourth quarter and $155 million in the first quarter 2013. We anticipate runoff in all of our loan portfolios including our acquired loan portfolio to remain at low levels. Slow runoff is expected to contribute to healthy loan growth going forward. ","You can see on Slide Six a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Total deposits increased $1.1 billion supported by annualized organic non-interest bearing and saving deposit growth of 5% and 14% respectively. Retail deposits are seasonally stronger due to tax refund receipts. Similarly, within commercial deposits municipal deposits benefit seasonally from January property tax collections. As you think about commercial deposits net quarter, our municipal business tends to be seasonally lower in the second quarter as their fiscal year end activity negatively impacts loan and deposit balances. The actual business fundamentals within this customer base remains strong, it is merely a timing issue. ","Overall, I\u2019m particularly pleased to see growth in commercial deposits. At the commercial bank we are underweight commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasis deposit gathering. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of the customer relationships. ","As we mentioned earlier, we added approximately $550 million in brokered deposits to our funding base during the quarter of which over 80% were money market deposits. Our ongoing focus remains in growing organic deposits and improving the mix of our deposit base. Efforts throughout our franchise to lower deposit costs, particularly in acquired markets, contributed to a further decline in deposit costs of 34 basis points. Acquired deposits represent 12% of total deposits at a weighted average cost of 62 basis points, down 12 basis points or approximately 16% over the last year.","The larger deposit opportunities relate to continued improvement in our deposit mix in favor of non-interest bearing deposits, better utilization of our retail footprint especially in the underrepresented markets of greater Boston and metro New York and emphasizing commercial deposit gathering. These initiatives are expected to support funding, profitability, and customer retention. ","On Slide Seven, we take a closer look at non-interest income which decreased $2.6 million on the linked quarter basis. Income from operating leases and insurance added $1.9 million and $1 million to fee income this quarter. As a reminder, most of our insurance renewals take place in the first and third quarters. Cash management investment management grew $400,000 and $100,000 respectively during the quarter. ","Lower commercial loan originations this quarter led to a $2.4 million decline in customer interest rate swap income. Bank service charges also decreased $1.3 million from the prior quarter due to seasonally lower overdraft and interchange fees. Loan prepayment fees fell $900,000 due to lower payoffs which helped support future loan portfolio growth. Brokerage commissions declined $500,000 primarily due to weather and an increasing shift to investor advisory relationships rather than commission based transactions. Gain on residential mortgage sales also decreased $200,000 due to higher interest rates. ","On Slide Eight, we illustrate the key components of our changes in non-interest expense. As we had mentioned before, we continue to control expenses tightly while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of compliance. Non-operating expenses increased $4.2 million which is mainly attributable to branch closure accruals. We closed four branches during the first quarter as we continually analyze and optimize our branch footprint. ","From an operating expenses perspective professional and outside services declined from the prior quarter by $400,000. Operating lease expenses increased $2.7 million which is partially attributable to a credit loss on a single relationship. As the operating lease business grows, non-interest expense will increase given how this business is accounted for and reported under generally accepted accounting principles. That is, on a gross basis as opposed to a net basis. ","Compensation and benefits increased $2.3 million due primarily to seasonally higher payroll related and benefit related and benefit costs. Occupancy and equipment cost increased $1.5 million as a result of higher building maintenance and snow removal costs. The net impact is a $3.8 million increase in operating expenses for the quarter. ","The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last five quarters. As Jack discussed earlier, our efficiency ratio has been restated in prior periods to one that will reflect the impact of our operating business and two, to reflect the adoption of new account guidance pertaining to investments in affordable housing projects. Under GAAP the income from operating leases is reported as a component of fee income while the related expenses, which are primarily depreciation on leased equipment and credit cost are reported as a component of non-interest expense. The change we made in our efficiency ratio calculations are designed to make operating lease income closely resemble net interest income from a loan. ","The second item that impacted our efficiency ratio calculation relates to low income housing tax credits. In late 2013 the FASB amended its standards with respect to the accounting for investments in qualified affordable housing projects to allow an investor that meets certain conditions, to amortize the cost of its investment in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits it receives and present the amortization as a component of income tax expense. People\u2019s United elected early to adopt this amendment on January 1, 2014. ","The change did not have a significant impact on the company\u2019s consolidated financial statement as the amortization previously included non-interest income is now a component of income tax expense. This results in higher fee income and a higher effective tax rate. The effective tax rate for the first quarter is 34.3% which represents an increase of 280 basis points over our previously reported full year 2013 effective tax rate of 31.5%. The increase is primarily due to our adoption of this new accounting treatment for affordable housing investments. Accordingly, our earlier expectation regarding our 2014 effective tax rate of 32.5% has also been revised. We now estimate that our 2014 effective tax rate will be approximately 35%. ","Over the past two quarters our efficiency ratio has been impacted by lower non-interest income, higher compliance costs, investments in revenue producing initiatives, all of which mask the tight expense control. We continue to remain very focused on improving operating leverage. ","Slide 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry leading levels. Originated non-performing assets of 1% of originated loans in REO, remain well below our peer group and top 50 bank and are down approximately 30% from 1.42% in the first quarter 2013. ","Acquired non-performing loans are not included in these calculations due to the different accounting model applicable to such loans. However, it is worth noting that we are very pleased with their performance as we have seen these balances decline $35 million or 19% to $146 million in the current quarter from $181 million a year ago. ","Looking at Slide 11, net charge offs continue to remain low at 12 basis points compared to 18 basis points last quarter and 24 basis points one year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge offs, net charge offs this quarter were nine basis points. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets and are well below peers. Over the last four quarters, charge offs against specific reserves represent approximately 53% of total charge offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","Now, I\u2019ll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes ","Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 21% and 19% respectively. ","Operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 69 basis points compared to 75 basis points in the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra low interest rate environment until recent initiatives which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by loan and deposit growth, fee income growth, and continued disciplined approach to expenses. ","Slide 14 illustrates improvement in our return on average tangible equity since the first quarter of 2013. We expect to see continued progress in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. ","On Slide 15 we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain solid with our tier-1 common at 10.1% and our intangible common equity ratio at 8%. We continue to look for ways to best serve our customers and build relationships while maintaining tight expense control and returning capital to shareholders. Our commitment to outstanding customer service combined with our existing and growing set of capabilities allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent as evidenced again this quarter, all of which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. ","This concludes our presentation. Now, I will be happy to answer questions that you may have. Operator we are ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from David Darst of Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Kirk, could you maybe kind of reconcile some of the period end loan commercial balances versus the average for the quarter and is there any change to your outlook for full year loan growth?","Kirk W. Walters ","If you look at the end of period end-over-end growth it was annualized about 4%. If you look at averages we were up pretty significantly during the quarter and that\u2019s a reflection of the fact that we had a strong fourth quarter and in particularly in the fourth quarter we had a lot of production that came in in the month of December and so that carried through the averages for the first quarter. In terms of our outlook for loan growth, no, we continue to be very comfortable with our outlook for the overall loan growth. The first quarter tends to be seasonally slower for us and we did see some of that slowness and in particular January\/February tend to be a little slower and in March we did see good activity and we overall feel good about our pipelines and where they stand at this point. Jack may want to add a couple of things to that.","John P. Barnes ","I agree, we\u2019re encouraged with the activity, particularly in March kind of came back to the pace that we had been experiencing and we\u2019re very comfortable with the guidance that we gave in January in terms of our expectations for the year. ","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","As we look at the acquired portfolio what do you think is the remaining life? I guess based on the repayments this quarter it looks like it will be about three years. Should we assume that that\u2019s the case and the benefit will just be declining or is there any point where you lose some of that margin benefit?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think in terms of the acquired loans overall, one we did, as we mentioned, experience a little slower payoff in the first quarter which was a little lower if you annualized that than the guidance we gave which was encouraging. In general, what we have left in the acquired loans are bank type of loans and we would say that the [lives] [ph] probably range three to five years, somewhere in that type of range.","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Kirk, is the tax rate change related to the accounting for the affordable housing credits?","Kirk W. Walters ","Yes. In essence what happened is under the old accounting the amortization of those credits flowed through non-interest income as a debit or negative to non-interest income and then you had the benefit coming through in the income tax line and now with the new accounting all of that gets netted down in the tax line. So, I think the way to think about it is that non-interest income will run higher and we\u2019ve restated prior periods so you have consistent numbers, and on the other side we are going to have a higher effective tax rate so it\u2019s really a switch in geography.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","I guess my question is sort of around the balance sheet. Just first, on the funding side, was there a shift there from borrowings to brokered deposits or were those two separate transactions? It just looks like you delevered a bit so I just wanted to get a little bit more understanding of what was happening there?","Kirk W. Walters ","As we had indicated in January, we are taking on some brokered deposits as one more lever in overall funding. As those have come on in the pace they came on at, we did use some of those to pay down some borrowings during the quarter and obviously the pace that we take on both of those will be driven a bit by the pace on the loan growth side as well. In terms of deleveraging, in the securities portfolio this quarter there has been opportunities when rates have dipped. We have exited a few of our lower coupon CMOs. ","On the other side we are carrying a higher average balance this quarter because as we did build that securities portfolio in the fourth quarter we didn\u2019t necessarily have it on for the entire quarter. So, a little bit like loans, our averages are higher but the difference is end-over-end a little bit lower.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Sort of the structure of the brokered deposits and the borrowings you swapped, is it the same? You mentioned brokered deposits was money market, is that right?","Kirk W. Walters ","That\u2019s the bulk of them but I\u2019ll let David go ahead and answer that question as well.","David Rosato ","Yes, the home loan advances is a very short book so think of that as one to three month liabilities and it\u2019s almost been a one-to-one substitution as Kirk said, for brokered deposits which are money markets primarily with a small component of three month to two year CDs. ","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","You mentioned Kirk the muni deposit flows that we need to be thinking about in the second quarter, how big is your muni deposit base? ","Kirk W. Walters ","Well, the deposit flows that we tend to reference in the second quarter in terms of the volatility that we see there, it\u2019s probably between maybe $60 million and $90 million. It\u2019s largely an anomaly with the great state of Vermont where the end of the fiscal year, June 30, they have to pay off their debt so they take money out of deposits and they pay off loans and by the middle of July it tends to come back in. So that\u2019s generally the range.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Then just one last question, I know you had commented that you feel comfortable with the total loan growth outlook that you guys had stated early in the year. How do you think about the mix though? I guess I was somewhat surprised to see the component of resi mortgage growth in the first quarter. Is the mix expectation still going to be the same and this is just an anomaly in the first quarter or how should we think about the components of that growth?","John P. Barnes ","I think that what we saw in the first quarter though more modest than the last December quarters, we saw the mix across the board and so we were pleased with the residential growth and the pace there and it was probably a little bit more than we expected but in the commercial book it was pretty much across the board. I think as Kirk said in his comments, different business lines, different loan types, all moving forward and that\u2019s the way we see it happening throughout the year. We had some nice growth in ABL this quarter. That business has a nice pipeline and we seem to be making nice progress there. ","The New York commercial real estate was a little slower in the first quarter but the pipeline is back and March was strong. Connecticut has been good. The equipment finance businesses has been very good over the last number of quarters and again, a good solid quarter this time and good pipeline. So, pretty much across the board and continuing to move forward. We also have the new group that we hired in Boston and our new Massachusetts president Pat Sullivan has done a nice job with the existing team. They\u2019ve got a lot of momentum of building pipeline and adding the new team will give all of them additional momentum as they move forward. We\u2019re looking forward to that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","I wanted to ask a little bit about efficiency. I know you guys detailed pretty well the changes in the calculation methodology and also said you remain confident with your prior efficiency targets. I think previously you said that by year end you hope to have efficiency in the low 60s. Given that the new methodology sort of helps your efficiency ratio by a couple of hundred basis points, I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re still comfortable with that low 60s number if you didn\u2019t adjust for the leasing income and expense or whether that\u2019s a part of how you stay in that range?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think overall we remain very comfortable with the guidance of being in the low 60s on the efficiency ratio and as we detailed in January, the primary driver of getting that lower efficiency ratio is really going to come through growth in net interest income and so I think our overall comfort level with the pipelines, loan growth, what\u2019s happened on the deposit side which was encouraging, and seasonally first quarter is always tough in terms of expenses particularly payroll taxes, 401k match, and unfortunately we had a lot of snow this year. As we look forward to the balance of the year we do believe all the trends are such that we will end up in the low 60s there.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","I guess maybe asking my question another way, when you all gave guidance for that level to be in the low 60s, it was under the old efficiency calculation given that the new calculation is beneficial by a couple hundred basis points is it possible to get into the high 50s now that you\u2019re using the new methodology? ","Kirk W. Walters ","It is possible to get into that and when you think about the new methodology, this was something that we had detailed in our K and we had also detailed a couple of other places about it, but yes it is possible.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","We\u2019ve talked about efficiency improvement for a long time and obviously efficiency in the last several quarters has kind of been moving against you given the revenue headwinds. What gives you greater confidence as you look forward today that sort of efficiency is going to turn direction?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think the biggest thing is what we\u2019ve detailed over the last few quarters is we believe 90% of the efficiency gains we\u2019re going to have going forward is on the revenue side. We are at this point running a larger balance sheet. We gave a lot of information, particularly in year end, about the headwinds we had last year in terms of accretion run off and certainly those are less this year. If you simply look at the first quarter slide on net interest income and you take out the day count change, you see that the growth in net interest income from originated loans is clearly outpacing the accretion run off and such. ","Those are some of the turns that we\u2019ve been looking for and expecting to have. So, it really is going to be topline growth but I think we\u2019ve invested a lot in terms of getting to this point. At the same point, we\u2019ve very tightly controlled expenses to allow us to invest that money and we are feeling very good about the outlook in terms of the guidance we\u2019ve given for the year.","Bob Ramsey \u2013 FBR Capital Markets","The last question, and you may have said this earlier, it\u2019s possible I missed it, but are you guys still targeting full year expenses in the range of $830 million to $840 million?","Kirk W. Walters ","Absolutely.","John P. Barnes ","That is correct.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays.","Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays","Can you just give us those numbers again on how much seasonal compensation and benefit expenses and the snow removal, what were those in the quarter again?","Kirk W. Walters ","Well, what we advertised in the January in the first quarter is typically the higher payroll taxes, 401k match in the first quarter run in the range of $5 million to $6 million. The additional sort of winter costs, if you want to think about winter costs snow removal and different things, probably ran in the number right around $1 million. ","Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays","Then on the commercial loan growth that you outline in the [inaudible] here, the $257 million, how much of that was in the New York City multiple family commercial real estate market and what were the pricing trends like in the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters ","When we look at the first quarter in terms of the multi business, it was pretty flat in terms of the New York side. Up a little bit but overall pretty flat. My experience in that market there has been that the first quarter there\u2019s always a big rush towards year end to book in a lot of stuff and January\/February can be fairly slow and then you see better activity in March. I\u2019d say on the pricing side we overall saw spreads in that business, which is where we tend to think about it, as maybe up just a few ticks from where we saw in the fourth quarter. But like I say, it\u2019s generally my observation has been it\u2019s a little bit of a slower quarter in terms of activity.","Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays","Then going to the balance sheet, are we going to see additional declines in securities portfolios or additional sales of CMOs and repositioning or are we going to be stabilized around the $4.7 billion portfolio?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think you can assume that we\u2019ll be generally stabilized around that. We could see a little more run off as we go into the end of the year and some of that is driven by the regulatory side in terms of what we are doing with QTL. ","Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays","Can you just talk a little bit more as it pertains on both securities and on the loan to deposit mix and overall liquidity profile, loan to deposit ratio came down but talk about what other actions you might take throughout the course of the year on the liquidity or loan or deposit front?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think one, we did see the loan to deposit ratio come down and we were actually pretty encouraged with the organic deposit growth we saw come through and particularly on the commercial side. We are very focused internally on all the different, both retail and commercial, and continuing to get good solid deposit growth and bringing that along as we\u2019ve experienced the solid lending growth we\u2019ve had in a lot of our new initiatives. In terms of our liquidity itself and changes surrounding that sort of mix between brokered borrowings, etc., I\u2019ll have David go ahead and answer that.","David Rosato ","I would characterize going forward a general continuation of what we\u2019ve seen. Deposits tend to be seasonally stronger in the first quarter with both commercial and retail deposit growth. Our expectation would be for that to continue. We\u2019re going to continue to layer in brokered deposits and you will continue to see home loan advances come down. So from a liquidity perspective continuation of building of liquidity, building of organic as well as brokered deposits. The net effect on the loan to deposit ratio should be positive. We probably had a little more progress this quarter just because loan growth was a little lighter than expectations. ","Matthew Keating \u2013 Barclays","Then where do you see the loan to deposit ratio ending for the year?","David Rosato ","In the neighborhood of where it is today to slightly lower.","","John P. Barnes ","We do have a lot of initiatives underway. We\u2019ve talked about some of them in the past, but I do think we\u2019re very encouraged on the commercial side about the focus on cross selling and strongly including deposit gathering and the relationship managers are doing a great job there. Every time we talk about a relationship and a credit need we\u2019re talking about where the deposits are and people are making great progress. We\u2019ve strengthened the incentive programs around that and we also had some additional progress in New York in the old Citizens\u2019 branches. We\u2019ve talked about hitting our target a year ahead of time. We continue to build the averages there nicely and the managers in the New York market are doing a great job of continued progress. It\u2019s all been encouraging.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies.","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Can you touch a little bit on the fee guidance? I think you guys were calling for fees to be flat with last year\u2019s number and we\u2019re off to a little bit of a weak start here. Are you guys still comfortable with that guidance and if so what do you see as kind of accelerating from here?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think we remain very comfortable with the guidance. First quarter is seasonally a lighter quarter for us. We see it in a lot of areas, particularly bank service charges, derivative income, a variety of things. Overall, we remain encouraged regarding the different businesses wealth management in particular but the other businesses cash management, etc. are progressing as expected. The other part is one of the things that even though we\u2019ve given guidance that it was going to be done roughly half year-over-year in terms of mortgage marketing gains, we did experience that being a little lighter in the first quarter but as we look at pipelines and such we\u2019ve seen a nice build in pipelines on that side in late March into April.","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Just to be clear, the cash management and derivatives, does that show up in other?","Kirk W. Walters ","Cash management rolls up in bank services charges. The derivative rolls up in other.","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Then apologies if I missed this, but just on the new money yields for loan production, I think it was a five bip drag on the NIM this quarter, it sounded though Kirk as if you were being pretty constructive in where the new money yields are coming on. Should we expect that five bip drag to sort of decrease as the year goes on?","Kirk W. Walters ","I think the drag will continue to decrease a bit. The difference is the comments I made was when we looked at the new money yield coming on as compared to the originated portfolios, we were encouraged to see that the rates that we\u2019re coming on at were at or actually above where the originated portfolio yields are. As you know, with the details we give on the acquired loans, that impacts a margin to the tune of about nine basis points so when you do throw that in there, net\/net new money is coming in at a lower rate but we try to look at it pound-for-pound against the originated so I think that was an encouraging note.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jason O\u2019Donnell \u2013 Merion Capital Group.","Jason O\u2019Donnell \u2013 Merion Capital Group","Most of my questions have been answered but I do have one remaining one. With respect to the branch consolidation activities that you\u2019re engaged in, I believe you cited four closures in the first quarter. Do you have an estimate at this point of how many additional branch closings or consolidations we could see later this year and if so, if you could frame out maybe the opportunity here on the cost front that would be helpful?","John P. Barnes ","We do have several additional closings planned and in terms of kind of framing out exactly the impact, I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head. I don\u2019t think any of us do around the table. But, we continue to work that equation hard. We\u2019ve obviously, if you look back over the last several years we\u2019ve been pretty active there and continue to rationalize it and watching traffic, consumer behavior, use of all the channels, etc. We generate a lot of assets off of our branch platform as well so we look at the whole picture and we\u2019ll again, as we go forward, continue to be very aggressive at managing that. ","Kirk W. Walters ","As we go through the year, as Jack mentioned, we will have some additional closings. The other side of the equation is that through the Stop N\u2019 Shop contract we will be opening some additional branches at Stop N\u2019 Shop and like this quarter, typically what we\u2019re closing is traditional branches which are a lot more expensive than our Stop N\u2019 Shop branches in terms of opening it up. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Sandler O\u2019Neill and Partners.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually Matt filling in or Mark. A quick question from you on the core contractual margin. We saw a little bit of compression there this quarter and just assuming the yield curve holds its current shape, do you think we can continue to see this bleed down and maybe crossover into the high twos? Can you give us a sense of how you\u2019re looking at that?","Kirk W. Walters ","Well, we gave guidance in January we expect the margin to be between a 310 and 320 for the year. If you look at this quarter 317 and you adjust for the day count, which of course comes back throughout the year, gets you back at around 322 and so we feel really pretty good about the margin guidance that we\u2019ve given and that we will be operating within that guidance this year. ","Unidentified Analyst","Then just on the macro level, can you give us a sense where the competition is strongest in the footprint and where perhaps you have some opportunities to garner some share?","John P. Barnes ","I would say the competition is strong across the footprint in all the lines of business as it has been historically. There are perhaps kind of growing, although again I don\u2019t think relatively new this quarter or last three quarters, growing competition in places like ABL for instance. There\u2019s been a lot of new entrants into the ABL business in the last few years. But as I think across the different business lines, the competition is strong across the footprint and across the different business lines.","I would say we get back to how we\u2019re positioned, and our size, and our capabilities and we continue to make progress on being a large enough bank to meet the needs of more of our customers across the footprint in middle market and mid corporate levels and we have a relationship based approach and a value proposition that really is very responsive to our customers and very close to them and we can be there. I can meet with customers, senior management of the bank can meet with customers. We\u2019re accessible, we make ourselves available and that differentiates from the very largest players that just don\u2019t have that capability. ","Operator","","The final question comes from Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Just a quick follow up question, I know you guys had mentioned in the past at perhaps looking at shifting to a bank charter. Can you comment on that, is that something that is still is getting kicked around or how are you thinking about that?","John P. Barnes ","We do continue to kick it around and we\u2019re basically in the same mode if you will that we have been since we withdrew our application, it seems like some time ago now. But the landscape in our view keeps changing and we continue to evaluate the kind of relative strength and weaknesses of the alternatives and haven\u2019t settled at this point. It is certainly not impacting our business in any way.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen this will conclude the time we have for questions. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.","Peter Goulding ","Thank you again for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in People\u2019s United.

[Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our second quarter 2018 results are Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, President; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","John Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let\u2019s begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. Our commitment to enhancing profitability was further demonstrated by reporting record quarterly net income of $110.2 million or $0.31 per common share. These results reflect the continued benefits of investments in revenue producing initiatives, sustained excellent asset quality and recent successful acquisitions. On an operating basis, earnings were $0.32 per common share, up $0.08 or 33% from a year-ago and operating return on average tangible common equity was 14.2%, an increase of 330 basis points over the same period.","Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4%, an improvement of 100 basis points on a linked-quarter basis. Total revenues of $396 million increased 3% as a result of growth in both net interest income driven by net interest margin expansion and non-interest income. The margin improved 5 basis points and benefited from an increase in loan yields that continue to outpace the rise in deposit costs.","Operating expenses of $246 million, which includes $4 million in costs related to branch closures, increased only $2 million or 1%. Average loan balances were flat compared to the first quarter, while period-end balances were up $408 million or 1%, reflecting stronger activity in June compared to the first two months of the quarter. Growth was driven by solid results in middle-market C&I, equipment financing, and mortgage warehouse lending.","Year-to-date overall loan growth has been flat and below our expectations. These results are primarily attributed to continued headwinds in commercial real estate, which have caused balances in this portfolio to decline over $300 million or 6% annualized during the first half of 2018.","As we have discussed previously, commercial real estate has been impacted by runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio, which has totaled $228 million year-to-date, heightened competition and above average payoffs. Since commercial real estate is our largest portfolio, these headwinds have reduced the rate of growth of the overall portfolio.","Additionally, year-to-date loan growth has also been impacted by a decline of over $100 million in home equity balances or 10% annualized, which is consistent with overall industry results. The reduction in home equity balances was driven by lower originations and lower initial utilization rates.","However, exclusive of commercial real estate and home equity, we are experiencing strong results across many of our businesses that are in line with our expectations for the year. For example, middle-market C&I has achieved a 5% annualized growth this year, while equipment financing is up 10% annualized.","Looking forward, the strength of our diversified business mix, the solid period-end pipeline and continued benefits from revenue producing initiatives caused us to be optimistic that loan growth in the second half of the year will be meaningfully better than the first six months.","Moving on to deposits. Balances were lower as a result of seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. However, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters in line with historical seasonal trends. We did see a pick up in industry deposit cost during the second quarter. However, in our view the industry continues to behave rationally. While we will remain competitive, gathering deposits in order to protect share and client relationships, we will continue to be disciplined and not lead the market in pricing.","Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of Vend Lease, a Baltimore-based equipment finance company established in 1979 that operates primarily in the hospitality industry. Vend Lease shares our client-centric approach, has a highly specialized skill set and is a recognized brand in the markets it serves. The Company will become a division of LEAF Commercial Capital, enabling it to leverage LEAF\u2019s technology platform, marketing team, and leading automation capabilities creating greater efficiencies across sales and operational functions.","Additionally, Vend Lease will also be able to leverage the size and strength of our balance sheet and lower funding cost to further accelerate growth and enhance profitability. We are excited about the transaction as the strength of our combined expertise will provide an exceptional experience for clients even our network of specialty finance experts and bolsters our nationwide businesses.","Additionally, in June, we announced an agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp, the holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction continues the momentum generated from our recent acquisitions of Suffolk and LEAF as well as provides us with a classic in market acquisition of a high quality franchise that further strengthens our well established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts.","The integration process is underway and progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach. As a result of the integration activities, we are even more excited about the transaction, particularly the talented people that will be joining us. This transaction has low execution risks, given our significant knowledge to Farmington Bank and the history of successful integrations. We are confident that transaction will close in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory approvals.","Finally, as many of you know Jeff Tengel was promoted to President during the second quarter and is leading the full complement of business lines at People's United. Jeff joined the Company in 2010 from PNC Bank to lead the commercial division. Since that time, he has significantly expanded the commercial division and its product offerings with the addition of mortgage warehouse, large corporate banking, international services, health care, and syndications.","He has broadened and grown treasury management, government banking, asset-based lending and the equipment finance businesses. He is also played an important role in integrating the numerous acquisitions completed over the last eight years. As we continue to grow as a Company, we need to make sure our organizational structure supports the future trajectory of People\u2019s United. Jeff is uniquely qualified to help lead us through our future expansion.","With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the second quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3, net interest income of $301.2 million increased $5.4 million or 2% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $12.6 million of the increase, the net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the continued upward repricing of floating-rate loans.","Net interest income also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1.1 million from prior yields in the securities portfolio. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.4 million reduction in net interest income due to higher deposit cost. In addition, net interest income was unfavorably impacted by $4.8 million resulting from an increase in borrowing costs.","Net interest margin of 3.10% was 5 basis points higher than the first quarter. As displayed on Slide 4, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 13 basis points, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield for the sixth consecutive quarter.","Net interest margin also benefited 2 basis points from the additional calendar day, while higher yields in the securities portfolio added the basis point. Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing cost lower the margin by 6 basis points and 5 basis points respectively.","Looking at loans on Slide 5, average balances of $32.1 billion were flat compared to the first quarter, while period end balances of $32.5 billion were up $408 million or 1%. The growth was driven by solid results in middle market C&I, equipment financing, and mortgage warehouse lending.","The increase in equipment financing balances was driven by each of our equipment financing units with particularly strong results coming from LEAF. In addition, the acquisition of Vend Lease which closed at the end of June, added $68 million to the LEAF\u2019s portfolio. The mortgage warehouse lending portfolio rebound in the second quarter and balances ended the period at $1.1 billion up $95 million from the end of the first quarter.","Commercial real estate balances declined on both an average and period end basis as the portfolio continued to be impacted by the factors Jack outlined earlier. However, excluding the runoff in the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio of $79 million, commercial real estate balances grew modestly from the end of the first quarter.","We now expect the runoff in our transactional New York multifamily portfolio to be $350 million to $400 million for the full-year and increased from our expectation in January of $250 million to $300 million. Average deposit balances for the second quarter were $32.5 billion, down $288 million or 1% linked quarter, while period-end deposits were also $32.5 billion, down $426 million or 1%.","The lower balances resulted from seasonal declines in our municipal and retail businesses. On a period-end basis, municipal and retail balances declined approximately $500 million and $100 million respectively for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect deposits to rebound in the third and fourth quarters in line with historical seasonal trends.","Turning to Slide 6, which displays average deposits by product, you can see the $288 million reductions was driven by a $268 million decline in interest-bearing checking and money market balances and $154 million decline in savings balances. The declines were partially offset by growth in non-interest-bearing checking balances of $76 million and time balances of $58 million.","While deposit costs were up 8 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing, as demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit beta of 20% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 33% during the same period. Specifically for the second quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 40%, while the loan yield beta was 76%.","Looking at Slide 7, non-interest income of $94.9 million increased $4.5 million or 5% on a linked quarter basis. The increase in non-interest income was driven primarily by higher customer interest rate swap income of $2.5 million as well as increases in bank service charges and cash management fees.","The largest offsets to these improvements were a $1.5 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are lower in the second and fourth quarters of the year and $1 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees due to the lower loan prepayment fees. Included in other non-interest income this quarter was $2 million of gains related to certain legacy investments.","On Slide 8, non-interest expense of $248.6 million, increased $5.1 million or 2% from the first quarter. Included in the second quarter results were merger-related expenses of $2.9 million. $2.1 million of the merger-related expenses are in professional and outside services, while the remainder is in other non-interest expense.","Excluding merger-related expenses, non-interest expenses increased $2.2 million or 1% from the first quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $4.1 million in costs related to ten branch closures spread throughout the franchise as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel.","In addition, advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.6 million. Both branch closure and advertising and promotion costs are located in the other expense line in our earnings release. The largest offset to these increases was a $5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefits driven by lower payroll related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter.","We continue to enhance operating leverage has evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio. Higher revenues and well-controlled expenses generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4% and improvement of 100 basis points on a linked quarter basis as shown on Slide 9.","On a year-over-year basis, the efficiency ratio was flat. However, as a reminder beginning last quarter, the efficiency ratio includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in a lower FTE adjustment to net interest income.","As demonstrated on Slide 10, asset quality continues to be exception. As a result of our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards, originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 62 basis points was up 4 basis points linked quarter, but improved 5 basis points from an already low level in the prior year quarter.","The modest increase from the end of the first quarter was driven by two unrelated C&I credits. This metric continues to be well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points was unchanged on the most recent quarter and continues to reflect the minimal loss contest of our non-performing assets.","Moving on to Slide 11, we remain pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return on average assets of 1% and return on average tangible common equity of 13.9% each improved compared to the prior year quarter and first quarter.","On an operating basis, return on average assets of 99 basis points increased 22 basis points from a year-ago and return on average tangible common equity of 14.2% was up 330 basis points over the same period. As we continue to build the earnings power of the Company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.","Continuing on to Slide 12, capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","Continuing the Slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates and we continue to be well-positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based up from 43% at the end of the first quarter and a year-ago.","Before opening the call up for questions, I want to draw your attention to Slide 14. As we have provided an update for our full-year 2018 goals. It\u2019s important to note these goals did not include First Connecticut, but do incorporate the acquisition and Vend Lease.","Our updated goals are as follows. Acknowledging the impact on first half 2018 loan growth from commercial real estate headwinds and the industry wide slowdown in home equity market, we expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 3% to 5%, a modest reduction to our original goal. Deposit growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%. Total expenses excluding merger related costs are now in the range of $975 million to $985 million.","Finally, we have also lowered our provision to a range of $25 million to $35 million. It is important to note that full-year goals or net interest income, net interest margin, non-interest income, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged. In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact to our original full-year earnings expectations.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Hopefully an easy one to start off. Just in terms of the full-year 2018 goals, I guess what's the missing piece here? Because if your loan balances are less than what you thought deposits to less, your margin is unchanged though. Why would net interest income also be unchanged? Presumably are you expecting to make stronger securities growth? Or something doesn't seem to be \u2013 or something seems to be missing with that calculation?","David Rosato","Hi, Ken. It\u2019s David. I would just say, the margin is wide enough in the guidance that a slight reduction and I emphasis that were slight lowered loan and deposit goals by 1%, as well as a slightly different mix of the loan portfolio will provide the offset.","Kenneth Zerbe","Gotcha. Okay. I understood. I guess with commercial real estate, if CRE and I've heard a lot from other banks talk about the CRE conditions are challenging an aggressive pricing. But if CRE does get worse from here, are you still able to hit your loan growth guidance like how bad of a \u2013 I mean, I know where your runoff, is that 350, 400, but could that runoff be even worse, where it does further pressure your loan growth guidance?","John Barnes","Yes. Sure, Ken. This is Jack. Yes, naturally in any of the loan categories, but if CRE gets significantly worse that certainly could impact our expectations in that portfolio, the rest of the year.","We had seen a higher pace in payoffs than we expected and a higher runoff in the multi-family portfolio than we expected and that\u2019s \u2013 while we\u2019ve had good activity in originations in the commercial real estate portfolio, we still have active customers. Those will higher rates on the downside have outpaced what we had expected for kind of remain end of period and average balances.","Kenneth Zerbe","Gotcha. Okay. And then just maybe the last quick question. In terms of Vend Lease, can you quantify the amount of earnings accretion or the size of the portfolio, just to be have a sense of the magnitude? Thanks.","David Rosato","Sure. I'll just tell you, it's $68 million at close. At the end of the quarter, it was about a $68 million worth of outstandings. So relatively small, [indiscernible] will be accretive to lease yields.","Kenneth Zerbe","Gotcha. Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you very much.","John Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So I guess, I wanted to follow-up on the loan growth. So the loan growth guide does factor into Vend, correct?","David Rosato","Correct.","John Barnes","Yes.","Casey Haire","And that's only $68 million?","David Rosato","Correct.","Casey Haire","So doesn\u2019t that still presume a pretty healthy ramp in the back half of 2018 to hit the low end of that guide? I mean what kind of \u2013 I'm sorry, I'm just doing the math real quick, but it seems like you're going to need some pretty strong loan growth in the back half with some headwinds in multi-family that you called out as well as I'm assuming mortgage warehouse might be seasonally weak? So is there something you can do to help us out like on the loan pipelines and what sort of volumes you're expecting?","John Barnes","Sure, Casey. It does imply strong growth in the back half of the year, but our [pipelines] \u2013 so we had a very strong June. Our pipelines are strong. They\u2019re actually up a bit from June 30, relative to March 31, so \u2013 and we saw good strength in \u2013 as we called out in a traditional middle-market in mortgage warehouse and across all of our equipment financing businesses.","So we feel that lowering our guidance by 1% is appropriate at this point. But even in commercial real estate, our customers are still doing business, it's just been a little bit slower than we expected when we originally gave guidance, and the multifamily has come off a little bit more than we expected as well.","John Barnes","Hey, Casey, this is Jack. Let me ask Jeff Tengel to give us some color on kind of discussions around pipeline and activity in the various markets, so maybe give you some idea where our comfort in our forecast comes from.","Jeffrey Tengel","Yes. Hi, Casey. It\u2019s Jeff. We have added as David mentioned accelerating growth in the second quarter in a number of our core businesses, middle market C&I being one of them in particular in our legacy Connecticut markets and in our Boston market which are two of our largest businesses.","We've also had really good momentum in growth in some of our specialty businesses. Healthcare being one of them, asset-based lending being another. They both have very robust pipeline, so we expect a very strong second half with \u2013 in both of those businesses.","Our equipment finance businesses have all been showing good growth and they're typically stronger in the second half of the year than they are in the first anyway. So they're coming into the second half with some momentum that we find encouraging. And finally, the commercial real estate business, well they do have good pipeline as Jack and David both referenced it is \u2013 the market is challenging.","And I think as we've talked in the past, a lot of our customers are what I would consider middle market, real estate customers are investing their own money, so they tend to be a little bit more conservative. They're not funds, investing other people's money, and so on balance they are less active than maybe some of the recent funds in the market. But we are still supporting them, we're still very active with our customers and expect to continue to be active in the second half of the year and we're just going to have to battle the headwinds that David [alluded].","Casey Haire","Okay. Fair enough. And then a question on the loan yields. The loans yields are actually were up quite nicely. Was that all asset sensitivity? Or was there any discount accretion in there?","John Barnes","There's very little discount accretion in there. Our deals are quite seasoned at this point. We had spread held up well in the quarter as we referenced at the end of the quarter, 44% of that book is prime in one-month LIBOR, so that\u2019s where you see the asset sensitivity and we also called out that this has been the sixth consecutive quarter where the new business flow has been accretive to the existing portfolio yield. We also picked up, if you go back and look at the timing of the Fed rate hikes. We basically picked up the whole quarter after the last month.","Casey Haire","Gotcha. Okay. And just last one for me. I just want to make sure I have the expenses right, so the GAAP expenses of just under 249 and then it appears to be about $7 million in specials between the merger charges and the branch closures. So is the starting point for 3Q like 242 or so, assuming there's no recurring specialty.","David Rosato","Yes. That\u2019s basically \u2013 you're right. We had the 41 branch closures that we \u2013 the 29 to deal our expenses. So it gave us confidence to lower the top end of that guidance by $10 million.","Casey Haire","Gotcha. Thank you.","John Barnes","Thank you. You're welcome Casey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jared Shaw","Hi. How are you?","John Barnes","Hi, Jared.","Jared Shaw","Maybe just following up on that expense question, I guess why wouldn't we \u2013 was that $4.1 million is that all severance and lease termination things like that for the branch closures?","David Rosato","Yes. It\u2019s the cost associated with closing ten branches.","Jared Shaw","Okay.","David Rosato","Yes, so the equipment write-offs, there some lease terminations in there. It\u2019s not people.","Jared Shaw","Okay.","David Rosato","Those employees round up in other branches.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then any apart from any branch activity with the Farmington deal? Any anticipated additional branch closures as we go through the end of the year?","David Rosato","Not out of \u2013 no exclusive of what happens with the Farmington integration.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then is \u2013 I\u2019m looking at the linked quarter change in loans and you have $53 million growth of equipment finance, but you said you brought on $68 million from Vend Lease? What was \u2013 and so apart from that I guess we'd see a decline in equipment finance this quarter? Was that repositioning in the portfolio or is that really more just market and customer driven?","David Rosato","Hey, Jared, we just turned you off. We're having trouble hearing you. Can you repeat?","Jared Shaw","Yes, I'm sorry. If I look at the equipment finance line, it looks like you had $53 million of growth on Slide 5 there, but with the $68 million you brought over from Vend Lease? Where was the decline \u2013 where would the net decline have been without that acquisition? Was that more customer driven or is that more you positioning the portfolio?","David Rosato","Go ahead John.","John Barnes","It looks like you're looking at averages Jared and at the end of the areas where the $68 million came in from Vend. We're actually up in the other business as well, particularly lease.","Jared Shaw","Okay.","David Rosato","Vend Lease came in on the last day of the quarter.","Jared Shaw","Okay, got it. Perfect. Thanks. And then finally, you talked about the deposit beta 40% this quarter and 76% on the loan beta. In the past, you've talked about ultimately a deposit beta of around 50%? When do you think you \u2013 we ultimately get there? Is that something that happens you think in 2018 or is it still a little further out as ultimately to the 50% beta?","David Rosato","Yes. It\u2019s a good question and it\u2019s hard to say Jared. It really has a lot to do with how competitive retail deposits wind up being. The commercial deposit betas have moved up and they\u2019re exactly where we would expect them to be at this point in the rate cycle. The retail competition is rational as Jack referenced.","But you're starting to see more banks running especially in the CD market and the CD rates have gotten to the point where you are seeing balances start to migrate out of some non-maturity deposits like savings accounts and now accounts in the CD, so it just going to be the pace of that. I\u2019d be surprise that we hit a 50% aggregate beta by the end of this year, but I would not be surprised that occurs in 2019.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then I guess just if you look at that growth and time deposits this quarter, are you seeing that as a way to attract new customers or you generally seeing it's more existing customers reallocating balances from another account?","David Rosato","Yes. So we have the large book of CDs. So we are conscious of the schedule of maturities in any period. And we're pricing competitively to attract and keep that money and then where it can generate new relationships and new activity in the franchise we benefit from that. But where as we talked about discipline pricing, we're pretty thoughtful about where we need to be in order to retain the existing relationships that we have and obviously look to have multiple products with those clients.","John Barnes","And I would just add, during the quarter, we also had some \u2013 the checking account acquisition programs that we were running and that's just kind of the way we run the business. We're always looking to onboard and attract new customers and then sometimes that will happen with the CDs, some \u2013 but we obviously much preferred if it happens with checking account.","Jared Shaw","Great, thanks a lot.","David Rosato","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks. Good evening, guys.","John Barnes","Hi, Collyn.","David Rosato","Hi, Collyn.","Collyn Gilbert","First a housekeeping item, David the $2 million or so that you guys saw in those legacy investment gains, I presume you do not anticipate that to recur or just a little bit of background on those?","David Rosato","Generally, they don't occur regularly, but once in awhile in a quarter it will happen and we call it out. What happens in this quarter as well as there's new accounting around equity securities where you have to mark them to market each quarter. So we have a legacy equity position that appreciated during the quarter and that was the driver for the most part.","Collyn Gilbert","That\u2019s right. Okay. Thank you. And then just back to the discussion on the loan growth. What are you guys anticipating for sort of paydown activity to happen? And I\u2019m sorry, I could probably do the math because you did give some color around this. But just wondering if you anticipating \u2013 if you're anticipating paydowns to sort of start to slow here in the back half of the year?","John Barnes","We'd like it to slow. It\u2019s really hard to predict in this market. I would say, we're expecting a little bit above average compared to where we've been historically just given the nature of what we've seen, not only last six months, even in the last 12 or 24 months.","A lot of our long-term holders are being approached with prices that they find hard to refuse. And in some cases, competitively, we\u2019re getting taking out by life company deals that are just really long and low, but there's definitely been more activity on that front and really hard at this point to see that shifting.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","The only thing I would add to that is, so Jack was referencing commercial real estate, which has been the real headwind that we called out, but we are seeing some of our C&I customers, merging or selling and so that's a lot more spotty, but it also happens and now it's been happening a little bit more than usual.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just thinking about the loan size of kind of the dynamics of what's going on here. Is there a big differential between some of the CRE relationships that are running off compared to the middle-market ones that you guys are adding? I would imagine that there would be, or can you quantify that at all?","Jeffrey Hoyt","Collyn, this is Jeff. Specifics to the multi-family portfolio, those tend to be small balance loan. So those loans are relatively small. The balance of our commercial real estate portfolio, I\u2019d say that the loans that we\u2019re doing are not any bigger or smaller than the loans that are getting refinance or running off.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a similar question on the deposit side. Obviously, the drop this quarter, you guys attributed to the municipals. What\u2019s kind of the average relationship size perhaps within any of those customers? Just trying that again, it's a big swing from a dollar perspective. So just curious where the concentration might be?","David Rosato","Yes. Collyn, it's really all over the board there. So we bank a few of the states, if they might want. So if you think about the state of Mass, Connecticut or Vermont, the three larger states that we bank. They can have sizable swing. But then it\u2019s a very granular portfolio of all those smaller towns throughout New England as well, so there's a real range there.","What I would say is the larger customers are the ones who impacted for the most part in dollars, in the quarter. However, this is very normal seasonal activity and then tax payments come in, in the month of July, we\u2019re already seeing those balances come back.","Collyn Gilbert","Yes. Okay and then just finally on the borrowings. So big jump in the borrowing cost there, it seems beyond even where we saw rates move? Was there any \u2013 were you doing anything spending duration or was there anything else going on with the borrowing dynamics this quarter?","David Rosato","No. There really wasn't. There was a little bit more borrowing, just temporarily borrowings to cover the deposit runoff, but there was a not a change in strategy on our part.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","David Rosato","Thank you.","John Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Barnes for any closing remarks.","John Barnes","Thank you. Strong second quarter was highlighted by our announced agreement to acquire First Connecticut Bancorp and the acquisition of Vend Lease company. Another quarter of record earnings, net interest margin expansion benefiting from the increase in loan yields, continuing to outpace the rise in deposit costs, improvement in operating leverage, driven by continued revenue growth and well-controlled expenses, stronger lending activity in June and solid period-end pipeline and our continued commitment to a consistent return of capital to shareholders and evidenced by the Board of Directors declaring a common stock dividend for the 100 consecutive quarters.","Thank you for your interest in People\u2019s United.

Good afternoon, thank you everyone for joining us today.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to the overview on slide 2. The company\u2019s strong second quarter results reflect our ongoing commitment to deliver exceptional service to clients and profitable growth to shareholders.","Net income was $69.3 million or $0.19 per common share. These results include merger related expenses of $24.8 million or $0.05 per common share. On an operating basis earnings were $82.6 million an increase of 21% from both the first quarter and the prior year quarter and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 10.9%.","Operating earnings per share were $0.24 up $0.02 linked-quarter and a penny from a year ago. The quarter benefited from the Suffolk acquisition and continued net interest margin expansion resulting from higher yield on new business and re-pricing of floating rate loans. Additionally we achieved further improvement in operating leverage, organic loan growth and sustained exceptional asset quality across our diverse portfolio of businesses.","We continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio through revenue growth and thoughtful expense management. Revenues grew 10% and 13% respectfully from the first quarter and prior year quarter driven by both higher net interest income and fee revenues aided by the addition of Suffolk. Net interest income benefited from the net interest margin expanding 14 basis points from the most recent quarter.","Period end loan and deposit balances increased 26% and 17% respectively on an annualized basis from the end of the first quarter largely due to the Suffolk acquisition. Loan growth also benefited from a rebound and mortgage warehouse lending balances and solid organic growth in the commercial real estate portfolio. On an average balance basis both loans and deposits increased 28% annualized for the quarter.","In wealth management discretionary assets grew 12% annualized during the quarter primarily due to market performance and net client inflows. Looking ahead we remain optimistic about the opportunities in the second half of the year. At June 30, loan pipelines in both our commercial and retail lending segments were solid and improved from the previous quarter end. While the industry landscape remains competitive we continue to benefit from deep long term client relationships.","Similar to comments I made last quarter our view is that our commercial clients are cautiously optimistic about the underlying economic environment. There is an overwhelming desire to see Washington effect deregulation and tax reform which we believe will create greater economic activity.","Turning to slide 3, we are excited to announce the all cash acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, one of the largest independent commercial equipment finance companies in the United States. The addition of LEAF will diversify our equipment finance portfolio into the small ticket leasing segment and enable us to leverage LEAF\u2019s highly scalable tech-enabled origination platform. The company is a leading industry innovator in business automation as evidenced by winning the equipment leasing and finance associations operations and technology award in 2012 and 2016. LEAF provides financing and leasing solutions to both vendors and end users of essential use equipment. A firm offers a dual vendor and direct origination strategy with multiple industry verticals that provide diversified and consistent growth.","Since 2002, the company has financed over $5.8 billion for more than 243,000 clients nationwide, leveraging its expertise underwriting processes, technology platform and servicing capabilities. LEAF has increased originations at a compound annual growth rate of 28% since 2011 and has done so with excellent credit performance. The transaction is financially compelling as it will be immediately accretive to earnings. We expect the transaction to be a penny accretive to earnings in 2017 and $0.03 accretive to 2018.","While LEAF underwriting is consistent with People's United conservative philosophy their yields are more than two times greater than our total loan portfolio. We are very pleased LEAF season management team will join, remain in the business. With the chairman and CEO and [indiscernible], president and COO have extensive experience in the industry and under their leadership we look forward to LEAF\u2019s continued strong growth.","At closing which is expected in the third quarter and does not require bank regulatory approvals, our equipment finance units will have approximately $4 billion of assets and rank as the 16th largest bank owned equipment finance entity in the country. We look forward to welcoming the employees of LEAF Commercial Capital to the People's United family and are confident the combination will create value for both clients and shareholders.","With that I will pass it to David to discuss the second quarter results in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning to slide 4, net interest income of $274.9 million increased 11% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $28.2 million to the increase in net interest income due to higher yields on new business, re-pricing of floating rate loans, and higher average balances. The quarter also benefited $1.9 million from an additional calendar day and $1 million from higher yields in the securities portfolio. The largest offset was a $3.4 million reduction in net interest income resulting from higher deposit costs and volumes. Net interest margin improved for the second consecutive quarter.","As displayed on slide 5, the net interest margin of 296 increased 14 basis points from the first quarter. This expansion was driven by the loan portfolio which favorably impacted the margins by 15 basis points as new business yields were higher than the total portfolio yield. The addition of Suffolk contributed approximately 4 basis points to the margin expansion for the quarter.","Looking at the loan portfolio on slide 6, period end balances were $31.6 billion an increase of $1.9 billion or 26% annualized from the end of the first quarter largely due to Suffolk. Commercial loans accounted for approximately $1.7 billion of the increase, but retail balances were up over $200 million. Notably with the addition of Suffolk our New York loan portfolio is now $7.3 billion only $593 million less than Connecticut which is currently our largest market.","On an organic basis loans grew 5% annualized driven by a rebound in mortgage warehouse lending as quarter end balances were $1.2 billion up $366 million from March 31. The portfolio also benefited from favorable results in the commercial real estate portfolio as well as modest growth in retail driven by residential mortgage. Before moving to the next slide I wanted to briefly provide some color on our commercial exposure to the retail industry.","Our top 10 exposures to retail tenants are mostly supermarkets with Stop & Shop being our largest exposure as well as national drug stores and large home improvement centers. Importantly we do not have any exposure to indoor malls. Period end deposit balances up $31.8 billion increased $1.3 billion or 17% annualized during the quarter driven by Suffolk.","On slide 7, the favorable impact on the deposit mix from Suffolk\u2019s outstanding base and it\u2019s high concentration of non-interest bearing deposits is clearly same. As such the largest driver of the linked-quarter increase is the addition of nearly $900 million of non-interest bearing deposits to the portfolio.","On a business segment basis deposit balances in both commercial and retail increased during the quarter by $814 million and $495 million respectively. Excluding Suffolk deposit balances declined 7% annualized in what is typically a slower quarter for deposits. Following historical trends, we expect deposit balances to be higher in the third quarter. Additionally deposits in the coming quarter should further benefit from the Commonwealth and Massachusetts which we are currently on boarding for its core banking services.","Moving along to slide 8, non-interest income for the quarter of $91.6 million increased $6.9 million or 8% from the preceding quarter. Commercial banking lending fees account for $3.3 million of the increase primarily due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Non-interest income also benefited $1.5 million from higher bank service charges and $1.1 million from [indiscernible] income. The largest offset to these improvement was a $1.6 million decrease in insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.","On slide 9, we display the components driving the increase in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger related expenses of $24.8 million compared to $1.2 million in the first quarter. For the second quarter $10.8 million of these costs resided in professional and outside services, $3.4 million in compensation and benefits and $10.6 million in other. Excluding merger related costs non-interest expenses were $232.5 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 3% from the first quarter. The largest component of this increase was $2.5 million in hire cost related to professional and outside services due to the timing of certain projects.","Occupancy and equipment costs and compensation benefits were up $1.7 million and $1 million respectively primarily due to the addition of Suffolk. Executing on revenue producing initiatives is a key focus for the company. As Jack mentioned earlier revenues grew 10% linked quarter and 13% from a year ago. This growth along with our constant over-side expenses drove a second quarter efficiency ratio of 58.4% as displayed on slide 10. This result marks an improvement of 100 basis points and 200 basis points respectively from the first quarter and prior year quarter.","Going forward, even with the significant improvement we have made in our efficiency ratio we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage. Maintaining excellent asset quality is an important lever endowing sustainable long term value and once again we are pleased with our continued exceptional results as demonstrated on Slide 11.","Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 67 basis points remains well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Second quarter net charge offs of 9 basis points were up slightly from recent quarters but remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.","Return on average assets and return on tangible common equity matrix were unfavorably impacted by the merger related expenses in the second quarter. Therefore, looking at these matrix on an operating basis is more indicative of the company's performance this quarter.","As displayed on Slide 12, both operating return on average assets of 77 basis points and operating return on average tangible common equity of 10.9% improved from recent quarters.","Continuing now on to Slide 13, capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix, a long history of exceptional risk management.","On Slide 14, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and the yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive built slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well positioned for additional increases and interest rates. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our loan portfolio was either one month LIBOR or prime based, which was consistent with the year ago.","Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to Slide 15 as we have provided an update to our full-year 2017 goals. As you will recall, the goals we outlined in January did not include Suffolk, given the close of the acquisition was still present. This update takes into consideration the addition of Suffolk as well as people standalone results for the first half of the year.","However, it is important to note these goals do not include lead commercial capital and the acquisition has yet to close. Our updated goals are as follows. We expect loan growth to finish the year in the range of 11% to 13%, deposit growth is expected in the range of 12% to 14%. The net interest income growth range is updated to 12% to 14%.","Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.90% to 3%. Total expenses excluding merger related cost are now in the range of $930 million to $940 million. We have lowered our provision range to $25 million to $35 million from the previously announced range of $40 million to $50 million.","It is important to know the full-year goals for noninterest income growth and capital remain unchanged. In addition, the net effect of these changes does not impact our original full-year earnings expectations with respect to People's United on a standalone basis.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David. Before opening up for questions, I wanted to briefly speak about the acquisition of Suffolk which closed in early April. The integration has progressed extremely well. The outstanding efforts of our experienced teams provided seamless transition for clients. We successfully completed the core conversion in early May and are on track to realize projected year one cost saves.","The economics of the transaction remain positive and have improved over the course of the integration process. Upon announcement, we expect the transaction to be penny accretive to full-year earnings. At this time, we now project $0.02 of earnings accretion in 2018. Similar to our original modeling, this result does not include any revenue synergies. We remain optimistic in our ability to take advantage of these synergies to further enhance earnings.","Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jared Shaw","Hi, thanks a lot and good afternoon.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Jared.","Jared Shaw","Just on the LEAF acquisition, a couple of questions on that. First, is that going to be fully integrated into people's existing equipment finance business or will it be run in parallel with that? And then if you could talk a little bit of your expectations for growth should we think to that CAGR is sustainable or do you think that given the bigger balance sheet and probably a better funding profile you could actually see improved growth profile from where they have?","Jack Barnes","Sure. So, the plan is to continue to operate LEAF under its existing brand if you will and as a standalone operation. As we go forward, there may be some synergies with systems then like, but we're not planting anything there for the short term. We're very focused on continuing their momentum and having them continue to make progress.","We think that they are historical to growth rates are achievable as we move forward. There is a we know from our discussions and due diligence for them that there were some deals that met their credit standards but they didn\u2019t have the funding to do. There were some larger deals and relationships where again that funding held them back.","So, we see a lot of good potential for synergies like being a part of People's United.","Jared Shaw","Thanks. And then looking shifting over to the deposit side, excluding the impact from Suffolk. Was there more pressure on the deposit base and I guess you're expecting through deposit data and were you seeing a transition or a customer presence of shifting from DDA into interest growing deposits or was the relative weakness in the deposit trends this quarter more driven by the opportunity of bringing in the Suffolk deposits.","David Rosato","Hey Jared, it's David. So, deposits excluding Suffolk, we're down about $0.5 billion in the quarter, which is a larger outflow than we experienced last year versus the second quarter. Second quarter is normally a down quarter for us. What I would say is what's changed is our government banking business is bigger now than it has historically been, where banking a lot of North Eastern states now. On our prepared remarks we're just talking about the onboarding that's going on of the commonwealth of math.","So, when I think about that $0.5 billion ex-Suffolk decline, about $300 million of that was seasonal associated with the municipal business. About $50 million was just a reduction that we undertook in our broker deposit base. So, the core retail and commercial outflow and acquired, so we're about a $150 million. And well, definitely we expect both the municipal deposits as well as the commercial and retail to come back in the third quarter.","From a deposit pricing pressure or data, we're really not seeing any impact yet. The deposit cost which you saw up 3 basis points on a late quarter basis was really driven by the broker deposits that we have on the balance sheet, not within the resale, the core retail or core commercial deposit rate.","Jared Shaw","Okay, great, thanks. And then just finally from me, you touched on the customer sentiment given the sort of the national economy but the Connecticut economy is been in the news lately and obviously there is some challenges the state is facing and certainly that the city far for is facing. What's the customer sentiment around sort of the health of the Connecticut economy and do you think that that's going to be a bigger drag than maybe you're expecting earlier on the core Connecticut business?","Jack Barnes","Jared, its Jack. Let's say the sentiment in the customer base is a strong desire to have those elected govern and worked together to get the states fit for house in order. So, there is definitely in conversations with customers, there is a lot of strong feeling that they need to take some pretty deliberate action to get the economic environment, much stronger to retain wealthy individuals and keep them from looking elsewhere.","So, there is a lot of that sentiment and I'm hopeful that governor in the legislature will work together to balance this year's budget and try to sort of set things on a stronger course here. Hartford is from everything that we see is in pretty challenging financial condition and it really ends up with the same kind of discussion about and needing to address it.","David Rosato","The only thing I would add, Jack, is LEAF is a national business. So, with them joining us, we have four national businesses now and Connecticut is only one of six states in New England that we operate in. and our New York franchise as we said in the prepared remarks is almost on par with our Connecticut franchise which helps, which is nice diversification for us.","Jared Shaw","Great, thanks a lot. I appreciate the color.","David Rosato","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopolous of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopolous","Hello, everybody.","Jack Barnes","Hello, there.","Steven Alexopolous","I could start just few follow-ups on the LEAF field. I appreciate the earnings accretion that you guys provided. But could you share, you're talking about $0.03 of accretion 2018. What's the revenue and expense assumptions that are being made to get to the $0.03?","David Rosato","Yes. We're not ready to go there Steve. At this point we really given a size of the transaction in the relative contribution where we are not planning to give additional detail beyond our expected EPS in accretion side. And we would tell you that on an internal rate of return basis, that it's a strong high teen internal rate of return. And we're very pleased with that. We think this is a great transaction and has a lot more potential.","Steven Alexopolous","And Jack, what's your funding strategy for this growth you're going to be putting on for LEAF?","Jack Barnes","Let David address that as we kind of lay out our plans.","David Rosato","Sure, thanks Jack. So, that's really one of the drivers of this transaction is that as Jack mentioned earlier, they were in many respects funding constraint and it was impeding their ability to grow and to grow profitably. So, our upon close we expect to pay off all of their liabilities other than the $250 million securitization that we referenced in the slide.","The reason for that is just that was a recent transaction in the last few months that has a one year lock out called lock out that once where can call that without cause, we will do so. In the near term, we're going to reduce our securities portfolio and replace those assets with these assets. That's a funding strategy but that's also makes this transaction even more capital efficient.","Going forward, once the initial 735 was on to the books, you'll just see core deposit funding add of us for future growth.","Steven Alexopolous","Got you, okay. But you won't really change the size of the balance sheet then if you use its securities, correct?","David Rosato","That's correct, that's the plan.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay. And then on the Suffolk deal what were the cost saves realized in the second quarter and what\u2019s still left at this point?","Jack Barnes","What we advertised which was 50% cost saves, 75% in the first year. So we took on about $9 million of costs from them in the quarter, $8 million to $9 million.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay and were any cost saves realized at this point?","David Rosato","Yes, considerable amount and we closed the number of branches. We have gone through the conversion, all of the operational support, finance, marketing etcetera, those folks are \u2013 we have gone through the transition with personnel if you will. So we have moved through a great deal of that activity.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay, got you. And purchase accounting how much of purchase accounting accretion was there this quarter from that deal?","Jack Barnes","It was really, the impact of Suffolk in the quarter remember we said there was ad deal signing $0.01, cost saves are fully realized and now we are seeing $0.02 so you think, we are still in the 75% cost save part of this for the most part. So it's about a quarter of a penny, additional income.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay. My question was about purchase accounting accretion that would have been in net interest income in the quarter.","David Rosato","There is not much accretion above the coupon on the loans because the discount was not that great.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay, got it. Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Casey Haire","Thanks guys. Just a question on the liquidity profile creeps up to 99 here with pro forma with LEAF will go 102, it sounds like you had some deposits outflow this quarter but what\u2019s the limit there in terms of how high or you are willing to let that go and what\u2019s the strategy to drive that down?","Jack Barnes","I would bring you back Casey to my comments about the temporary outflow deposits in the second quarter and the rebound that we expect going forward. So we would expect the loan deposit ratio which has been running 99 or 100 that\u2019s where we expect to be in the third and fourth quarter of this year and really going forward the limit if you will is where we were maybe three years ago but we have no intention of going back there. Now I would just add we have tremendous amount of work going on in our marketing area and the retail bank to grow our deposits through some new approaches that we\u2019re taking to core deposit generation. Those are in motion and we also have what we call we\u2019ve increased the emphasis on deposit growth in our commercial bank including oriented incentives in that direction. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress in our commercial bank in the last couple of years, double digit improvement.","So we continue to stay focused on that. Our broader goal is to be totally core funded and leveraged relatively in the scheme of things, new position we have in New York and Boston if you will. But as we continue to grow the franchise in those big markets we expect to be in very good shape on the funding side.","Casey Haire","Okay, great and just one more on LEAF, sorry if I missed this. But the impact on tangible book and capital ratios from LEAF, have you guys disclosed that?","Jack Barnes","We have not, the capital impact to the leverage is going to be 30 basis points or so.","Casey Haire","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert of KBW. Your line is open.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks, good evening gentlemen. Just I guess, holding in on your slide with your outlook and your goals for the year, obviously a ramp up in expected growth even considering Suffolk. It gets across the board it looks like a more optimistic view of kind of your outlook there. So can you just kind of give a little bit more color as to what\u2019s driving that I guess specifically on the growth side because I think if we back out Suffolk, if we back out the mortgage warehouse I think loans would have been flat or maybe even slightly down. I know you gave great color there David on the deposit side but just trying to reconcile a lot of the trends that we\u2019re hearing from other banks in terms slowing growth, but yet it seems like you\u2019re accelerating your outlook. So maybe talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that?","David Rosato","Yes. Well, we did have a bit of a mixed quarter outside of talking organic care obviously and excluding Suffolk we had a mixed performance across the portfolios. We had I would say pretty steady growth in areas like the middle market portfolio. A lot of that was driven by improvement and increased line utilization. The ABL business was up, the whole fed group was up little more modestly.","So we had businesses that were doing fine but we also had seasonal declines in portfolios like the municipal business and historically we have had pay downs in municipal books in Connecticut and Vermont. We experienced that. We also really decided that we were not going to chase spreads lower in certain of our PCLC business so that book actually had some declines, this quarter we had activity but we had some declines there. We had some large [indiscernible] on some large commercial payoffs that were driven more by insurance companies and similar folks coming into the market and being pretty aggressive.","So we lost some of our balances there and we backed off a little bit on our shorter term residential on the jumbo side. Again, we changed our pricing to be a little more favorable to the bank and so the growth origination slowed. So we have made some moves in terms of not chasing lower yields and titer spreads up and we\u2019ve had some seasonality in things like the municipal business.","So we are optimistic as I said in the comments, the pipelines are in good shape. We feel good about the second half. Historically, our second half is much stronger than the first so that\u2019s where it comes from.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just on the onboarding of Massachusetts, can you quantify that, what you expect that deposit relationship to be?","David Rosato","Sure, once that deposit relationship is completely onboard it\u2019ll be approximately $300 million to $350 million.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful and then just finally, just looking on LEAF was that just a origin of that deal, was that a negotiated transaction or a bid transaction, is this folks that you guys have known for a while or just curious a little bit about the background?","David Rosato","We have known them for a while, actually met them at a conference over a year ago I think and they know us as well. They were very familiar with our equipment finance businesses and I would say yes, it was a process and we got involved and worked our way down to just a couple parties and we\u2019re the one selected. And probably the most intense part of that was over the last three or four months I think that\u2019s \u2013 ","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful. I will leave it there, thank you.","David Rosato","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Matthew Breese of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew Breese","Thanks for taking my questions guys. How are you doing? I just wanted to get your thoughts relative to M&A now that the Suffolk deal is completed and your incremental close to $50 billion. At what point do you shy away from the smaller deals and move more towards the bigger deals or is there a point, just wanted to talk on those issues?","Jack Barnes","Sure. So I guess I would put it this way. We kind of view the $50 billion issue the same today as we did before the LEAF field announced to continue to do the preparation, we\u2019ve been describing to you. We\u2019ve actually had more conversations with our regulators and have made them more familiar with the efforts that we\u2019re making around our 50-B project and in addition to that just having more conversation about all the aspects of that including our dividend. And I would say our view toward M&A today is similar. It\u2019s very, very small deals or something I think we would shy away from but I\u2019d say if you look at our history if we see good opportunities and we see something that makes sense and is valuable to our shareholder we\u2019re willing to talk about it. And $50 billion will not be the reason that we\u2019re not going to do something.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And can you update us as far as how far long in the CCAR process in terms of infrastructure built out systems how far long are you?","Jack Barnes","I think we have described that previously probably more than people want to know but we are very well along. We have talent in the company that has experience in [indiscernible] filing. We have strengthened our models. We have built our debt covenants and strengthened our infrastructure if you will around for that process and we are feeling very good about that. David has led the charge on that I don't know if there is anything you would add, but \u2013","David Rosato","No, I would say, we have been talking about this since Jack referenced for a long time but we have been plugging away at it for quite a few years and incrementally up in our capability, resources. And so, I just back Jack's comments we are not going to let the $50 billion line impede something that's good for customers and good for shareholders. We are rooting for representative [indiscernible] this morning and we like the introduction of that bill.","Matthew Breese","On off being equal is what's needed on the infrastructure side is that something you can still tuck into organic expense growth or do you think there will be any sort of acceleration over the coming years as you get incrementally closer?","Jack Barnes","I would just think of it as tucked into organic expense growth. You followed us for a long period of time as have the others on the phone and we spent a lot of time on the expense side of this company for many years now and we have gotten our efficiency ratio which we like to talk about this quarter for example down in the upper 50s. We continue to focus to control costs and to build out our capabilities at a proper speed or the environment that we are operating in. we don't want to go overboard today for instance because a lot of this might fall away and we shouldn't be spending money on it. But long term infrastructure things like data governance we are working hard on it and it's in our run rate.","Matthew Breese","Understood. Last one, I noticed the tax rate ticked up just a hair from last quarter what should we be using there?","Jack Barnes","Yes, it ticked up a little bit what I would say is it was just artificially a little low in the first quarter. It's normalized to the guidance that we had originally given which was 32 on a quarter.","Matthew Breese","Okay, understood that's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Eric Zwick of Stephens. Your line is open.","Eric Zwick","Good evening guys.","Jack Barnes","Good evening, hi Eric.","Eric Zwick","Maybe just the first question on credit and I appreciate the color you gave on your commercial real estate kind of retail exposure and then prepared comments. Just looking at the tables quick commercial real estate non-performers were up about $20 million or so this quarter. Just any color into what you are seeing in that portfolio, what drove the increase?","Jack Barnes","Yes. So, I will start with reminding you that our non-performers and net charge off in that book of business are extremely low and have been historically. That said, that number is up and basically it's driven by just the couple of credits that had events that lease expirations and like and we have them on performing for all the right cautious reasons. We are working them through workout and we think we are properly reserved and actually work through them in a pretty timely way.","Eric Zwick","Maybe just one question on LEAF and I know you are not ready to provide quantitative expectations for revenue yet. But any colors to the split of revenue between interest income and then fee income in that business?","Jack Barnes","It's primarily interest income. So they do generate nice fees.","Eric Zwick","And then something they potentially have done some securitization in the past would you choose to pretty much hold originations going forward?","Jack Barnes","Yes. As I said earlier we are going to terminate their wholesale borrowing arrangement and clear securitization other than $250 million or so which they just recently did that is not callable for the first year.","Eric Zwick","Great, thanks for taking my questions.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen since there are no further questions in the queue I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing we are pleased with the company's performance in the quarter which was highlighted by the successful closing and integration of the Suffolk transaction, operating earnings growth of 21%, net interest margin expansion for the second consecutive quarter. Further improvement in operating leverage driven by higher revenues, organic loan growth and sustain exceptional asset quality across our diversified portfolio of businesses. Looking ahead we remain optimistic about the opportunities in the second half including completing the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital. Thank you for your interest in People\u2019s United, have a good night.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to share my views on our recent -- on our current strategic positioning. As has been the case, since I took over as CEO 3 years ago, we are, consistent with our conservative approach, building this franchise for the long term. We are forming new relationships and deepening existing relationships across our geographic footprint while providing our customers with a broad set of solutions to their financial needs. Ultimately, we are shareholders and our choices are designed to maximize shareholder return, not only in the near term but over the medium and long term. We feel good about the progress we've made and the opportunities for future progress.","Now with respect to our second quarter results. On Slide 2, operating earnings were $62.4 million and net income was $62.1 million, each equating to $0.20 per share. The net interest margin declined by 5 basis points to 3.33% compared to 3.38% in the first quarter.","As I mentioned last quarter, we believe that our net interest margin has now largely stabilized. The margin for the first 6 months was 3.35%, which was in line with our full year margin guidance that we provided in January of 3.30% to 3.40%. This should allow net interest income to grow at a pace similar to our growth in earning assets.","We are very pleased that the end-of-period loans grew at 13% annualized rate in the second quarter. This marks our 11th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and our customers.","Further, our pipelines remain strong and runoff in the acquired portfolio has slowed, as we predicted in January. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.7% from 64.1% in the first quarter, primarily due to revenue growth. Expected growth in net interest income combined with fee income expansion and expense control will produce efficiency ratio progress in the quarters ahead.","Asset quality remains strong, with net charge-offs below 20 basis points. As mentioned before, we firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow a balance sheet.","We continue to optimize capital through share repurchases and dividend payments. We were, once again, opportunistic this past quarter, repurchasing 11.2 million shares at a weighted average price of $13.63.","During the first 6 months of 2013, we repurchased 22.4 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $13.30 per share. We believe we have captured compelling returns with these repurchases, with the tangible book value dilution earnback period of approximately 5 years.","In addition, the repurchases have improved our future dividend payout ratio, return on average tangible equity and earnings per share. Capital ratios remain solid, especially in light of our relatively low-risk business model and are now close to peer median levels on a tangible equity to tangible asset basis.","With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.33% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, first quarter operating net interest margin was 3.38%. New loan volume impacted our margin by 5 basis points. Loan repricing and amortization as well as increased borrowings each had a negative impact of 1 basis point. This was offset by one more calendar day in the second quarter, which benefited the margin by 2 basis points.","In the quarters ahead, we'll be working hard to increase the mix of demand deposit accounts to help offset some of the decline in loan yields.","As Jack mentioned earlier, we anticipate that our net interest margin has now largely stabilized, having worked through significant levels of acquired loan runoff and over 4 years of repricing on the originated portfolio.","Slide 4 provides a breakdown in the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $705 million, or 12.7% annualized. This is a testament to our expanded footprint, as well as progress in our heritage markets and strengthened product lineup. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $201 million this quarter compared to $155 million in the first quarter of 2013. The acquired loan portfolio runoff is expected to remain at these lower levels for the balance of the year given our resolution of significant problem assets, continued portfolio seasoning and longer duration on the remaining assets.","Originated loan growth for the quarter total approximately $906 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Commercial real estate contributed 66% of total originated loan growth, or $595 million, including $515 million from New York commercial real estate. The portfolio remains broadly diversified, with most relationships well below $25 million.","C&I contributed 9%, or $78 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across many categories, including asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending and equipment finance. Our municipal business tends to be seasonally lower in the second quarter as fiscal year-end activity negatively impacts loan and deposit balances. The actual business fundamentals within this customer base remain strong and it is merely a timing issue.","Excluding the change in municipal loans, C&I would have contributed $134 million, or 14% of total originated loan growth. Residential mortgages contributed 16%, or $145 million of originated loan growth, in the second quarter. Approximately 94% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The residential mortgage pipeline is up 5% quarter-over-quarter and 69% of the pipeline is jumbo product.","New home equity commitments totaled $225 million compared to $182 million in the first quarter of 2013. It is important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail originated, with 65% in a first-lien position.","You can see on Slide 5 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Retail deposits increased by $18 million, while commercial deposits increased $172 million. It should be noted that we typically see lighter retail balances in the second quarter, primarily due to customer tax payments.","As mentioned earlier, the seasonality in our municipal business had a negative impact on commercial deposits in the second quarter. If we exclude the change in municipal deposits, total deposits would've increased $267 million, or 5% quarter-over-quarter annualized.","We continue to focus on improving the mix of our deposit base. Efforts throughout our franchise, lower deposit costs, particularly in acquired markets, contributed to a further decline in deposit cost of 38 basis points. The larger deposit opportunities relate to acquired deposits, continuing to increase our deposit mix in favor of noninterest-bearing deposits and a better utilization of our Southern New York branches. Acquired deposits represent 14% of total deposits. The weighted average cost is 71 basis points. Over time, the rates and mix of deposits and acquired markets will benefit from our franchise-wide emphasis on growing demand deposits. Over the last year, our acquired deposit costs have declined 17 basis points, or approximately 20%.","On Slide 6, we provide a brief update on the Southern New York branches that we acquired from Citizens on June 25, 2012. Average in-store deposits per branch have more than doubled, from $4 million at close to $9 million in the second quarter of 2013. Originally, we anticipated these branches would reach the breakeven point of $10 million of deposits in June 2014. We see a significant opportunity to bring the average deposits per branch up to the levels in our Connecticut in-store branches.","On an activity basis, meaning from the customer's physical banking location, our Connecticut in-store branches average approximately $44 million in deposits per branch. This transaction has benefited more than just our deposit-gathering capabilities. The branches provide significant support to our commercial lending efforts and strengthened brand awareness in the New York metro area. The income businesses, such as wealth management, brokerage, insurance, merchant and payroll services, have all benefited from our expanded presence in this market.","For the New York market as a whole, we have generated $46 million of mortgage loans and $70 million of home equity loans year-to-date, which represent approximately 40% and 200% improvements, respectively, over the prior year period. We currently have approximately 240 mortgage-certified and 300 consumer-loan-certified branch employees in New York.","Noninterest income grew 13.7% over the prior year period as business leaders and relationship managers continue to bring our customer focus banking model to our expanded geographic footprint. As mentioned before, we believe we are in the early stages of this process.","As shown on Slide 7, on a linked quarter basis, net -- noninterest income increased $3.2 million from an already strong first quarter level. Bank service charges were seasonally stronger, adding $2 million to the growth this quarter, while customer-derivative income increased $1.1 million. Loan prepayment fees and gains on loan sales decreased by $3.2 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Gain on acquired loan sales contributed $5.8 million to the growth this quarter, which is partially attributable to 3 loans in the Smithtown portfolio. Insurance revenue decreased $1.2 million. As a reminder, the second and fourth quarters tend to be seasonally weaker for this business.","On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of our changes in noninterest expense. From an operating expense perspective, compensation and benefit expenses decreased $2.8 million, primarily due to lower payroll taxes, while occupancy and equipment costs fell $1 million. Net REO costs were higher by $2 million, primarily due to one large single-family residence in Fairfield County. Advertising and promotion expenses increased $1.9 million, which was driven by the timing of advertising campaigns. We also experienced higher professional and outside services costs. The net impact of the nominal $1.4 million increased on the operating expenses for the quarter.","The next slide details our progress on the efficiency ratio since the first quarter of 2010. As you can see, we have made significant progress over this time period.","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.33% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and top 50 banks and are down from 1.67% in the second quarter of 2012. Acquired nonperforming loans are not included in these calculations due to the accounting rules. However, it is worth noting that we are very pleased with their performance, as we have seen these balances decline $78 million, or 33%, to $159 million in the current quarter from $237 million a year ago.","Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs remain low at 19 basis points compared to 24 basis points last quarter and 26 basis points 1 year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge-offs, net charge-offs this quarter were 18 basis points. These levels continue to reflect minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets and are well below peers.","Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 54% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","Now, I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality.","Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 19% and 15%, respectively. Operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 81 basis points, up from 77 basis points in the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by our larger balance sheet, particularly our investment portfolio. Progress will be driven by loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and a disciplined approach to expenses.","As rates begin to return to more historically normal levels, our asset-sensitive balance sheet is expected to positively impact future earnings.","Slide 14 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued progress in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our capital levels remain approximately 70 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity to tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that our return on average tangible equity is 11%.","On Slide 15, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain strong, with a tangible common equity ratio at 8.7% and Tier 1 common at 10.8%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.2%, respectively.","We continue to take actions to grow relationships, increase fee income, reduce cost and return capital to shareholders while we strategically invest in the business for the years ahead. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform allows us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, we are well positioned to benefit from increasing interest rates.","This concludes our presentation. Now, we'll be happy to answer questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill and Partners.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First question I have relates to the buyback. Assuming you were to complete your buyback in the next quarter or so, your TCE ratio would be sort of hovering around 8%. Are additional buybacks likely in your mind at that point?","Kirk W. Walters","The guidance that we've been giving, I think, consistently throughout the year has been that we are not expecting additional buybacks after this one is completed.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then, secondly, Jack, you had said the earnback on the buyback was about 5 years, but I'm having trouble reconciling these numbers a little bit. If, for simplicity, you sort of said this quarter tangible book went down by $0.34 almost entirely due to the buyback, that would imply almost $0.07 of earnings pickup from this and that would suggest that earnings go up by almost 10% as a result of the buyback you did this most recent quarter. That seems like a very high number. What am I missing?","Peter Goulding","Mark, this is Peter Goulding. We've spoken about this a little bit in the past. I think your horizon is a little bit shorter than ours. We're looking at the earnings pickup over a couple of year period.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","So you would earn back the $0.34 in tangible book dilution within 5 years?","Peter Goulding","That's right.","Kirk W. Walters","The calculation we used is consistent of what we had used for acquisitions and that we've consistently used in prior acquisition. So we'll be happy, once the call gets done today, to go through that with you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kirk, could you walk through this Slide 18 with us on your interest rate profile and maybe you can tell us what changed this quarter in reducing the benefit under the twist? And then where in the balance sheet within loan portfolios you're seeing the most benefit right now as the curve steepens?","Kirk W. Walters","The primary reason for the change in the reduced value from the twist is the fact that interest rates are up as of 6\/30. I mean this is -- as you remember, this is information that we've given in our 10-Q. Historically, we did move it up here. This is not -- this is runoff of the rates at 6\/30. So embedded in that is already the higher interest rate curve, which means that when you're shocking rates again that the benefit's a little less in terms of what comes through. So for the twist, we do this twist of a increase of rates of 100 basis points at the 18-month point on the yield curve in general with where rates have moved. We do believe that there will be some additional benefit, but that is more backloaded as we project out 12 months and it's really more of a positive for '14 versus '13. And we think we're still a little early in this rate rise in terms of what's occurred with it.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so I guess as your thinking about your margin stabilizing, are you getting most of your benefit from CDs? I guess it looks like you still probably have a fair amount of risk or -- or roll down in your CRE and C&I yields.","Kirk W. Walters","Well, now we've -- I think we've been pretty clear on this in the past. Really the biggest impact of driving loan yields down at this point is the fact that we've had terrific success at originating loans, and they are coming on at a rate that is still slightly less than where the portfolio is. So you've got to remember, in our portfolio, we have the acquired loans in there that are in there at a higher rate. So that's why we break out in the waterfall the impact of repricing and amortization, which is only 1 basis point. So continued success, which we're expecting to have on the ability to originate loans and grow loans, will continue to put some level of pressure on the margin to a point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Kirk, just to follow up on the comment. So I just wanted to try to reconcile the comments in the press release of large -- the NIM largely stabilizing but yet sort of continued downward pressure. So are you suggesting a couple of basis points a quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","I think we're basically talking about that we gave guidance of $3.30 to $3.40, right, in January? We publicly came out and gave guidance. And so far, that's for the year and we're at $3.35 through the first 6 months, so we're right square in the middle of that range. For the quarter itself, it's around $3.33. And we do expect to -- as I just mentioned in the prior question, as we continue to have good success in the loan front, that we could see that drift a little lower from where it's at currently as we go into the third and fourth quarters. In the third quarter, you have an additional day, so you pick up a little bit there. But the primary driver of any pressure on that is really coming from our success at growing loans.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And just the -- you had mentioned that the new loan originations are coming in a little bit lower than your portfolio yield. Can you give a little bit more color on the structure and the rate on your new CRE credits? I mean...","Kirk W. Walters","We haven't publicly put numbers out in terms of the new loan originations in terms of overall yields. Like I say, we do put information out regarding the accretion, the amount of accretion that's coming through that you can adjust yields for, and it gets you relatively close to where stuff is coming on at. In the case of structure, I'm not quite sure what your question is there.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess, is it 5-year paper, is it -- that amortizes over 30-year and the pricing resets every 5 years? Is it 7-year -- I'm just trying to, I guess, get a sense more on term, maybe is the better question than structure.","John P. Barnes","Well, I'll answer that, Collyn. It's Jack. So I would say in terms of our approach to the business, I think having changed not only recently, but they haven't changed over quite some time. So the types of commercial real estate deals we're doing and the normal approach to structure and term are consistent. And the market is certainly competitive for sure. And if there is pressure -- if there had been pressure in the last 6 months or so, it would be on rate mostly. We don't compromise our underwriting, but we'll see what happens with the rate term in terms of the intermediate rates changing here in the last 1.5 months or so and what that means on the pricing.","Kirk W. Walters","Collyn, back to your question on overall yields. I mean we have in the past talked a little bit about spreads because commercial bankers, it's the way we think. And if you look at overall spreads on the new originations increase, they're probably around 2.25 over whatever is the matched term in terms of mid-swaps, that kind of thing. So it has gotten a little tighter, as Jack indicated, but still, all in all, a reasonable number.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And are you still comfortable with the 55% efficiency target by the end of the fourth quarter of next year?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, that's the guidance that we gave in January and we continue to work very hard to get to that. That's a 55% on a run rate in the fourth quarter.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And just a final question on capital. You guys will be at a point where you've probably, by the end of the year, have levered -- fully leveraged your excess capital. How are you thinking about capital management going into 2014? I mean, do you want to get into a position or do you want to start to build again? Just sort of trying to think -- understand how you think about capital from that point? And funding of future growth, I guess, at the same time, too, and expanding balance sheet. Is that -- does that come out of the securities portfolio? Or do you -- or were you focused on rebuilding capital? Just curious about that.","Kirk W. Walters","Let me answer. You have multiple questions there, so let me try to hit upon a couple and then I'll have to go on to somebody else's questions. I think to the first question of capital that we are very happy to see that we are finally getting close to being normalized. And we do expect that when we finish this buyback coupled with the growth that we're experiencing in the balance sheet that we will be normalized with the peer group that we've defined in terms of capital. And capital management from there forward, I think, is still the many levers that we always talk about and we think about. First and foremost, it's about growing loans and deposits, growing our balance sheet, building customer relationships; second, continuing a strong dividend; third, that we always think about that if we don't have needs for the capital about how what's the most efficient way to return it to the shareholders; and probably the last or possibility is smaller M&A stuff, different things around there. So at this point, I think we feel good about getting the capital normalized in the way that we've done it in a thoughtful, careful way that we've deployed it over time and then we'll manage it in the same group of levers as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about -- I know you don't want to give specific pricing updates on commercial real estate or multi-family. But we basically had a move in the tenure here since April of 60 or 70 basis points. Just how much of that benefit has passed through on incremental commercial real estate, multi-family loan pricing have you seen?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, as I've mentioned in the past, I mean, we're really very focused at spreads over whatever is the underlying maturity. So if it's a 5-year and the 5-year moved x basis points, we would be looking to pass that through no different than if there was a 7 or a 10. So we'd really think about it in terms of spreads and wherever the underlying indices are. If they moved up and such, that we would be looking to pass the bulk of that through.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And where is the warehouse loan balanced in now, and what's your outlook for that business? Are you still adding relationships and how should we be thinking about that?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, our warehouse loan balance grew a little bit from first quarter. It's about $750 million at this point, up from just a little under $700 million at the first quarter. We continue in that business to add commitments and add new customers, and also working on and expanding lines to existing customers. We know at this point the utilization rate is relatively high. In the business, we would expect that to moderate down as the business slows. And in general, we feel pretty good that as the new customers are coming in, that they're making up for some of that what we'll probably give up in utilization rate as we get later in the year and into next year and mortgage refinancing slows down.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you've had some borrowings during the quarter. What types of borrowings, term and rate, did you get?","Kirk W. Walters","We haven't put the rate out there, but in general, the borrowings we're doing are either FHLB borrowings or, in some cases, Fed [indiscernible] and shorter borrowings.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And last question, what should we be using for tax rate? Any changes as you've added more business in New York and some higher state-tax-rate locations?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, we generally view you should use a tax rate around 33%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","This is Tom for Bob. I just -- I wanted to circle back to Collyn's question about the efficiency ratio. On the 55% efficiency target, kind of given where we stand today with the economic environment and where rates are, how much of that improvement in efficiency is going to be revenue enhancements versus kind of cost saves?","Kirk W. Walters","The bulk of the improvement in the efficiency is, in fact, driven by revenue enhancements and it really comes from what we've talked about at length, which is growing a bigger balance sheet by continuing to grow loans and deposits, which we've had very good success in terms of the loan growth. There will be some continued we'll be always working on. It's our life's work in terms of reducing our absolute level of cost, and we'll continue to be working on that. But more of it is coming from the revenue side and really believe that we can continue to grow our loan portfolio at a good solid rate.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then kind of switching gears and moving over to the provision. I would've thought that provision would have been a little higher this quarter in light of the strong growth that you had. I mean, how should we kind of think about reserves to loans going forward now that it's kind of hovering around the 80-basis-point level?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think what you have to do, we give information in our slide deck, and I'm sure you have, that really looks at the loan portfolio broken down, the -- or the allowance broken down between commercial and retail because it's very different. And I think there's a couple of factors going on. And I would remind everybody that the first quarter, and we clearly called it out, that we had an impairment charge flow through on the acquired loan, which costs us about $2.6 million. So really our provisioning in terms of our basic portfolios is basically flat quarter-to-quarter. And what we see happening right now is, first, we continue to see nonperformers going down. So we have excellent coverage in terms of our allowance. And we're also continuing to see, as the economy improves, overall loan credit rating improving. And that coupled with the NPLs going down, in fact, provides some additional allowance that can go to the loan growth. So we do factor in, every quarter when we do the allowance, we go through a pretty detailed process. We're factoring in all of the new loans coming on and what loan ratings and everything they're at. So I think the fact that we continue to see improvement in quality, not only in NPLs but also in the overall credit ratings on the portfolio as a whole, is what provides the -- a little bit of room in terms of the provisioning.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then one last quick one. How much of your warehouses is purchase versus refi?","Kirk W. Walters","I don't -- Bob, I don't have that number right off in terms -- right off my head. I mean, obviously, the warehouse portfolio is one, as mentioned before, this is where, on a commercial basis, we are lending to mortgage companies. And so your question have to go to the companies as to how much of those particular companies are underlying refi purchase, and I don't have that in front of me.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So just a quick question on the fee side of things and on the expense side. The other lines both kind of went the wrong way a little bit, worked against you this quarter. I was just wondering what was the driver and what kind of run rate can we expect from those lines, both the other fees and other expenses?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, and I think we pointed it out. In the other noninterest income, that's where the prepayment fees roll up into. We don't include...","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So that's the 3.5%?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, we don't include prepayment fees in our margin. I know some people do, but we don't. So the drop there is really just the prepayment fees quarter-over-quarter. And down under other noninterest expense, the overall numbers that we have there, the drop -- are you referring to the drop in $38 million to $35 million? Is that the...?","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, but there was -- wasn't there a write-down in the last quarter that really inflated that number?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the -- we had additional REO this quarter, REO expense this quarter of a couple of million. And then we -- this line is made up of a whole ton of items. But in particular, the -- if you look back to last quarter, we did have the onetime charges that we took for the nonoperating that flowed through. And I think that's back -- if you go all the way in the press release back to -- I think, it'd be around 17 where we reconciled our efficiency ratio, you'll see the write-down of the banking house assets, about $6.2 million. So if you take the $6.2 million there and offset the $2 million in REO, it's about $4.2 million in round numbers. And that's the reason for the drop.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got you, okay. And then just lastly, any update on what you're seeing in terms of M&A chatter in your footprint? Any -- has the bid act [ph] between buyers and sellers narrowed at all?","John P. Barnes","Really no update. Our perspective, things haven't changed for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Alonso with Macquarie.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Just real quick on the buyback in terms of sort of pacing. You were obviously more opportunistic here in the second quarter and got in ahead of what has been a pretty good rise in the stock price. Are you sort of -- is your intention to just buy back -- to finish that buyback this year almost irregardless of price, or will you continue to be opportunistic?","Kirk W. Walters","No, we'll continue to be opportunistic. I mean, we, in general, believe that we will -- and continue to believe that we'll finish the buyback this year. But it will clearly be subject to the market conditions. And we need to remember, we're doing the buyback for a variety of reasons. I mean, obviously, the financial returns where we have been able to buy back or the tangible book value of around 5 years has been certainly compelling. But -- and also what was driving it was to get a lower dividend payout ratio. Obviously, it helps on the earnings side and really getting our capital normalized to the peers in terms of helping you in the market trading. So no different than any other capital strategy we would use. We will be very thoughtful about how we continue to finish the existing authorization for the 11 million shares.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then just 2 quick questions on the fee side. The customer derivatives, the increase that you guys called out, is that something that you expect to see continue given the move in rates? And maybe you have some guys who had floating rate loans that now suddenly want to convert to fixed because there's a fear that, that rates are going to move away from them. And then just secondly, kind of similar on the pace. Do you think the rise in rates has an impact on that, and maybe that other line continues to trend down a little bit?","Kirk W. Walters","On the customer derivative income, to be honest, the activity has just been better really over the last year and particularly better this year. And I think it's -- the reality of that we've moved into these geographies and the Boston market, the New York market, that you tend to have a little bigger loans, you probably tend to have a little more sophisticated customers or customers that are used to using interest rate swaps on their loans, and there's been more demand for them. So I don't think it's, in particular, a customer running out of concern of rate rises right now. But it's been more that we have seen more demand for it in the flow and we've been much more actively marketing our capabilities here.","John P. Barnes","Yes, totally.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on prepays, any -- I mean, do you -- any sort of impact that you expect from the move in rates there?","Kirk W. Walters","I'm sorry, I -- you cut out there.","John P. Barnes","I think on prepayment fees and any change in pace that we would affect.","I really don't see any. I think a lot of folks that are -- that have gone through the exercise of thinking about whether they were willing to absorb the prepayment fees and refi in the market has started to move through the cycle here. There certainly continues to be some activity, but it doesn't feel like it'll change too much to the upside. It may slow down.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you for joining us today.

My name is Kate and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Hoyt, our Controller as well as other members of management are here with me to review the first quarter of 2015 results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our Web site, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew.","Good morning. We appreciate everybody joining us today. Our performance this quarter is an encouraging start to the year especially given the persistent low interest rate environment as well as the severe winter weather across our markets. Results once again benefited from the investments we have made and continue to make in talent, products and services within our large and attractive markets.","During the quarter, I spend a great deal of time visiting customers across our franchise and came away impressed with the opportunities we have to further deepen these relationships through cross-selling efforts. Our breadth of products and services superior customer service and local knowledge uniquely position us to not only meet the expanding needs of current customers, but also forge new relationships. These visits reaffirm for me the value we provide to customers and the significant opportunities we have before us.","Turning to the overview of the quarter on Slide 2, operating earnings increased 12% from a year ago to $63 million making the highest level of operating earnings we have had in the first quarter of any year. Revenues increased 1% from the fourth quarter as non-interest income was higher and net interest income was flat.","As a reminder, net interest income along with net interest margin were unfavorably impacted by two fewer calendar days in the first quarter. In comparison to the prior year quarter revenues increased 3% driven by improvements in both net interest income and non-interest income.","As expected, operating expenses were modestly higher as compared to the fourth quarter due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll-related and winter-related operational costs. However, we were pleased operating expense levels remained flat compared to the prior-year quarter especially considering the continued impact of strategic investments and increasing regulatory compliance costs. The efficiency ratio increased slightly to 61.9% in the first quarter from 61.3% last quarter reflecting higher revenues and a seasonal up tick in operating expenses. However, the ratio improved from 63.9% in the prior year quarter.","While the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period, we achieved solid annualized loan growth of 5%. This marks the 18th consecutive quarter of loan growth. We are pleased with the success of our deposit gathering initiatives as evidenced by organic deposit growth of $1 billion in the quarter, which represents more than 17% growth on an annualized basis. As we further develop our franchise wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth. Asset quality was once again exceptional as net charge offs and non-performing assets improved from already low levels.","With that I will pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack.","On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter change in net interest income. Higher average balances and strong originated loan growth increased net interest income by $3.4 million and $2.8 million respectively. The largest offset to these increases was a $3.3 million reduction in net interest income due to two fewer calendar days in the first quarter. Additionally, a decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and increased deposit volume lowered net interest margin by $1.7 million and $1.1 million respectively. As mentioned on previous calls, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign looking to the quarters ahead.","On Slide 4, net interest margin for the first quarter was 2.91%, a decline of 9 basis points from the fourth quarter. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, fewer calendar days impacted the margin by 5 basis points in the first quarter. Additionally, new loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. We continue to expect the full-year 2015 margin to be within the range of $2.85 to $2.95 as outlined in January.","Slide 5 provides a breakdown of the increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $337 million or 5% annualized. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $430 million. As in previous quarters, growth was well-balanced from a product and geographic perspective.","C&I contributed $240 million of the total originated loan growth while commercial real estate contributed $118 million. Within C&I, we experienced particular strength in our mortgage warehouse lending business. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages contributed $129 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. Approximately 90% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were high-grade adjustable-rate mortgages.","In addition, the residential mortgage pipeline is strong and ended the quarter at the highest level in two years. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $93 million this quarter compared to $129 million in the fourth quarter and $114 million in the prior year quarter. The balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $958 million.","Slide 6 shows the growth in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Deposits increased over $1 billion or 15.5% on an annualized basis as commercial and retail deposits grew $635 million and $377 million respectively. Brokered deposits ended the quarter at $2.6 billion unchanged from the end of the fourth quarter. As such, the deposit growth in the first quarter was organically driven. We experienced strong growth across all geographies and all business lines.","Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposits. It is worth noting that our loan to deposit ratio was 99% at March 31 and our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with the progress we are making gathering deposits. We firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships and we continue to focus on organic deposit growth.","On Slide 7 we take a closer look at non-interest income. Non-interest income grew 3% from the fourth quarter and was primarily driven by strong commercial banking lending fees, higher customer interest rate swap income as well as gains on the sale of loans, which was primarily driven by the sale of one loan from the acquired portfolio. The increase in non-interest income was partially offset by the absence of security gains and lower bank service charges. As you will recall in the fourth quarter, the net security gain resulted from the call of a single acquired security.","On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expense during the quarter. Non-operating expenses increased over $5 million, which is mainly attributable to branch closure costs. We closed eight branches during the first quarter as we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel. Since the beginning of 2011, we have closed 44 branches which were mostly traditional branches. During the same period, we opened 24 branches many of which are more cost efficient in-store branches. We expect to close approximately 10 more branches during the remainder of the year as well as to look for opportunities to reduce real estate costs further by consolidating other facilities. We are committed to branches as they provide valuable support to revenue generating activities across all of our business lines.","From an operating perspective, expenses increased $4.5 million from the fourth quarter. Compensation and benefits increased $6.6 million primarily due to traditionally higher first quarter payroll related and benefit costs while occupancy and equipment costs increased $2.4 million of which approximately half was due to higher snow removal costs. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.","The next Slide details our efficiency ratio of the last five quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the first quarter, the results are still generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from the first quarter of 2014. An important area of focus for the organization is to continue to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 80 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2014.","Looking at Slide 11, net charge offs remained low at 11 basis points and improved from 13 basis points last quarter and 12 basis points one year ago. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.","Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 9% and 14% respectively.","As shown on slide 13, operating return on average assets decreased 4 basis points from last quarter but improved 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2014. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment and the effective initiatives that have not yet attained expected levels of operating leverage. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.","Slide 14 illustrates our return on average tangible equity. As profitability improves, we expect to see continued progress on this metric over time as we have seen in recent quarters.","Turning to Slide 15, we are comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain strong especially in light of our low risk business model. Effective this quarter, our capital ratios are calculated in accordance with Basel III capital rules. Additionally, our leverage ratio benefited due to our charter change as the denominator changed from period end total assets to quarterly average assets.","Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we are a bit more asset sensitive as compared to last quarter primarily due to our loan mix trending towards floating rate loans as well as the strong deposit growth that we achieved in the quarter.","Now I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David. During the quarter we received our National Banking Association Charter. We believe this Charter is best aligned to our Commercial Banking model. Additionally, we are pleased to announce the Board voted to raise the dividend to an annual rate of $0.67 per share. This marks the 22nd consecutive year the dividend has been increased, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders through the consistent return of capital.","While the first quarter was an encouraging start to the year, the focus will remain on our most important objective, which is improving profitability. We feel terrific about the progress made in recent years in growing the company and look to build upon this momentum to enhance returns while continuing to successfully position the franchise for the long-term. This concludes our presentation.","Now we would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And the first question in the queue comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Good morning.","Jack Barnes","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe","Couple of questions for you. So first one in terms of the deposit growth, obviously very strong this quarter. You did mention the first and fourth quarters were typically the strongest. When you look at the deposit growth that came in this quarter, is there any let's call it large potential outflows that you would expect going into second quarter?","David Rosato","No. We actually had \u2013 we are really pleased that the growth was really across the footprint in terms of geographies and business lines, really nice growth in both commercial and retail and certainly no type of concentrations or anything that we would expect to be volatile in terms of in and out.","Ken Zerbe","So next quarter we actually could see deposit balances actually be up maybe not as much but up from this level?","David Rosato","Well, we would certainly like to see that. We do have, as we pointed out, first and fourth quarters historically for the company had been stronger so that typically has revolved around things like tax payments in the second quarter and the like. So that's the goal.","Jack Barnes","Yes, the seasonal pattern, Ken, that you saw last year or the year before exclusive of the broker deposits is what we would expect.","Ken Zerbe","Okay, understood. And then just second question on C&I, you mentioned that the strong growth was driven by the mortgage warehouse. Are you expecting C&I balances to actually stay at this level, or warehouse I guess moderates a little bit. Could we actually see C&I \u2013 negative C&I growth next quarter?","Jack Barnes","We don't expect negative C&I growth next quarter. Mortgage warehouse was up and a lot of activity at the end of the year. It has moderated a little bit through the month here but it is holding up pretty nicely. So I think there is just a lot more volume right now in the business given what's gone on in the market and we have also been very successful in supporting a large number of our customers with increases in lines and an opportunity to grow those relationships. So the combination of what is going on in the business and kind of growing the business, if you will, has benefited us.","Ken Zerbe","And have those warehouse balances actually stayed fairly healthy going into this quarter?","Jack Barnes","Yes, they have.","Ken Zerbe","Perfect. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thanks for your question. The next question comes from David Hochstim, Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","David Hochstim","Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wonder could you give us an update on your merchant services joint venture. Is that contributing much to revenues or reducing expenses at this point?","Jack Barnes","I apologize. It is a little hard to hear you. You wanted to know about merchant service joint venture?","David Hochstim","Yes, correct. I wonder if it is making a contribution to revenues yet or reducing expenses in any way.","Jack Barnes","Kind of the combination of both. As we transitioned into the joint venture we did consolidate the back rooms so we moved through that phase early on in the announcement. And on the revenue side we are basically on plan, but very encouraged about the way things are going. We are finding, I think I mentioned this in prior calls and it is continuing, that our customer base is responding very well to the improvement in the technology platform and just the scale and expertise in the business that Vantiv is bringing to the dialogue. So we are winning business. We are finding that the capabilities allow us to move many of our larger commercial customers into the merchant service business. So very nice steady progress so far.","David Hochstim","Okay, thanks. And on the Commercial Banking lending fees, is this a new sustainable rate or was there something unusual in this quarter that caused that to spike up?","Jack Barnes","There was a small increase in prepayment \u2013 commercial prepayment activity in commercial real estate. So we would expect that to moderates as the year unfolds. We are encouraged with the interest rate for the customer, interest rate swap income. That is running higher than our expectations. Again, we would expect it to moderate a bit, but we are encouraged that from the fact that we seem to be gaining deeper penetration across our customer base in that product.","David Hochstim","Okay, thanks. And then just finally \u2013 ","Jack Barnes","I would like to point out because we talked about initiatives of all sizes and the investments we are making strategically. We two years ago, had one person would bring the expertise around swaps into the customers with the relationship managers. We now have three. And much more focused sales and support effort on that and I certainly believe that some of the increase in our revenues is related to bringing better capabilities to the customer.","David Hochstim","Okay, thanks. And then on the charter change, are there other benefits besides the calculation of the capital ratios sort of simpler or less costly oversight compliance expenses, perhaps?","David Rosato","No, not from the Charter change. Regardless of regulators, the calculations are complex and that's enough said about it. But the change in the denominator that I referenced in the script, so that is a one-time change and that is the only change that's from a capital ratio perspective that is specific to the charter change.","David Hochstim","Okay, thank you.","Jack Barnes","Just for clarity again, we have been regulated by the OCC and the Fed since the OTS was dissolved and we went through that change and regulatory framework. So we have been under the same regulatory oversight since that time, which has now got to be four years and if my memory is right. So you won't see any change as David indicated.","David Rosato","And I would just follow that up with, so this is the first quarter that we were not subject to the QTL, or the commercial asset test. So if you look through the financials you will see less leveraging at 12\/31. There was some leveraging of Fed funds purchased offsetting some short-term investments and we were able to take that off the balance sheet. That's in neighborhood of about $500 million. But again, that is now \u2013 that is a one-time change.","David Hochstim","So that is done. So you won't be doing that.","David Rosato","Yes.","David Hochstim","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks for your question. And the next question comes from Casey Haire from Jeffries. Please go ahead.","Casey Haire","Hey, good morning. How are you doing?","Jack Barnes","Good morning, Casey.","David Rosato","Good morning, Casey.","Casey Haire","So just wanted to follow-up on the deposit growth, which obviously pretty good this quarter without the help of brokered deposits. Was wondering, it sounds like it was just green and organic, but did want to check to see if there was any deposit promotions involved, or whether you guys are now incentivizing the workforce to deposit gather?","Jack Barnes","I think the biggest piece of it is our continued focus on deposit gathering and cross-selling and we have, as we've said in the past, changed and strengthened the incentives around deposit gathering across the company. So that has been in place. Was no unusual move this quarter or even last, so those things are taking hold, I would say. And I think that is a big part of the progress we have made. We do have and have had a campaign around CDs across the markets and we have gathered a modest amount of CDs from that campaign I would say kind of in expectations and not a big part of the increase. And we have also \u2013 we always have some type of sales campaign and focus. Right now we are promoting opening of checking accounts and offering customers $100 for that and we have a e-checking campaign that is going out to appeal to folks that are more technology oriented to use a low-cost checking account. So we are always working at that and on both ends I guess, incentives and campaigns, but I think it is more a result of progress that results from that over time.","Casey Haire","Okay, understood. And just following up on that, the branch closures I think you said there was 11 this quarter and there's more on the way. That what I would think would kind of hurt your organic deposit growth. What is the sense there in terms of \u2013 are you able to overcome that, the loss of \u2013 like what are deposit attrition assumptions around the branch closures?","Jack Barnes","Yes. They are actually \u2013 so I think in the script, we had the number of branches over the last four years and we have been working at closing branches within close proximity to other branches for a while now and we have been watching attrition and we watch the traffic pattern of customers. So if you originated your deposit at branch A, but you actually do business and branch A, B and C and what percentage of the deposit base is going where and so we plan out the transitions and communicate with customers very well. And we have experienced very little fallout so far. As we go on through the continued effort to optimize the branches, the question will become at what distances branch to branch does that strain the retention of that customer? So far we are doing very, very well and our assumptions is that and our experience has been that we are retaining in the 80% to 90% range on those deposits.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. And just this last one, you mentioned the snow removal costs. What was that number again as well as the amount of the prepay penalty in commercial fees?","Jack Barnes","Just on the snow removal, we spent a little time on this in the quarter. Interestingly, we spent about the same amount on the snow removal this year, 2015, as we did in the first quarter of 2014 and welcome to the Northeast, I guess. But the reason we mentioned it is because if you compare to the fourth quarter, it is up. But if you compared it to prior winter, it is actually pretty similar despite Boston being as crazy as it was.","David Rosato","So Casey, that occupancy and equipment was up $2.4 million in the quarter and just a little over half of that was snow removal.","Casey Haire","Okay, great.","David Rosato","The prepayment, the commercial prepayment fees that I referenced are in the Commercial Banking lending fee line.","Casey Haire","Right. And what was that amount?","David Rosato","That number was just a little over $2 million.","Casey Haire","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thanks for your question. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert, KBW. Please proceed.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.","Jack Barnes","Good morning, Collyn.","Collyn Gilbert","Not to beat a dead horse on the deposit issue, but I'm sorry if I missed it. Did to say, Dave, what the brokered deposits were this quarter?","David Rosato","They actually fell $4 million, so there was no brokered deposit growth.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And what is the outstanding balance of those now?","David Rosato","It is just about slightly over $2.5 billion.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","It's the volume that we did last year.","Collyn Gilbert","Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. And then just as you guys were talking about, just kind of circling back on the continued branch closures and the way you guys are looking at the overall network, are you able to sort of give us some financial impact as to what some of these initiatives will be as we look out?","David Rosato","We have not done that yet and it ties into the statements that we make about continued ongoing expense management and then this quarter we also mentioned that we are looking at some other real estate expenses for opportunities to consolidate.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Outside of branches? Or you are talking about branch consolidation?","David Rosato","No, that's a reference to outside of branches.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then just, Dave, on your NIM outlook, I know it is unchanged from what guys laid out back in January. But I think that outlook assumed a Fed funds increase mid year, if I am not correct. Can you just kind of update us on your thought on the NIM if we don't \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","David Rosato","Sure. And actually it did not, Collyn.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","When we built our budget, we made the assumption that in 2015 there would only be one Fed tightening of 25 basis points and we made the assumption that that would occur in the middle of the fourth quarter.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay.","David Rosato","So rates today are pretty much where they were at year end when we finalized our budget. Now the reality is they kind of went lower in January, backed up in February and have come halfway down again and we are unchanged from when we built the budget. So that gives us the comfort that our margin guidance should remain intact.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay. And then just kind of overall, Dave, how you are thinking about the balance sheet. Is the objective to try to maintain this, I mean you kind of have hovered in that mid to high single-digit range of NII pickup I guess in like in up 200 scenario? Is that sort of where you want to keep the balance sheet? Are there certain triggers that would cause you to go one way or the other on how you are managing your interest-rate risk?","David Rosato","No. I would say our overall goal is to keep a moderate amount of asset sensitivity and we would define what we have today as a moderate amount. We don't talk much about long-term risk to changes in interest rates, but we are neutral to about the first 150 basis point of rate increases from a mark to market basis. So long-term we are neutral. Short-term we are trying to remain asset sensitive and we are not looking today to drive our asset sensitivity substantially higher.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay. That's great. And then just one final question. Any change in the competitive environment? Are you seeing increased pressure in certain asset classes or certain structures or just a little bit of color there? That would be great. Thanks.","Jack Barnes","Yes. Sure, Collyn. I would say no real change at all. There are some modest changes from different competitors. The biggest thing I guess that comes to my mind is in the commercial real estate we are seeing more competitive pressure that comes from the larger institutional lenders that are doing longer fixed-rate loans than we have an appetite for. So we lose business there competitively. And on a smaller impact dollar wise, we continue to see pressure from smaller banks in certain local markets that are willing, again, to do longer-term fixed-rate deals than we have an appetite for.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That's great. Thank you very much.","Jack Barnes","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Tom Alonso, Macquarie. Please go ahead. Please go ahead Tom Alonso from Macquarie, you are live at call. Please ensure your line is unmuted.","Tom Alonso","Yes. Sorry about that. So just one quick follow-up on the Commercial Banking fees and then one on the swap income. On the Commercial Banking fee, is that $2 million or a little over $2 million in prepays that you referenced earlier, is that the total prepays for the quarter or is that sort of an increase?","David Rosato","No, that is the delta.","Tom Alonso","Okay. So that was up. Okay, okay. And then on the swap income, you noted that rates kind of moved around a little bit during the quarter. Was that part of the driver as well for the increase there, just kind of the volatility we saw this quarter?","David Rosato","I'm not sure, to tell you the truth. I think it has more to do with our commercial RMs being more comfortable introducing our swap experts to their customers. I also think just the lower level of interest rates is prompting more activity customers want to hedge and lock-in lower rates for longer and are willing to embrace interest rate swaps as the mechanism to do that. And that works for us so that we are doing less fixed rate, long-term fixed rate lending in this environment. So it suits our interest rate risk profile that we are trying to maintain.","Tom Alonso","Okay, great. Thanks. And I just \u2013 can you just \u2013 what was the total prepay number then in this quarter in that Commercial Banking line?","David Rosato","We don't \u2013 we haven't been disclosing that number and we are still not going to.","Tom Alonso","Fair enough. Okay. Thanks guys.","David Rosato","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Hersom for closing remarks.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you, again, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in People's United. If you should have additional questions, please feel free to contact me at 203-338-4581. With that have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, Chief Financial Officer; David Rosato, Treasurer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our fourth quarter and full-year results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today. As has become our custom, in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter and full-year results, I will outline our goals for 2014. Last year, we continued to make significant strategic investments in our business in the form of people, products and services. This included bolstering business lines such as wealth management, private banking, Boston and Long Island commercial banking, government banking, mid-corporate banking, international trade finance and customer interest rate swaps.","Over the past 2 years, we have also invested in several other areas as well, such as the acquired Southern New York branches; the Park Avenue branch in Manhattan, New York; and New York Commercial real estate banking, asset-based banking, mortgage warehouse banking and cash management services. In addition, we've made infrastructure investments to keep pace with the heightened regulatory environment in the form of upgraded IT systems. All of these initiatives are designed to better serve our customers who continue to seek out our relationship-based business model built on outstanding customer service.","As further indications of support of our brand's banking, I'd highlight just a couple of examples. In New York, our Park Avenue branch recently eclipsed the $100 million deposit threshold. It's impressive growth as it has only been open since December of 2012. Additionally, the average in-store deposits per branch of our Southern New York franchise is now approximately $12 million, up from $4 million at acquisition. As a result, we have exceeded our breakeven level of deposits per branch a full year ahead of schedule.","With that background in mind, I'd like to review some of our 2013 results. Loans grew 12% as compared to 2012, while deposits grew 4% during the same time period. We grew loans and deposits on a per share basis by 23% and 14%, respectively, over the last year. Still, net interest income declined $40 million or 4% due to 55 basis points of net interest margin compression. The net interest income decline was primarily driven by a lower accretion from the acquired loan portfolio which was only partially offset by healthy new loan growth given the ultra-low-rate interest rate environment.","Non-interest income grew $19 million or 6%, driven by increases in wealth management fees, customer interest rate swaps, gains on loan sales and commercial banking fees, which are primarily prepayment fees. Our expenses increased just 1%, half of which related to increased REO expenses. While we added key customer-facing and revenue-producing talent and covered higher costs of regulatory compliance in the form of both personnel and IT systems, our efficiency ratio increased to 63.7% from 62.3% due to lower net interest income.","Our asset quality continues to be exceptional. Still, operating earnings declined by 5% year-over-year to $241 million due entirely to lower net interest income. Our operating EPS grew 3% to $0.77 as a result of our share repurchase activity.","On Slide 3, we have provided an outline of last year's guidance compared to our actual results. In general, we were in line with our expectations on every item except net interest income. Even though our end-of-period loan growth was within our range of expectations, average loan balances were lower than planned because our growth was weighted more towards the second half of the year. The primary driver of the net interest income shortfall was lower-than-anticipated average loan balances.","On Slide 4, we provide more detail behind the change in net interest income from 2012. Accretion on the acquired loan portfolio fell $80 million. Average acquired loan balances were down $1.1 billion versus 2012 and represented 8% of the average loan portfolio as compared to 14% in 2012.","At the end of 2013, the acquired loan portfolio represented 6% of the total portfolio. The effective yield on the acquired portfolio has been relatively stable in the 6.5% to 7% range over the past 2 years, which is considerably higher than the originated portfolio. Assuming a relatively constant rate of portfolio runoff in 2014, we expect a decline in accretion on the acquired loan portfolios to approximately $30 million or a $50 million improvement when compared to what we experienced in 2013. Borrowing costs increased by $19 million as loan growth outpaced deposit growth.","Net interest income from the originated loan portfolio increased by $37 million as average originated balances increased $3 billion, which more than offset the effects of a decline in yield of approximately 40 basis points on the entire originated portfolio. Similarly, investment income improved by $12 million as a result of a $1.2 billion increase in average securities balances.","Finally, deposit expenses improved $10 million as the 6 basis point decline in average deposit costs more than offset the 3% or $721 million increase in average deposit balances. We saw an improvement in our deposit mix as time deposits ran off and were replaced with lower-cost deposits. Through continued loan growth aided by a further decline in runoffs within the acquired loan portfolio and less net interest margin compression in 2014, we anticipate -- we are anticipating net interest income gains this year as I will outline in a moment.","Slide 5 provides detail behind the change in noninterest expense from 2012. We experienced $17 million of additional cost from the Southern New York branches that we acquired in June of 2012 and the incremental cost associated with our flagship Park Avenue branch in Manhattan, which opened in December of 2012. Direct compliance costs increased $3.5 million, which is mostly attributable to increased compensation expenses within our risk management, audit and treasury groups.","Improved use of technology lowered our expense base by $4.2 million and includes the impact of cost savings and check processing charges and courier fees from the implementation of a new tele-capture system. Compensation and benefits expense improved $1.9 million due to continued efforts to right size our employee base while at the same time, investing in our business. We also realized $1.7 million in savings through branch optimization initiatives. Franchise-wide, we consolidated 13 branches and opened 4. All 4 of our openings were Southern New York in-store branches.","On Slide 6, we outlined our 6 primary goals for 2014. First is to grow loans at a high single-digit to mid-teens rate. Embedded in this expectation is the belief that interest rates appear to have stabilized, which should produce lower prepayments in both the originated and acquired portfolios. The acquired loan portfolio is expected to decline by $600 million in 2014, down from $713 million in 2013.","Second is to increase deposits at a midteens rate, supported by 7% organic growth and supplemented with approximately $2 billion of broker deposits. Third, is to grow net interest income 5% to 8% to the $930 million to $960 million range. Embedded in that forecast is an expectation for a net interest margin in the range of 3.10% to 3.20%. Fourth, is to maintain fee income at its 2013 level despite weaker mortgage banking and prepayment fee revenue.","Wealth management revenue is expected to grow 10% to $56 million. Insurance and cash management revenues are expected to grow 10% to $34 million, and 13% to $23 million, respectively. Gains on residential mortgage sales are expected to fall 45% to $8 million while commercial banking fees, which are primarily prepayment fees, are expected to fall 24% or $7 million. We are encouraged with the growth of our fee income businesses and I would highlight the momentum we have in our wealth management, insurance, cash management and customer interest rate swap businesses.","Fifth, is to hold full year operating expenses relatively flat within a range of $830 million to $840 million. This reflects continued tight expense control, with an expected expense increase of approximately 1%, half of which relates to higher compliance costs. Meanwhile, we are covering the cost of our previously discussed strategic investments in our businesses. Sixth, is to preserve our fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.","Since we set our 55% efficiency ratio target in the second quarter of 2011, 3 major factors have slowed our progress. First and foremost, we've continued to find large investment opportunities, many of which I referenced at the beginning of my comments, that position us for greater earnings power in the future. While this talent is now in place, several of these initiatives are relatively new efforts and as such, continue to ramp up their productivity. Second, we faced a decline in interest rates across the yield curve as well as tighter-than-expected credit spreads.","While we were never betting on big interest rate increases to achieve our efficiency ratio goal, we similarly were not expecting rates to fall as they did, most notably through the period ending June 2013. Finally, there is no question that this is the most challenging and intense regulatory environment we have ever experienced. And while we have been successful in containing compliance-related costs, the world of heightened expectations has added approximately $10 million in direct expenses since 2011 to our annual expense base from both a people and systems perspective.","We have not attempted to capture an aggregate level of incremental compliance costs, but we have instead isolated the direct costs related to risk management, audit and the treasury groups. The latter group leads our stress testing process. The final impact -- the financial impact of the heightened regulatory requirements is being felt across our organization as we keep pace with the necessary investments.","A 55% efficiency ratio remains our aspirational target. However, given our previously discussed initiatives and the current environment, we now anticipate our efficiency ratio will be in the low 60s by the fourth quarter of this year, with additional progress thereafter.","With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. Now, with respect to our fourth quarter results. On Slide 7, operating earnings were $60 million or $0.20 per share while net income was $59.3 million or $0.20 per share. The net interest margin declined by 6 basis points to 3.24% compared to 3.30% in the third quarter. The margin for the year was 3.31%, which is in line with our 2013 guidance range of 3.3% to 3.4%.","End of period loans grew at a 20% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. This marks our 13th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and our customers. Further, our commercial pipelines remained strong and runoff in the acquired portfolio has settled in at a slower rate as we predicted last January.","Efficiency ratio for the quarter increased to 64.3% from 63.6% in the third quarter, primarily due to lower fee income. Asset quality remains strong with net charge-offs of 18 basis points. We firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.9 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $14.72 per share, completing the repurchase program previously authorized by the board.","In 2013, we repurchased 33.4 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $13.74 per share. We captured compelling returns on our 2013 repurchase program with a tangible book value dilution earn-back period of approximately 5.3 years. In addition, the repurchases have positioned us for improvement in our future dividend payout ratio, return on equity metrics and earnings per share. Capital ratios remain solid, especially in light of our relatively low-risk business model and are now close to peer median levels on a tangible equity to tangible asset basis.","On Slide 8, we provide detail behind the change in net interest income on a linked quarter basis. Originated loan growth caused net interest income to increase by $3.4 million. This was offset by a $3.1 million decline in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio. Growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign for the quarters ahead. Higher average securities balances and a lower deposit cost contributed a further $1.3 million to net interest income, which was partially offset by a $200,000 increase in borrowing cost.","On Slide 9, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.24% net interest margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, the third quarter net interest margin was 3.3%. Runoff in the acquired portfolio and new loan volume and mix each impacted our margin by 4 basis points. As we've already discussed, we anticipate the effects of the acquired loan portfolio runoff to continue to decline in the quarters ahead.","Slide 10 provides a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $1.2 billion or 20% annualized. This was achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets and strength in product lineup. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas.","Commercial real estate contributed 46% of total originated loan growth or $595 million. C&I contributed 38% or $488 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across many categories, including equipment finance. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million.","Residential mortgages contributed 15% or $198 million of originated loan growth in the fourth quarter. Annualized residential mortgage growth this quarter was 17%, in line with last quarter's 15% growth rate. The residential mortgage portfolio growth was predominantly due to continued strong originations and a slowdown in prepayments. Approximately 94% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.","New home equity loans contributed $21 million of originated loan growth. It is important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail-originated with 61% in a first lien position. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $137 million this quarter compared to $220 million in the third quarter of 2013 and $396 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. As Jack mentioned earlier, we are anticipating continued slower runoff in all of our loan portfolios, including our acquired loan portfolio, which is expected to help support healthy loan growth in 2014.","As you can see on Slide 11, a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits: retail deposits increased $298 million and commercial deposits increased $69 million, supported by annualized non-interest-bearing and savings deposit growth of 6% and 11%, respectively. We continue to focus on improving the mix of our deposit base. Efforts throughout our franchise to lower deposit cost, particularly in acquired markets, contributed to a further decline in deposit cost of 35 basis points.","The larger deposit opportunities relate to continued improvement in our deposit mix in favor of non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of our retail footprint, especially in our underrepresented markets of greater Boston and Metro New York. Acquired deposits represent 13% of total deposits and weighted average cost of 64 basis points, down 14 basis points or approximately 18% over the last year. We have a number of initiatives underway to further emphasize the importance of deposit gathering as a way to support funding, profitability and customer retention.","On Slide 12, we take a closer look at non-interest income which decreased $3.8 million on a linked quarter basis. Income from customer interest rates swaps and operating leases each added $700,000 to fee income this quarter, while investment management fees and brokerage commissions both contributed $400,000. Gains in residential mortgage loan sales decreased by $2.9 million, driven by a 58% decline in volume, combined with a 50 basis point decline in margin.","Insurance was seasonably weaker, posting a $2.4 million decline from the prior quarter. As a reminder, most of our insurance renewals take place in the first to third quarters. Bank service charges declined $1.5 million from the prior quarter. This decline was spread fairly evenly between ATM convenience, interchange and overdraft fees.","Slide 13, we illustrate the key components of our changes in noninterest expense. We continue to control expenses tightly. As we've discussed, this is even more notable, considering we have invested in revenue-producing initiatives and are covering the higher cost of compliance. From an operating expense perspective, net REO costs were $2.4 million lower, primarily due to a write-down in the third quarter on 1 large single-family residence in Fairfield County.","Advertising and promotion expenses decreased $1 million from the third quarter due to the timing of television commercials. Comp and benefit expenses increased $1 million, primarily due to incentive accruals related to increased loan production.","Expenses associated with operating leases increased $600,000. The net impact was a $1.5 million decrease in operating expenses for the quarter. As a reminder, payroll taxes and 401K matches are typically higher in the first quarter of the year. As a result, expenses are expected to be approximately $4 million higher next quarter.","The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last 5 quarters. As we previously discussed, our efficiency ratio has been impacted by lower interest rates, higher compliance costs, investments and revenue-producing initiatives. All of which mask our tight expense control. We continue to focus on improving operating leverage.","Slide 15 and 16 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated non-performing assets at 1.08% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group in top 50 banks and are down approximately 30% from 1.48% in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Acquired non-performing loans are not included in these calculations due to the different accounting model applicable to such loans. However, it's worth noting that we're very pleased with their performance as we've seen these balances decline $39 million or 22% to $143 million in the current quarter from $182 million a year ago.","Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs continue to remain low at 18 basis points compared to 17 basis points last quarter, and 19 basis points 1 year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge-offs, net charge-offs this quarter were 17 basis points. These levels continue to reflect minimal loss content in our non-performing assets and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 58% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand the credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","Lastly, while our allowance for loan losses appears relatively unchanged on a year-over-year basis, there are 2 important trends I'd like to highlight. First, we continued to improve our originated allowance for loan losses relative to originated nonperformers. This ratio improved to 82% in the fourth quarter from 75% in the third quarter, driven by an approximately 10% decline in nonperformers. In addition, we are provisioning for our loan growth. In 2013, half of our provision was related to loan growth. Lower non-performers, newly originated loan to better risk ratings, our allowance for loan loss methodology requires less provision expense.","Now, I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 17 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compounded annual rates of 23% and 14%, respectively.","Operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 75 basis points compared to 78 basis points for the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra low interest-rate environment and some recent initiatives which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and a continued disciplined approach to expenses.","Slide 19 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity since the fourth quarter of 2012. We expect to see continued progress in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Following the completion of our share repurchase authorization, our capital levels are in line with peers on a tangible common equity, tangible asset basis.","On Slide 20, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain solid with our Tier 1 common at 10.2% and tangible common equity ratio at 7.8%. Again, it is worth noting that we have recalculated our Tier 1 common ratio in prior periods in accordance with the Basel III final rule which was released in July.","We continue to look for ways to best serve our customers and build relationships while maintaining tight expense control and returning capital to shareholders. Our commitment to outstanding customer service, combined with our existing and growing set of capabilities, allows us to attract and retain exceptional talent, all of which provides a sustainable, competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation.","Now, we'll be happy to answer questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll start, looking at the efficiency ratio target going from 55% to low 60s by year-end this year now. So a pretty big shift in only a few quarters. How much of a factor were the investments made in 2013 and do you think you now need higher short-term rates to get there eventually?","Kirk W. Walters","If we look at the shift in the efficiency ratio guidance, I think it's -- and looking at it coming into the low 60s, it really is a reflection on the revenue side and continuing to get the higher average loan balances and continuing to have the strong loan production, the guidance that we have for '14, it looks at the forward yield curves, but that's all that's factored into that guidance.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Kirk, to get to 55%, do you think you need higher short-term rates or can you get there without that?","Kirk W. Walters","I think if we continue to see the metrics that we have in front of us with the stronger -- continued strong loan growths and we continue to build the revenue side, we can get to that number without higher rates. Certainly, higher rates will be helpful but it's more about continuing to get the production out of -- and particularly our lending areas and particularly the newer initiatives that we have been ramping up.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And doing some pretty basic math using your guidance slide here, looks like you're guiding to an efficiency ratio in the 64% to 67% range for 2014. So if you end the year at 65% and you're in the 64%, 67% range for the full year, how do you get to the low '60s by 4Q?","Kirk W. Walters","I think -- and we'll be happy to help anybody in terms of sort of the guidance, but I think -- we believe using the guidance we've given out actually gets you to one in the lower 60s by the fourth quarter.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess my question, I have 2 kind of big picture questions. First, how -- I know you had commented about capital, you're sort of operating now near peer levels. But how should we think about your capital targets as you guys go forward? I mean, you're setting up some pretty aggressive growth goals, I'm just curious to see how much lower you think you can take those capital levels?","Kirk W. Walters","I think now that the repurchases are done and we're down at the current levels of capital, I think they remain approximately where they're at. The ratio that is -- the most challenging ratio for us is total risk-based capital because they do be -- tend to be a generator of 100% risk-weighted assets. And that one, if it does start getting tighter, we can avail ourselves to Tier 2 capital in the form of subordinated debt or some other instruments to continue to augment that.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just how are -- what is your -- as you guys are kind of looking at building out the business this year and next and some of your new investments and guidance and everything. What is your economic outlook? How are you thinking about just the economy in general and where we are in the cycle of rates and risk and all of that?","John P. Barnes","Well, we -- Collyn, this is Jack. Basically, I think our sense right now is that we continue kind of where we've been in this 2% economic growth to something that tends towards 3%. Just like everyone, we are hopeful for improvement and we're a little encouraged by recent signs, but certainly not feeling like we're there. But if you look at how we're growing our businesses, I think it has a lot more right now to do with the people and the talent we have on the ground across our markets and our various business lines and taking market share. If you look at things like our C&I line utilization, they're actually still remaining pretty steady. So it's not showing signs of an improving economy where our commercial customers are going ahead and start using the lines more actively. So we're, I'd say, we're in that range. If you wanted to think of how we think of an economic outlook, it's 2% to 3% growth. We think rates have come up to near 3% on this 10-year rate, and we expect that we'll be in that range and maybe modestly continuing to come up, but certainly no quick movements.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess we shouldn't read into the acceleration of growth at the same time of aggressively lowering capital and aggressively sort of lowering reserves, I guess would indicate that you're very optimistic kind of about the risk profile that you're putting on the balance sheet, but that -- I shouldn't draw that conclusion necessarily, I guess? It's more just a function of what's happening more from a bottoms up standpoint with the people on the ground, as you said?","John P. Barnes","Yes, I'm not quite following you there, but I would -- we are sticking to our discipline in our underwriting across our businesses. We're not in any new businesses. We've expanded our presence in those business lines across our expanded footprint and we've added talent to business lines. But we are fundamentally going at it the same way, I mean our -- the way we approach credit has remained consistent. So I think that addresses part of your question. So we, as Kirk responded in regarding the efficiency ratio, we see continued solid loan growth at the pace that we guided to. And as we -- we definitely feel like we've transitioned, right, from the balanced approach to deploying capital and getting the capital normalized, if you will. Some -- through the last 3 years, right, some acquisitions, a lot of organic growth and the share repurchases have positioned us now to have a more normalized capital level. And now, we're focused on moving forward to continue to improve profitability and grow the business.","Kirk W. Walters","Collyn, I would comment on a -- your comment about \"aggressive\" capital reduction and \"aggressive\" provisioning. I think if you look through, and we gave all this information in our commentary, first, all that's happened on the capital is we've brought it down to normalized levels but still, in many cases, higher capital than our peers. And on the loan loss provisioning, which we covered in our commentary, over half of that provision is for loan growth. The reality is we don't have high charge-offs and the charge-offs we do have, 58% of them we'd already established reserves in prior times. So when they come through, that's because that loan has been resolved. So I would respectfully disagree that we're being aggressive in there. I think we gave a lot of details for people to try to understand how we run that and how we calculate it. And we are benefiting from the fact we've had a long history of excellent credit quality.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes. No, I guess I just meant from a timing perspective, not necessarily of behavior -- but the speed at which this is happening. I understand. I hear you. I understand. And then just one final question, and you guys touched on it. It's just sort of how you are thinking about just the franchise in general, and loan growth is outstripping deposit growth, but it sounds like you have maybe some deposit initiatives underway. And then also just give a little bit of background as to why the option for going after the broker deposit market.","John P. Barnes","Well, so and I think in terms of the franchise and kind of how the loan growth is developing, I think we're on the same page based on where we started. And we do see our loan-to-deposit ratio has come up as that loan growth has outstripped the deposit growth. There's a number of things going on that give us optimism as we move forward, and I'll go back to the New York example of just growing the deposits in those in-stores that we acquired at a much better pace than we had projected originally. And it's the same throughout that actually, that New York market across our traditional and in-store branches. And I mentioned Park Avenue and how well we're doing there. So growing deposits and our deposit base in New York and Boston is a big part of how we bring the funding and the deposits from those areas in line, if you will, with our historic positioning across the rest of the footprints. So we think we're very, very good at retail banking. Our folks are great and they're well trained, and our retail bank will generate deposits. We just happen to have done very well at growing the business, the loan businesses, because of the efforts we've put in there. In the meantime, we recognize that even though historically we've never had broker-type deposits that many of our peers do and it was a lever that we could look to pull. And we did some work on that. And along with some other things that we're looking at on the deposit strategy front and decided that for all the right reasons, it was appropriate to take on some broker deposits.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney Capital.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Just firstly, in terms of C&I loans, you talked about utilization rates remaining, I think, fairly unchanged. And that's consistent with commentary from some other banks as well. The puzzling thing seems to be that despite sort of unchanged utilization rates, there still seems to be healthy growth in C&I loans. So it seems that everyone seems to be borrowing more other than each bank's own customers. And that seems a little bit strange, so I was just wondering if you could provide some color on that given that there's growth in C&I loans, just utilization rates for existing customers remain flat.","John P. Barnes","Yes. So, I mean, I think if -- you have to go back to kind of our positioning and what's happened with us over the last 3 years. We've entered new markets where we -- adjacent to where our core franchise has been, I mean Boston and New York. And we are competing in those markets and winning business. And that is allowing us to grow the portfolio. So in the past, I know I'd mentioned C&I lending in New York, and particularly on Long Island. We built a team out there. They continue to build that portfolio at a very steady pace. So we're winning customers from others in those new markets, and we're doing the same thing in Boston. And we also have had a lot of good solid progress this year in our equipment finance businesses. We've had growth in both of those portfolios. They're both national in nature and long-standing, and we just continue to compete and be successful there. And then ABL is the same. We've had very steady, consistent progress, below the 12%, if I recall, but pretty nice and steady. It's something in that 8% to 10% range. So we're building out our multiple businesses across the franchise and within businesses like equipment finance that we've been in for quite some time and we're making progress.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's a helpful perspective. And then in terms of the payout ratio and your dividends, you provided some commentary, but I just wanted to flesh that out just a little more. Are we basically saying -- are you basically suggesting that in terms of the payout ratio, given that the capital ratios are now kind of more in line with peers, and I would say your payout ratio has been higher than peers up to this point, that we should expect your payout ratio to come down going forward? Or are you saying that it will remain still at relatively stable levels? I just wanted to clarify that a little bit.","John P. Barnes","Sure. So again, I guess I would encourage you to look back, but if you -- as you -- if you look at how we've run the buyback program and seen how the number of shares has come down while at the same time we've improved profitability, the combination of those 2 things has steadily brought the dividend payout ratio over the last several years down from what had been over 100% to, I believe, it's 80-something, at the current quarter end. And as we look forward and we see improvement in profitability with, again, a lower share count, so lower deposit payout, we see steady improvement in that ratio in the near to intermediate horizon.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last question was in terms of deposits, you did talk about the broker deposit market and the fact that you want to raise, I think it was a couple of billion through the broker deposit market. Can you just remind us in terms of online deposits, how much you have and if you plan to expand more within that channel given that, that's where it seems like a lot of folks are focused on these days? So can you give some color on that?","John P. Barnes","We don't have a lot of color there. We don't do a lot of -- we don't go out with a lot of rate and look for online deposits from, say, across the country. I think I'm a little familiar with what others might be doing there. But we -- it's not something that we have actively done and we're not actively pursuing that into this program.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is actually Timur Braziler filling in for Dave. My first question is regarding the accretion runoff. I think you had mentioned it was going to be $30 million in 2014 compared to $80 million this past year. Just the timing on that, is that going to be spread pretty evenly throughout the year or is that going to be mainly front-loaded?","Kirk W. Walters","No, I would say that it's going to be fairly evenly throughout the year. And you can sort of see how the pay downs and such will occur in that acquired portfolio because we've been giving it out there quarterly. And remember, when we say accretion under that accounting model, it includes all income on the loan. So the underlying coupon, as well as any mark on it.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. Okay, great. And looking at the commercial real estate balance, a strong quarter for that, I'm just wondering what portion of the quarterly growth was attributed to the multifamily portfolio?","Kirk W. Walters","If you look at the commercial real estate growth this quarter, about 3\/4 of that was in relation to what we referred to as New York commercial real estate and probably 80% of that number was \"multifamily\".","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then looking into next year, how much of the planned loan growth is going to be attributed to the multifamily space?","Kirk W. Walters","How much -- run that question by me again.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So for the loan growth guidance that you provided for 2014, what portion of that do you think is going to be coming from the multifamily space?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the -- I would say that the -- what we expect in terms of production out of, if you're referring to the New York commercial real estate, because we do multifamily throughout our franchise.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right, the New York space.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. If you're looking at that, it would be very consistent with this year.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then...","Kirk W. Walters","So not [indiscernible] increase it.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm sorry, what was that?","Kirk W. Walters","We're not looking to increase it.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Okay, great. And then looking at the securities portfolio, there was a pretty good growth again in the most recent quarter, and it looks like a lot of that was loaded towards the back end of the quarter. I'm just wondering what type of securities were purchased and what type of yield you received on those?","Kirk W. Walters","So the primary reason that we put on -- we put on mortgage backs and the overall yield on it was right around 2, but the primary reason we did that is we are still a thrift charter and subject to the QTL provision to the thrift charter. And as we have continued to have very good growth in our commercial businesses, which is what our focus is, we needed to increase our mortgage backs in order to stay in compliance with that provision. So that's the primary reason that we put on mortgage backs very late in the quarter as we had more clear vision towards '14, what was going to occur in terms of volumes and also the strong loan growth we had in the fourth quarter. We had to put on some more residential-type assets to stay in compliance of that ratio.","Timur Braziler - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just lastly, I guess a bigger-picture question. Looking again into 2014, is there any planned consolidations or planned branch openings?","Kirk W. Walters","I think we're pretty well in a mode at this point that we are pretty well closing the equivalent number of branches to openings. So it seems to be that we will be closing probably 6 or 7, and we'll be opening 6 or 7, just in the normal process of running the branches. But that vast bulk of the ones we have been opening are in-store branches in the -- predominantly in the Southern New York area.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I know you just mentioned that the security purchases reflected the thrift charter requirements. I remember at one time, you guys were sort of talking about converting to a commercial bank charter. Is that still something that is a consideration?","Kirk W. Walters","It remains under consideration, will be something that we will be pursuing here in a reasonable timeframe.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And with the addition of the $600 million-ish of securities at a 2% yield, I mean I have to think that, that will add more pressure on your margin at least in the first quarter or so. Is it right to think about the -- and I know you've given full year guidance, but is much of that compression going to be front-end loaded because of the security purchases at year-end?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, you've got to remember first, just on a pure day count, the first quarter generally costs us about 5 basis points, just the way the calendar works. But there will be some more margin pressure earlier in the year than later in the year, not only from low [indiscernible] securities purchases, but also just how the loan volumes flow. So I think that's true.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's fair. And then I just wanted to quickly revisit Collyn's question about capital. I know you guys said the total risk-based capital is generally the constraining factor and you've considered some options there, but I'm curious. In the past, I think you all have sort of talked about keeping your TCE around 8%. You're now at or slightly below that level. I'm just curious if you have targets specific to common equity and how comfortable you are -- or how comfortable you are taking that number lower, if there's sort of a floor on where you'd like that to be?","Kirk W. Walters","I think the general guidance we've given in that area is looking at a TCE in a 7.5% to 8% type range. And if you think about sort of optimizing capital, probably at some point, could bring you Tier 1 common more in a 8% to 9% type of range. And then on the risk-based, I think we've generally given ranges of looking at 10.5% to 11.5% on the risk-based.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Because it seems to me that you guys probably dropped below that 7.5% if you get the kind of loan growth you're talking about in pretty short order.","Kirk W. Walters","Based on our overall projections, I would say that we remain very close within that range. As the loan growth occurs, we also see investment securities continuing to come down a little bit as the year goes and we sort of manage that process there. And of course, we're not running any repurchase activities so that will continue to build as well.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is -- no, that's fair about repurchases. Is a charter conversion necessary to bring the securities balances down though? Because I thought that's the reason you took them up, was for the thrift charter?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, as we go through the year and we continue to see good solid production of residential loans and multifamily loans, which all help us with the QTL test, you do have some opportunity to have trade off there between the securities and the loan portfolio.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just to stay in that -- the subject of the securities portfolio, would the year-end '14 balance be up or down versus the $5 billion you ended '13 at?","Kirk W. Walters","I would expect year-end '14 will be down.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then looking at your net interest income sensitivity, as you've been adding longer duration fixed-rate assets and then the prospect of adding some broker deposits gets layered in, how much lower do you think you could see your plus 200 basis point NII sensitivity drift? Did [ph] that 7% now came down a pretty good chunk versus 9 30. How much more of a reduction in that NII sensitivity position should we expect over the next couple of quarters?","Kirk W. Walters","The one thing to understand is obviously, this is a projection. It's a 12-month projection going out. So this projection includes the impact of the mortgage backs that we've put on and other activities that are planned in there. And so the mortgage backs and such that we did put on did impact, and more predominantly impacted if you look in the yield curve twist there, some of the short-end in terms of the rates and them going up 100 basis points.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then the commercial real estate growth during the quarter, what were the origination yields and spreads like, particularly from your New York commercial real estate group and the multifamily focus, how did those compare from 3Q to 4Q yields and spreads?","Kirk W. Walters","Actually, in terms of spreads on the multifamily product quarter-to-quarter, in the case -- what you're referring to, they actually went up quarter-to-quarter.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","By what magnitude?","Kirk W. Walters","It went up about 14 basis points.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then in your mortgage banking business, I think you put up 1 million this quarter and guiding to $8 million for the full year. Were there any adjustments to the fourth quarter mortgage banking line item we should be considering, kind of helps you track back to that $8 million full year run rate?","Kirk W. Walters","The -- I think the guidance that we gave was we expect the mortgage marketing gains to pick up [ph] by 45% to that $8 million number. So if you look at the annual numbers, that's the guidance that we gave out.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. I was just looking at the million this quarter, kind of annualizing that to get to 4, and how are you going to get from 4 to 8?","Kirk W. Walters","The -- if you look overall in terms of this quarter and the activity, we did have some activity this quarter that ended up netting the numbers down in terms of us increasing some of our reserves on repurchases and things of that nature. So I think you really need to look at the third quarter as a much more comparable run rate than what the fourth quarter was.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I'm all set, guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Tom Alonso with Macquarie.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Just one real fast one for a number that I missed earlier. I think you guys noted that you expected the acquired loan book to decline -- I don't -- I think you gave a dollar amount or a percent this year, I just missed that number. Jack, it was in your sort of beginning comments.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. The number that we had in the commentary was that we expected the runoff to be around $600 million this year for '14.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Karti Bhatt","It's Karti Bhatt on for Ken Bruce. I apologize, I got on a little late. So if you already addressed this, but I just wanted to look at the CRE average yields. It looks like they dropped 20, 30 basis points quarter-over-quarter. They've been going down, obviously. I just wanted to get a sense of where you're putting the new yields on right now and where do you see that sort of stabilizing?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I think the one and third to fourth quarter, the drop that we saw there, part of that was in the third quarter, we did have some loans that were on nonaccrual, return to accrual, that actually popped that yield up a little bit. We did to a question earlier, I mean, when we talk about -- we don't give out yields, but when we talk about, as far as the new originations. When we talk about spreads in general, the spreads on the CRE business is running from the lower side on the high-quality multifamily, maybe down in 175 range over similar maturities, and then that probably runs up to 250 depending on the types of CRE.","Karti Bhatt","Got you. Okay. And then also, I guess on the funding side, you guys are ratcheting up the FHLB advances. Obviously, that's a little bit higher cost of funding. I was just wondering sort of can you maybe talk a little bit about how -- why you guys are doing that and where you expect that to get up to?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, we have been increasing our overall borrowings, and that's primarily the result of having very strong loan growth and having good deposit growth, but not at the pace of our loan growth. And so we have funded the differential via borrowings and also the increase in the securities portfolio. Overall duration of the borrowings is a little over a year that we have on the books. And the cost of those is about -- a little over 60 basis points.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit about your loan-loss reserve expectation that's implied in your loan growth targets? I just wanted to get an idea about how low that you're willing to let that reserve-to-loan ratio go given the loan growth expectation that you have.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I think that -- and we gave -- hopefully, you heard my commentary on the allowance for loan losses?","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Yes, I did.","Kirk W. Walters","So that you have a good understanding of it. We're looking at more as to what happened with the flow of loans coming in, all the underlying activities. So if you look at this year, half of our provisioning that we did this year was for loan growth. Every time a loan comes in, we're putting away money for the overall future allowances. And by the same token, a pretty significant part, about 58% of our charge-offs related to loans that we'd set specific reserves on in prior periods. So we have a very detailed process, how we go about this. We have continued to see nonperformers come down fairly significantly, which has impacted all those calculations, and also the new originations coming on are at overall very good risk ratings. And that impacts as well the overall portfolio, and we've had good rating migrations as things have continued to improve. And you need to also remember that the acquired loans have their own mark. So that shouldn't be included. So we haven't put out a specific number on the allowance, but I think we've put out a lot of detail in terms of how we get there and what the coverage is for nonperformers and other things.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","So by doing the math, if it's half of your provisions for the growth, then that implies, I guess, that you're reserving at about a 40 to 50 basis point rate or maybe in that ballpark. Does that mean that -- or even a little bit higher, I guess. Does that mean that the reserve ratio could still go lower and possibly near a 75 basis point range?","Kirk W. Walters","Right. I think the reserve could potentially go lower, sure. I mean, because it's all about the underlying calculations in terms of what are the new loans coming on, what are the risk ratings, what kind of risk migration do we see and the stress factors we put in the portfolio. And the fact that we've continued to have decreases in all the nonperformers and such.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And then secondly, on the QTL requirement in the securities addition, is there likelihood for additional securities purchases to meet the provision or did you pretty much meet it with the fourth quarter additions?","Kirk W. Walters","We think with what we've added in the fourth quarter that we pretty well met it for the year.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. For the full year of '14?","Kirk W. Walters","For the full year of '14.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. All right. And what was the rate and term of the broker deposit put on?","Kirk W. Walters","So far, we've just started putting on broker deposits. But they'll be at -- overnight Fed funds rates less probably -- effective rates, less roughly 2 to 3 basis points.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, the rate in term of the FHLBs that you put on in the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Overall, what we've commented to earlier is that in the term side, if you're looking at just the advances, those are 1.5 year to 2 year advances, and I don't have the ratio right in front of me. We did comment on our overall borrowings portfolio, it's about 1.1 years on average.","Operator","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, Chief Financial Officer; David Rosato, our Treasurer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our third quarter results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to share my views on our current strategic positioning. We are consistent with our conservative approach, building this franchise for the long-term. We are forming new relationships and deepening existing relationships across our geographic footprint while providing our customers with a broad set of solutions to their financial needs. Ultimately, we are shareholders and our choices are designed to maximize shareholder return, not only in the near-term but over the medium and long-term. We feel good about both the progress that we've made and the opportunities for future progress we see ahead. This quarter's results reflect the benefits of investments we've made and continued to make in people, products, services and our expanded geographic footprint.","While the results were solid, given the relatively weak economic environment, we were a bit below our own expectations. We will, of course, be providing more detail in the slides that follow. Generally speaking, we experienced less loan growth than anticipated due to lower mortgage refinancing activity which, in particular, lowered utilization rates and our mortgage warehouse lending business. Excluding the change in mortgage warehouse lending balances, period end loan growth would have been 11% annualized rather than 6%. Still, we know our underlying origination engine is strong as evidenced by a 10% annualized average loan growth during the quarter and 9% average annualized loan growth for the first 9 months of 2013 compared to the prior year.","Now, with respect to our third quarter results, on Slide 2, operating earnings were $60.8 million or $0.20 per share, while net income was $58.5 million or $0.19 per share. The net interest margin declined by 3 basis points to 3.30% compared to 3.33% in the second quarter. The margin for the first 9 months was 3.33%, and we continued to expect our full year margin will be within our guidance range of 3.30% to 3.40%, which we provided in January. End of period loans grew at a 6% annualized rate in the third quarter. This marks our 12th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and our customers. Further, our commercial pipelines remain strong and runoff in the acquired portfolios has settled in at a slower rate as we predicted in January.","The efficiency ratio for the quarter increased to 63.6% from 62.7% in the second quarter, primarily due to marginally higher expenses. We continue to grow both net interest income and fee income while controlling expenses, we anticipate efficiency ratio progress in the quarters ahead. Asset quality remain strong, with net charge-offs of 17 basis points. As mentioned before, we firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow our balance sheet. We continue to optimize capital through share repurchases and dividend payments. We were once again disciplined this past quarter repurchasing 2.1 million shares at a weighted average price of $14.33. During the first 9 months of 2013, we repurchased 24.5 million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $13.39 per share.","We believe we continue to capture compelling returns with these repurchases, with a tangible book value dilution earn back period of approximately 5.7 years for the quarter and 5.0 years during the first 9 months of 2013. In addition, the repurchases have improved our future dividend payout ratio, return on average tangible equity and earnings per share. Capital ratios remain solid, especially in light of our relatively low-risk business model and are now close to peer median levels on tangible equity to tangible asset bases.","With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown on the elements contributing to our 3.30% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, the second quarter net interest margin was 3.33%. New loan volume impacted our margin by 6 basis points. This was offset by a 2 basis-point benefit from one more calendar day in the third quarter, as well as improved deposit rates and mix, which benefited the margin by 1 basis point. In the quarters ahead, we will be working hard to increase the mix of demand deposit accounts to help offset some of the decline in loan yields.","Slide 4 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $361 million, or 6.3% annualized. This was achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint, as well as progress in our heritage markets and strengthened product lineup. We experienced acquired loan runoff at $220 million this quarter compared to $201 million in the second quarter of 2013. The acquired loan portfolio runoff is expected to remain at these lower levels for the balance of the year given our resolution of significant problem assets, continued portfolio seasoning and longer duration on the remaining assets. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $581 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas.","Commercial real estate contributed $464 million of total originated loan growth, including $243 million from New York commercial real estate. The portfolio remains broadly diversified, with most relationships well below $25 million. Despite exhibiting strength across many categories, including asset-based lending and equipment finance, C&I originations declined $120 million. Most of this impact was attributable to mortgage warehouse lending dynamics, particularly lower than expected utilization rates that occurred in conjunction with rising interest rates during the quarter which caused significant contraction in conforming mortgage refinancing activity. Excluding the change in mortgage warehouse lending, C&I would have contributed $155 million of total originated loan growth. And as Jack mentioned earlier, overall loan growth would have been 11% rather than 6%.","Residential mortgages contributed $172 million of originated loan growth in the third quarter. Annualized residential mortgage growth this quarter was 15%, in line with last quarter's 13% growth rate. The residential mortgage portfolio grew because we are adding jumbo arms to the portfolio which reflects a shift in customer preferences toward adjustable-rate products and a rising interest rate environment. Approximately 91% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. New home equity commitments totaled $214 million compared to $225 million in the second quarter of 2013. It's important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail originated, with 62% in a first lien position.","Given the impact of lower mortgage warehouse utilization rates, we feel good about our underlying loan origination engine. You can see on Slide 5 a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Retail deposits decreased by $299 million, which is driven by seasonal weakness as customers tend to spend more during the summer months. Commercial deposits increased $507 million, supported by strong growth in government banking. We continue to focus on improving the mix of our deposit base. Efforts throughout our franchise, lower deposit costs, particularly in acquired markets, contributed to a further decline in overall deposit cost of 36 basis points.","The larger deposit opportunities relate to acquired deposits, continuing to increase our deposit mix in favor of non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of our southern New York branches. Acquired deposits represent 13% of total deposits as weighted average cost of 67 basis points, down 14 basis points or approximately 17% over the past year. We expect the rate, mix of deposits and acquired markets to become more favorable over time as a result of our franchise-wide emphasis on growing demand deposits.","Non-interest income grew 3.2% over the prior year period as business leaders and relationship managers continue to bring our customer focus banking model to our expanded geographic footprint. As mentioned before, we are in the early stages of this process. As shown on Slide 6, on a linked quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $2.1 million. Insurance was seasonally stronger adding $2 million to fee income this quarter. While bank service charges and customer derivative income increased $1.2 million and $800,000, respectively. Gains on acquired loan sales and residential mortgage loan sales decreased by $5.8 million and $300,000, respectively. This quarter, we did not have any gains in sales of acquired loans. These events are discrete and transactional in nature making them very difficult to forecast.","On Slide 7, we illustrate the key components of our changes in noninterest expense. We have invested in our business in order to support revenue growth initiatives, as well as to bolster our operational capabilities and remain ahead of the heightened regulatory requirements. In total, we expect our investments to deliver stronger operating leverage in the quarters ahead. From an operating expense perspective, compensation benefit expenses increased $2.3 million, primarily due to an additional work day in the quarter. Professional and outside services increased $1.1 million, due in part to project-related activities. Net REO costs were higher by $500,000 primarily due to 1 large single family residence in Fairfield County. The net impact was a $3.8 million increase in operating expenses for the quarter. We continue to rationalize our expense base, particularly our branch network. Along those lines, it is worth noting that we closed 7 branches during the third quarter, which represents over $2 million of annual cost savings going forward.","The next slide details our progress on the efficiency ratio since the first quarter 2010. As you can see, we have made significant progress over this time period. Slides 9 and 10 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated non-performing assets at 1.26% of originated loans and REO, remained well below our peer group in top 50 banks and are down from 1.59% in the third quarter of 2012. Acquired non-performing loans are not included in these calculations due to the different accounting model applicable to such loans. However, it is worth noting that we're very pleased with their performance, as we have seen these balances declined $48 million or 24% to $154 million in the current quarter from $202 million a year ago.","Looking at Slide 10, net charge-offs continue to remain low at 17 basis points compared to 19 basis points last quarter and 18 basis points 1 year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge-offs, net charge-offs this quarter was 16 basis points. These levels continue to reflect a minimal loss content in our non-performing assets and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 58% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","Now, I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 11 highlights our ability to grow both sites of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 12%, respectively.","Operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 78 basis points compared to 81 basis points in the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by our larger balance sheet, particularly our investment portfolio. Progress will be driven by loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and a disciplined approach to expenses. As rates begin to return to more historically normal levels, our asset-sensitive balance sheet is expected to positively impact future returns.","Slide 13 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued progress in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our capital levels remain approximately 60 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity to tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers, shows that our return on average tangible equity is 10.5%.","On Slide 14, we see net capital levels at the holding company in the bank remain strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 8.5% and Tier 1 common at 11.4%. It is worth noting that we have recalculated our Tier 1 common ratio in prior periods in accordance with the Basel 3 final rule, which was released in July. We continue to build relationships, increase fee income, and make necessary investments to drive near-term and long-term operating leverage, while returning capital to shareholders. The strength of our platform allows us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage. In addition, we are well-positioned to benefit from increasing interest rates.","This concludes our presentation. Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos, JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to start with the efficiency ratio bouncing around in the 63%, 64% range over the past few quarters. Do you think you're still on track to getting down to near 55% by the end of next year 4Q '14?","John P. Barnes","Hey, Steve, this is Jack. We definitely are still committed to our goal of 55% efficiency ratio. As you know, that's very dependent on the pace at which we increase our revenue generation, along with maintaining our control on expenses. We are in the process right now of going through our planning for next year and reexamining our view on that. And kind of consistent with the last few years and giving some guidance in the first quarter, we'd be prepared to address our view once we get through planning and reexamining the dynamics there.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Jack, the pace of buyback slowed a bit from recent quarters, can you give some color on why the slowdown and do you plan on buying back the remaining almost 9 million authorized shares?","John P. Barnes","Sure, let me take a cut at that, Steve. As we know that we bought in a little over 2 million shares and we are focused on the, amongst other things, there's a variety of things we focus on there, but one is the tangible book value earn-back. And so in terms of the remaining shares, we do expect to buy them in, but the pace is going to be dependent somewhat on stock prices and the market.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And Kirk, just a final one. How you viewing your ability to protect the margin here, that 6 basis point hit in 3Q from new loan yields seems pretty steep?","Kirk W. Walters","That's pretty consistent with what we had put out there in terms of the biggest impact on our margin was going to be our success at originating new loans and we still are originating at a level that is below where the portfolio yield is partially because of the acquired loans in the portfolio. But when we look at the average yield on newly originated loans, linked quarter, second quarter to third, we did see that actually up about 5 or 6 basis points. When I say the portfolio yields still higher predominantly because of the acquired loans.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collyn Gilbert, KBW.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the quick discussion that's Steve just brought up with you guys on the loan yield, what was the origination yield on your CRE loans this quarter?","John P. Barnes","Collyn, we have historically not given a specific number out there in terms of origination of yields on any specific loan categories. But what we do tend to talk about is breadth in terms of the different categories as we think about the spread and the CRE space what we're seeing as spreads probably somewhere in the 2.45 to 2.50 range in terms of overall spreads.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Well, a way to sort of also ask that question, you might have the slide right in front of you, but if that -- so the 6 basis point decline that we saw this quarter from your attribution of the margin from loan yield, what was that in the second quarter? Do you have that handy? If not, I'll go look it up.","John P. Barnes","I believe it was 5 basis points for the quarter.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the residential mortgage side, you had indicated the amount of the origination this quarter that were in arms, but where does the overall portfolio stand? What percent of the overall portfolio now is comprised of arms? Now I'm talking on the resi side.","John P. Barnes","Yes, on to the resi side, virtually our portfolio is hybrid arms. We have very little fixed or anything in there. So that's all we put in and remember, we pretty well -- we're out of the market from 2006 to 2010. And then we started putting some in there. So there's a little bit of tenured product in there, but the vast majority, 90% plus is hybrid arms.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the, could you remind us what the strategy is on the FHLB advances that's been a bucket that's been growing quite a bit in the last year, but I would assume the duration is still pretty short there because I guess it's like 37 basis points. The cost was this quarter. Is that the intention, just sort of keep building that out or maybe just -- what's the strategy there?","John P. Barnes","Generally our strategy on that has been because -- in particular because the cash flow coming off the investment portfolio and such is generally we're 3 months or less on the FHLB advances. If you look at the average duration of all of our borrowings it's probably about 1.5 years, something like that.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then just one last question, how are you guys thinking about maybe where you can take that the fee, to revenue ratio? I mean, you've done a great job of building out your customer list in relationships and moving into new markets and is that a number that you have in mind as to where you think you can take that, just on the normal course of business?","John P. Barnes","Yes, we're -- Collyn, this is Jack. We've been focused on building that ratio up to 30% of revenue on the fee income side and feel very strongly that we can get there. We've had, as I think you've seen, steady improvement there. And it really is kind of across the board in our various fee income businesses. Naturally some better than others. But we watch it carefully and we're working hard to grow that piece and despite the regulatory headwinds. But banks service charges did well, the insurance did well this quarter. But across the board, it really gets to this phrase we use about introducing underrepresented products into our new markets and taking the foundation that we have, the infrastructure we have, around our fee businesses and then introducing them into markets where they -- sales of those products haven't been offered either at all historically or only, for us, only 2 or 3 years. And we continue to build and penetrate markets with all those products.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Casey Haire, Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So, question on the loan growth outlook. It sounds like you've digested this mortgage warehouse and things can resume at a double-digit pace. I'm just curious, how much mortgage warehouse is left? And then also on the acquired runoff, can we expect a step down from this 200 million per quarter runoff that we're seeing currently?","Kirk W. Walters","So let me -- Casey, it's Kirk, let me go to the first one. If you look at our mortgage warehouse portfolio, it's right at $500 million at this point and what we did see was utilization rates go from in the 60s down to about 37%. So I think, if you think about that in light of what people have probably felt in terms of the pipelines on conforming loans and such in the drop there, you think most of it's in there, but could there be a little more in the downside to it, it's certainly possible. In terms of acquired loan runoff, as we go forward here, I would expect that number to continue to come down. And last year, as Jack mentioned, in January, always give guidance. And that was one of the areas that we gave guidance on and we're really right where we expected to be, but that portfolio continues to shrink down and thus, the acquired loan runoff should continue to slow down.","Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. But it sounds like it's gradual, not necessary a cliff in 2014?","Kirk W. Walters","No, no. After the FinFed portfolio pretty well ran off. The remaining in the portfolio is typical bank-like assets. It'll step down but it's not going to drop off the cliff, no.","John P. Barnes","And we moved through a lot of the problems that we were working restlessly[ph] to get out faster which is why the pace early, I think, reflected a strong effort to -- particularly, if you remember, Smithtown, larger loans and they were situations where our workout folks were trying to exit because -- as fast as they could. As Kirk said, we've gotten to more of a mature state where you have typical assets, bank assets, that'll amortize in the more normal level.","Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got you. Okay. And then just one last one on the expense side. The run rates for professional services you mentioned some projects there and the other line was a little high as well. I'm just curious, what is the right run rate there? Was some of that 4 million of nonrecurring expense in the efficiency ratio recon table that you put out, was that where we -- that end up in this quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. If we think about the overall run rate without the nonoperating expenses, we had been closer to about a 205 type of run rate on a quarterly basis. As we mentioned in our commentary, this quarter, we are up a little bit and part of it is was in professional fees, it was in a variety of projects, part of us little bumped as we mentioned in other, which would have been down more, but we took almost a $2 million write-down on a residential property which kept the other expense up. And then a little more comp in Benny [ph] because of an extra day. So it was elevated a bit, we would certainly hope and expect to get it more back toward that 205 number.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Dave Rochester, Deutsche Bank.","Unknown Analyst","It's actually [indiscernible] with Deutsche Bank. First question circles back to the loan yields. I appreciate that you don't provide a specific yield on specific product, but maybe provide the blended origination yield on new production during the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","We don't really put that one out there either. Like I say, when we tend to think about things. We think, as commercial bankers, we think about them in terms of spreads.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. But you said that was higher than the second quarter just from a directional perspective, is that correct?","Kirk W. Walters","That's correct.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then on the arm product that was booked during the quarter, what was the typical duration that clients migrated towards? Was it more 5-year stuff or was it longer?","Kirk W. Walters","I would say it probably average more around 7. More on this 7 ones [ph] on average is where the production came in.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. On the commercial real estate growth, the 300 million plus linked quarter, how much of that was attributed to the multifamily space?","Kirk W. Walters","I think we mentioned in our commentary that those 250 million came out of New York REIT.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, okay. And then going forward for next quarter, should we expect to see similar trends with the majority of the loan growth coming again from the commercial real estate portfolio on the residential portfolio?","John P. Barnes","Well, right now, we certainly do expect on the commercial real estate portfolio that we will see similar activity. And residential was actually very strong this quarter. We definitely saw the consumer look to the arms as the conforming rates and the longer term fixed rates came up. So hard to predict how that will go, but the areas that we're seeing in addition to residential and the commercial real estate particularly this quarter but really through the years been good growth in our ABL group and also equipment-financed units. So I think as Kirk said in the commentary, we're seeing nice diversified contribution, if you will, across the business lines.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then, I guess, my last question just circles back to the buyback. I think I missed in your prepared commentary what the tangible book value earn-back has been year-to-date.","John P. Barnes","5.0, so 5 years.","Unknown Analyst","5 years, okay. And then just going forward, is there a specific target that you have in mind for book valuation[ph]?","Kirk W. Walters","There's not one that we have out there publicly, no.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of David Darst, Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Kirk, would you walk us through the non-performing loan buckets in the acquired portfolios. You had pretty good resolution over the past 6 quarters and it seemed to slow down this quarter. Any timing and what's the opportunity for further cost recovery income?","Kirk W. Walters","Are you looking at the slide, David?","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Correct. I guess you still got 90 million remaining at Smithtown. And the markets are recovering.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. And I think what's happened is, I mean, it has definitely slowed down in terms of the activity there. In the second quarter, we did have some loan sales which you saw the gain on acquired loans, those were all adversely rated credits that we were able to sell out. But it's, I think we're working through it, but we are, at this point, down to a lot smaller pieces and it tends to be a lot lumpier as we're trying to move it out.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And just as you're building out the franchise and you're going to get up market in certain loan categories, are you inclined to go out of market or do any national lending whether it be equipment finance or ABL?","John P. Barnes","Well, David, this is Jack. We do and have historically in the Equipment Finance business, those -- both those businesses are national businesses. PCLC is equipment finance unit that we've operated here at People's for decades and it's been a national business. And it was reacquired FinFed, and that continues to operate again in basically the same business model that they were in when we acquired them.","Kirk W. Walters","I would add to that just as I think we've talked about in the past, there is a portion of the mortgage warehouse business that tends to be out of market as well. But aside from that, the out of market activity we have in any syndicated credits or anything. It's very small and has been something that was historically done just running down.","John P. Barnes","Maybe worth repeating that when we talk about our market, we are talking about Washington, D.C., up through the Northeast corridor. Most of our activity naturally is New York to Boston, if you will. But we certainly operate some of our businesses, commercial real estate group, for instance, in the mid-Atlantic area as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Ramsey, FBR Capital Markets.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I might have missed this in the prepared remarks, but with the mortgage warehouse decline, I know you said it's $500 million today, but what was that down from? How much of that portfolio actually shrinked in the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","The peak of the portfolio was about $760 million. So it's down $260 million.","Unknown Analyst","And how much was it last quarter? What was sort of the quarter change?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, that's what I just said. Last quarter it was $760 million. This quarter, $500 million. So a difference of $260 million.","James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. I'm sorry, I thought you had said the peak. I wasn't sure that was last quarter. And then I'm curious too with that portfolio, what has happened in terms of yield. And even without providing specific numbers around yields, have yields been stable in that business? Have they risen as mortgage rates have risen, have they narrowed from competition?","John P. Barnes","Well, once again, we don't give yields but we give spreads. [indiscernible] that we talk about spreads. And when you look at the spread in that business, we thought compressed a little bit but the spreads are still over 300 basis points.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, that is helpful. And I wanted to ask a question about efficiency too. I know when you talked about Slide 8, you pointed out there has been considerable progress on the efficiency front and there certainly was for 2011. But it seems to have sort of stagnated over the last couple of years. And I'm just curious, in this rate environment, is there opportunity to continue to sort of push it down from the mid-to low 60s?","John P. Barnes","So I think the observation about the last year or so, the primary driver there in having a level off had to do of course with our margin compressing and the contribution for the net interest income piece on the revenue side was coming down, and you can see that in the numbers. So as we've been talking about, as the margin begins to largely stabilize and we continue to grow loans at a good pace, then we would get back to seeing improvement. All else being equal, of course, all else isn't equal. We're continuing to grow our fee businesses at a steady pace. And that -- continuing that pattern will help as well. And of course, controlling expenses. So I think the key answer to your observation is the first one about the margin and the transition from having the margin begin to compress, if you will, and decline and that contribution pull back and now we're building that back as we move forward.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So while I know you guys aren't yet sort of ready to talk about 4Q '14, I guess it's fair to say that with the pace of margin contraction slowing, you would expect the material improvement and efficiency in '14 versus '13?","Kirk W. Walters","Again, think of what I just described and you expect loan growth and a greater contribution, net interest income gross dollar, we would expect steady improvement as we work to manage all of those dynamics.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Matthew Kelley, Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just kind of sticking on the margins, I'm just kind of curious what you believe will be the drivers to kind of achieve the low end of the 330 to 340 margin guidance range looking at the headwind over the next couple of years, the 12 basis points as the benefits of accretively[ph], yield and deals continues to roll down. So what are the binge [ph] offsets to that to kind of stick in that range, the low end of that range?","Kirk W. Walters","Remember, the guidance we gave was just for this year. And we gave guidance where margin for the year of 330 to 340 and we're right within that guidance. So we haven't given any guidance out as we go forward. And we would, once again, re-up our guidance which we've done the last 2 years in January. So, I mean, what are the drivers of our margin? Obviously, one of the negative drivers, which we do give a lot of information around so people can see it, is the acquired loans, the continued runoff in the acquired loans. Offsetting that, of course, is the acquired deposits that we have which are still on the books at a relatively high rate compared to other deposits. We also, because of the -- largely because of the acquisitions. Have little lower non-interest-bearing deposit ratio than others we're working very hard at in terms of getting that back up to level that we think it should be, which will help on the margin. And the other piece is as new originations come on and get, bit by bit, closer to the overall yield on the portfolio without, if you look at it, without the acquired loans, that will be the other driver in it. So...","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the commercial real estate growth in the multifamily, how much of your production is in terms beyond 5 years?","Kirk W. Walters","I don't have that number in front of me, Matt. But I think the -- it's fair to say that the terms, in general, run from 5 to 10, it's very limited what we do with the 10 end but you do see some of that product from time to time. So...","Mark Vassilakis - Moody's Corporation, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the Securities portfolio, you've ended the quarter 4.4 billion, down 5% sequentially. What types of changes in the securities books should we expect for the next couple of quarters?","Kirk W. Walters","Right now, part of our securities portfolio, size and everything, really does come down to -- when we go through our planning and exercises, not only our budgeting for next year, but all of our strategic planning for next couple of years. In our general view in loan growth liquidity, et cetera, and the residual component becomes securities. Right now, we are in a process that we have let those run down some as we've continued to have good loan growth. And I think if we're looking between now and year-end, probably the expectation is we continue to see that run down a bit, simply because we're not reinvesting the proceeds that's coming off that portfolio at this point.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And last question, coming back to the loan and deposit ratio, how high would you be willing to see that go before you start to pay up a little bit more in deposits?","Kirk W. Walters","We certainly know and acknowledge that it's up over 100%, something we are working very hard at internally both in particular in raising commercial deposits and getting our fair share in government banking and different things that we've been focused on. We haven't put a specific number out there but, in all candor, we prefer to not say [ph] get a whole lot above where we are currently at. And really, the call as to when we would want to start paying up a little more and really turn on the retail network, which we know is very good at sales, is going to be one when with a really more of a view toward an interest rate call.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tom Alonso, Macquarie.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Good afternoon. Just wanted a real quick hit on the tax rate it was a little bit lower this quarter, is that a good rate going forward for modeling purposes or should we expect it to bounce back up?","Kirk W. Walters","The tax rate for this quarter was just a hair under 30. But if you look at year-to-date, it was 31.5. And that would be a good number for the balance of the year. This is typically the quarter that we do true-up our tax rate. We had a little more in municipal loans and such than what we had originally factored in, and that was the primary item that impacted it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goulding for any closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you, again, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in People's United.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chelsea and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results are Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, President; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the full year overview on Slide 2. 2018 was another noteworthy year for People's United. We continue to strengthen the profitability of the bank as operating earnings increased 33% to $461.4 million, the highest level in the bank's history. In addition, operating earnings per common share of $1.31 was up $0.27, marking the ninth consecutive annual increase. These strong results generated an operating return on average assets of 1.02% and an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.6%, which increased 21 basis points and 280 basis points, respectively from last year.","In June, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Vend Lease, an equipment finance company established in 1979 that operates primarily in the hospitality industry. The transaction further strengthens our network of specialty finance experts and bolsters our nationwide businesses.","In October, we also successfully closed the acquisition of First Connecticut Bancorp, the holding company for Farmington Bank. The transaction is the classic in-market acquisition of a high-quality franchise that bolsters our well-established presence in Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. The integration is progressing extremely well, the core system conversion will take place later this month and we are on track to realize projected cost saves.","In November, we announced the acquisition of BSB Bancorp, the holding company for Belmont Savings Bank. The transaction will deepen our presence in the Greater Boston area, particularly in the suburbs west of the city, which are attractive banking markets. The addition of Belmont enhances our already robust team of commercial and retail bankers in Boston and complements the strong organic growth we have achieved in the Commonwealth. We are confident the acquisition will close early in the second quarter, pending regulatory and shareholder approvals.","We are pleased with the advancements made in 2018 to strengthen organic growth capabilities and further position the franchise for long-term success. We continue to invest in revenue-producing initiatives and talent, highlighted by the additions of three senior bankers to lead our newly established Franchise Finance, Technology and Not-For-Profit verticals.","During the year, we also continued to improve our digital capabilities and technology infrastructure. Highlights include investing in a digital marketing strategy to engage clients, generate leads and increase sales productivity, engaging with our fintech partners to establish digital origination channels for deposits, consumer and small business lending and wealth management.","Also in 2018, People's United remained steadfast in its community support. Through the bank's two foundations, over $3.8 million was awarded to more than 600 organizations. This commitment is a vital part of our culture and helping communities across our footprint to grow and thrive is good for our business.","Finally, we are pleased People's United was ranked best employer among U.S. banks and as a top company globally on the Forbes 2018 World's Best Employers Global 2000 List. This is a very noteworthy recognition for the bank and a reflection of our guiding principles.","Looking at the full year results in more detail, we're very pleased with our strong financial performance. Total revenues of $1.6 billion increased 10% from 2017, driven by both organic growth and recent acquisitions. This increase reflects improvement in both net interest income and noninterest income. In addition, the performance was highlighted by a 14 basis point expansion in the net interest margin to 3.12%, marking the strongest full year result since 2013.","Total expenses, excluding merger-related costs, finished the year at $985 million, an increase of $55 million or 6% from a year ago. We are pleased with these results given the inclusion of Vend Lease and First Connecticut into the franchise during the year and having Suffolk and LEAF on the books for a full 12 months.","As a result of our revenue growth and well-controlled expenses, we continue to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by a 3 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio year-over-year to 57.4%. This is a particularly strong result as beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the metric includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform, which results in lower FTE adjustments to net interest income. Loan balances at year-end were at $35.2 billion, an increase of $2.7 billion or 8%, driven entirely by the addition of Farmington. Excluding this acquisition, the loan portfolio was essentially unchanged from year-end 2017.","As we discussed on our October call, we did not expect to achieve our 3% to 5% loan growth goal for the year, primarily due to continued headwinds in commercial real estate and the industry-wide slowdown in the home equity market. Our commercial real estate business was specifically impacted by the run-off of the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which totaled $434 million for the year. In addition, other headwinds included heightened competition from both bank and nonbank lenders, lower demand and above-average payouts. However, it is important to note that we did experience strong stand-alone results across many of our businesses that were in line with our expectations for the year. For example, equipment financing grew 11%, driven by impressive LEAF production, with middle-market C&I and asset-based lending achieving growth of 4% and 9%, respectively. These results highlight the importance and impact of our well-diversified portfolio.","Moving on to deposits. Period-end balances finished the year at $36.2 billion, up $3.1 billion or 9% from 2017. This increase was driven by both the Farmington acquisition and organic growth. Excluding Farmington, period-end balances increased $821 million or 2%. Consistent with our strategy of balancing organic growth and thoughtful M&A, we announced today the all-cash acquisition of VAR Technology Finance. Founded in 1990 and headquartered in Mesquite, Texas, VAR, with an exclusive focus on the technology sector, produced approximately $180 million in originations in 2018 and ranked among the top independent privately held equipment finance companies nationwide for new business volume. The transaction has closed and we are transitioning VAR from an origination-for-sale model to an origination-to-hold model.","Similar to our acquisition of Vend Lease, VAR will become a division of LEAF, enabling it to leverage LEAF's technology platform, marketing and leading automation capabilities. The company is a strong cultural fit as VAR and LEAF have shared a business partnership for many years, leading us to have a deep understanding of their operating model and underwriting process. We are excited to welcome VAR and its strong brand and reputation in the technology sector to the People's United family.","Looking ahead to 2019, we expect the year to be similar to 2018 in terms of economic and political uncertainty. In particular, uncertainty around the Federal Reserve monetary policy and the ultimate impact on the yield curve will likely be the prevailing themes for banks this year. However, our long-term approach to managing the business has and will further enable us to move the company forward regardless of these uncertainties. Driven by our commitments to expense management, excellent asset quality and a diversified business mix, we have delivered improved returns even while experiencing subdued loan growth in certain segments. As shareholders and prospective shareholders, you can be assured we will thoughtfully manage through the upcoming year and continue to build a strong banking franchise for the long term.","With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2019 as listed on Slide 3. It is important to note the following goals incorporate a full year of Farmington and Vend Lease results as well as VAR Technology. However, these goals do not include the pending acquisition of Belmont. Once the Belmont transaction is closed, we will update these goals accordingly.","The first goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 3% to 5% on both a period-end and average balances basis. This goal excludes the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode. Period-end balances for this portfolio finished 2018 at $968 million, while the average balance for the full year was approximately $1.2 billion. We expect the runoff in the transactional New York multifamily portfolio to be $400 million to $500 million for the full year.","Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in a 3% to 5% range on both a period-end and average balance basis. The next goal is for net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for the net interest margin to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.25%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption that no increases in fed funds during the year.","We expect noninterest income on an operating basis to grow in the range of 2% to 4% as compared to $376 million in 2018. Operating noninterest expenses, which exclude merger-related costs, are anticipated to be in the range of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion as compared to $985 million in 2018. As a reminder, this range includes a full year of results from Vend Lease, Farmington and VAR Technology. In addition, it assumes an increase of approximately $12 million in expenses as a result of adopting the new lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, which limits the type of lease origination costs eligible for deferral in our equipment financing businesses. Previously, such costs were deferred and recognized as an adjustment of yield over the related lease term.","We also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. In addition, we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 20% to 22%. Finally, we plan to maintain strong capital levels with the expectation that at year-end, holding company common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 10% to 10.5%.","With that, I will pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Our fourth quarter financial performance resulted in a strong finish to the year as evidenced by another quarter of record earnings and operating return on average tangible common equity of 15.5% and a 160 basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio linked-quarter. Operating earnings of $134.2 million increased 18% from the third quarter and benefited from the Farmington Bank acquisition and further net interest margin expansion. The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate.","It's important to note the fourth quarter concluded the following items which were deemed nonoperating: A tax benefit of $9.2 million realized in connection with tax reform, security losses of $10 million pretax or approximately $8 million after-tax incurred in response to the current period tax reform benefit and merger-related expenses of $8 million pretax or approximately $6 million after-tax.","Turning to Slide 5. Net interest income of $332.6 million increased $26.2 million or 9% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $39.5 million of the increase to net interest income and benefited from higher yields on new business as well as the continued upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $2.4 million from higher yields and balances in the securities portfolio. The largest offset to these increases were higher deposit and borrowing costs, which collectively reduced net interest income by $15.7 million.","Net interest margin of 3.17% expanded 2 basis points from the third quarter. As displayed on Slide 6, this expansion was primarily driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 17 basis points as new business yields continue to increase and remain higher than the total portfolio yield. The net interest margin also benefited 1 basis point from higher yields in the securities portfolio. Conversely, higher deposit and borrowing costs lowered the margin by 14 basis points and 2 basis points, respectively, for the quarter. The addition of Farmington unfavorably impacted the net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points.","Looking at loans on Slide 7. Average balances of $35 billion increased by approximately $2.9 billion or 9% compared to the third quarter. This increase was entirely driven by the addition of Farmington. Excluding the acquisition, average loan balances were essentially flat. On a period-end basis, loans ended the quarter at $35.2 billion, an increase of $3 billion or 9% from September 30, driven by both the addition of Farmington and organic growth. Excluding the acquisition, balances increased $276 million or 1%. Organic growth benefited from strong production in equipment finance, ABL as well as our health care and large corporate verticals. These results were partially offset by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances and continued runoff of the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio. Period-end balances in the mortgage warehouse lending portfolio ended the quarter at $802 million, down $80 million, while balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio declined $79 million in the quarter.","Moving to deposits on Slide 8. Average balances of $36 billion increased $2.9 billion or 9% linked-quarter, while period-end balances were also up 9%. These results were driven by both the addition of Farmington and organic growth. Excluding the acquisition, average and period-end balances increased $576 million and $667 million, respectively. It is important to note the quarter-end loan-to-deposit ratio remained at 97% despite Farmington's elevated loan-to-deposit ratio.","While our deposit costs were up 10 basis points for the quarter, we continue to focus on controlling pricing. Our interest-bearing deposit beta is 27% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 37% during the same period. Specifically for the fourth quarter, our interest-bearing deposit beta was 49% compared to 57% in the third quarter while the loan beta was 40%.","Turning to noninterest income on Slide 9. Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled $88.7 million. Late in the quarter, we sold approximately $236 million of securities with an average yield of 1.82%. As I referenced earlier, the $10 million pretax loss as a result of these sales was deemed nonoperating and offset a $9.2 million tax benefit realized in connection with tax reform.","On an operating basis, noninterest income was $98.7 million, up $6.4 million or 7% from the third quarter. These results were primarily driven by an improvement in customer interest rate swap income of $3.5 million, higher bank service charges of $2 million and an increase in commercial lending fees of $1.7 million. The largest offset to these increases was a $3.1 million decrease in insurance revenues.","On Slide 10, noninterest expense of $262.7 million increased $21.4 million or 9% linked-quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were $8 million of merger-related costs with $3.7 million in professional and outside services, $3.5 million in comp and benefits, $600,000 in occupancy and equipment and the remainder in other. In comparison, the third quarter incurred $500,000 of merger-related costs. Excluding merger-related costs, noninterest expenses of $254.7 million increased $13.9 million or 6% linked-quarter. The largest components of this increase were $12.3 million in higher compensation and benefit costs and a $2.4 million increase in occupancy and equipment. The increase in both categories was primarily driven by the addition of Farmington. Overall, Farmington added $14.3 million to operating expenses in the quarter. The largest offset to these increases was a $2.6 million reduction in regulatory assessments, driven entirely by the elimination of the FDIC surcharge.","As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and other employee benefit-related expenses as well as winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","As Jack referenced earlier, we continued to enhance operating leverage as evidenced by improvement in the efficiency ratio as displayed on Slide 11. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 55.1%, an improvement of 160 basis points linked-quarter and 100 basis points from a year ago. We are very pleased with the significant progress we have made and we will continue to seek ways to improve operating leverage.","We remain focused on maintaining excellent asset quality, which is the result of our conservative and well-defined approach to underwriting. As demonstrated on Slide 12, originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 61 basis points was up modestly from a very low level in the third quarter. Net charge-offs of 9 basis points were consistent with the third quarter and continued to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Sustaining excellent asset quality is an important lever in building long-term value. As such, even though the credit environment continues to be benign and has been for an extended period, our risk management process remains extremely diligent across each of our portfolios.","Moving to returns on Slide 13. Return on average assets of 111 basis points increased for the sixth consecutive quarter and improved 15 basis points from a year ago. Return on average tangible common equity of 14.9% increased 40 basis points from the third quarter and 110 basis points year-over-year. On an operating basis for the quarter, return on average assets was 112 basis points while return on average tangible common equity is 15.5%. As we continue to build the earnings power of the company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.","Continuing on to our final slide on Page 14, capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Kenneth Zerbe","Maybe just a good place to start, not to be naive about this, but with VAR Technology Finance, could you just - would you mind giving us an example? What is the type of lending that the technology does that would be considered an equipment finance loan?","John Barnes","Sure. So a lot of what VAR does is finance the purchase of software and some hardware in the reselling market. So there are many companies out there that will sell software for and hardware for the major companies. They want and allow people to get in the middle of those transactions. With companies like ours, we - our IT department would hire or would - excuse me, would buy software through a reseller and what VAR does is they offer financing for that transaction.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got it. So I guess, what is the underlying collateral? Because if, I mean, if something were to happen like - because it doesn't seem - I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but it doesn't seem like the software itself would be a good piece of collateral to support that loan.","John Barnes","Well, the underwriting on those transactions are often done with very high-quality companies, so I'll go back to the example of us. Many of their clients are, in fact, very high-quality customers. And this is a company that's been around for 30 years and it's cycle-tested and it has a great track record.","Kenneth Zerbe","Got you. Understood. Okay. It sounds different from a normal finance loan, which is why I asked but I think that does clarify it quite a bit.","John Barnes","Sure. Yes. Thank you. It is unique. Thank you.","Kenneth Zerbe","Yes. And then just a small question. The - aside from the $9.2 million tax benefit that you mentioned in the quarter, was there any other tax benefits included in that line? I think the net tax rate seems a little bit below ex that item.","David Rosato","It was, Ken. It's just the Qs coming in - I'm sorry, the Ks coming in on a lot of our tax-advantaged items, our low income housing tax credits, et cetera. So we filed taxes in October and the benefit was all in the last quarter of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","Just want to make sure I'm understanding the loan growth guide. So is it the right way to think about it, you strip out the $968 million of multifamily and then draw that down another $450 million say and then the remaining loans of, let's call it, $34.2 billion, you'd grow that 3% to 5%? Is that the right way to think about it?","David Rosato","Yes, that's exactly right.","Casey Haire","Okay. Great. Okay. And then on the NII, I'm sorry if I missed it, but what was the purchase accounting impact in the fourth quarter?","David Rosato","About $3 million, Casey.","Casey Haire","Okay. And was that - was any of that excess accelerated pay down?","David Rosato","No. No.","Casey Haire","Okay. So it was all scheduled accretion?","David Rosato","Correct.","Casey Haire","Okay. Great. And then lastly, just a big picture question. Post the - would love to get some updated thoughts on your home state of Connecticut, how you're feeling about it post-election? Obviously, there's been two actions here with the Belmont Savings Bank as well as VAR Tech. Is this an indication of - that you're not feeling as good about your home state of Connecticut and we should expect more out-of-Connecticut actions?","John Barnes","No, not at all. Clearly, the Farmington deal would demonstrate that we're still interested in Connecticut, but we just had the opportunities that came up from Belmont and, as we said, we certainly want to continue to build out the Greater Boston area and the Massachusetts. And VAR continues to build out our capabilities in the equipment finance there, so all consistent. We're glad to continue and we have that - Connecticut middle market has been one of our best growing portfolios, continue to enjoy those - the strength that comes from Connecticut there and in deposits.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to start on the NIM. So you guys should benefit in the first quarter from the December hike, and that should put you in your range. How do you think about the NIM trending after that, if the Fed does stay on hold?","John Barnes","There's - it's a basis point or two per quarter upward creep, but the NIM is what we're thinking, really driven by new loan business being accretive to overall loan portfolio.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. That's helpful. And then when we look at the new way you're providing the loan guidance, ex the runoff, 2018 is a little noisy with deals closing. What was 2018 organic loan growth on the same basis, excluding the runoff of multi-family organic?","John Barnes","Yes. It was really flat for the year, inclusive of the runoff of multi-family. So if you back that out, it's about 1.5%.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. So what's the road map that gets us from 1.5% to - up 3% to 5% in 2019?","John Barnes","Do you want to walk through, Jeff, some of the kind of expectations in the different businesses and different [spaces] [ph]?","Jeffrey Tengel","Yes. So this is Jeff Tengel. We think we're going to benefit from some of the investments that Jack mentioned earlier. We've done - we've hired some key people in some businesses that really weren't active in 2018 that we expect to get a lot of benefit from in '19, specifically in the Franchise Finance space, the technology vertical and our not-for-profit team. We also have had really strong performance in some of our existing businesses, asset-based lending being one of them, our health care business being another. And so we expect continued strong performance in those businesses as we move through 2019. And then Jack also alluded to just our core middle-market business in Connecticut, and I would include Massachusetts in that as being just really solid, strong performers. So that's really what gives us confidence. When you couple that with the robust growth we've had in our equipment and finance businesses, I think that's what gets us to the 3% to 5%.","John Barnes","Steve, the only other thing I would add is that we had just shy of $250 million contraction at our mortgage warehouse business that we wouldn't expect to repeat to that extent this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo Securities.","Jared Shaw","Maybe just actually following up on Steve's question about the margin, I mean, what would cause us, I guess, then to get to the low end of that, to that guide, the 3.15%, if we're not assuming any other moves? Would it be more potentially on the deposit pressure side or just not seeing that loan mix that you're anticipating when you get that 1 to 2 basis points a quarter of growth?","John Barnes","It would be two things. On the asset side, if - I mean, we've operated this year in an extremely flat yield curve, but the second half of this year was worse - of last year was worse than the first half. So if the yield curve inverts or even farther out the curve inverts or continues to flatten would be number one, and then the other large drivers will be deposit pressure. If the Fed does go on hold, you would expect more rationality in pricing in the CD market amongst commercial banks. And that should - if that doesn't happen, that would add pressure.","Jared Shaw","You mentioned good growth in the large corporate lending side. How much of that was shared national credit? Or was that really self-originated?","John Barnes","It's shared national credit.","Jeffrey Tengel","Yes. Our large corporate business is all - for the most part, shared national credits.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then would you expect to see that grow in 2019? Or are you happy with that as a level here?","Jeffrey Tengel","No. We would expect that to grow. That market is - we don't have as much ability to kind of drive growth because it is not - it's self-originated. We're buying loans unlike the middle market, but we don't see anything on the horizon right now that would suggest it won't grow in 2019.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then I guess my final question is, as you look at Boston and the Belmont acquisition, how do you feel you're positioned after now? Do you feel that you have the mass to really be able to grow organically the way you want to? Or would you look at doing additional acquisitions, sort of Eastern New England, at some point to deepen that?","John Barnes","Yes. Sure. So I'll start with we really are happy with the way that we've been growing organically in the Greater Boston area. And we really brought in a lot of great talent over the last, I don't know, now, 5 or 6 years and through the period. And we've built very strong teams that are long market participants, if you will. So there's a couple of really, really interesting nice things about Belmont for us. On the commercial side, they have a commercial real estate team - lending team that's been in the market for decades and very well known to the market, very well known to our folks. So we think that those people are going to help move our business forward. And on the retail side, kind of interestingly, we've been in like Lexington, Wellesley and towns to the west and had great success. And Belmont is - in Belmont and Cambridge and a few towns where we were wanting to get to. So the combination of the footprint on the Western side of Boston is now going to be very strong. And so we're excited about that. We've spent a lot of time now with the bankers there. Our culture fit is really strong and in good shape. And they have some good commercial deposit-generating efforts that we'll enjoy as well. So really, if you went and looked at the math, you'd see there's some really nice synergies going on there that we're looking forward to enjoy.","Jared Shaw","And in terms of additional M&A down the road, do you think that you're good where you are or that you'd evaluate opportunities?","John Barnes","I think we would love to be opportunistic and continue to move forward in that area. I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS.","Brocker Vandervliet","Just following up on that other question, what would you say you're looking for in terms of the DNA of some of the franchises you're looking at or you have acquired? Is it primarily geographic or product or a bit of both? You seem to be one of the few franchises in the market who's an active buyer right now, and I'm curious what you're looking for.","John Barnes","Sure. So our first preference is for commercial banks that operate in a very similar manner to us, relationship-oriented commercial banks. And we are open-minded to looking at others, but that would be the starting point. We like in-market deals across our footprint, but we are willing to look at adjacent markets as well. But if you look at Suffolk and Farmington and Belmont, we think those are great deals for us that move the company forward and make a lot of sense.","Brocker Vandervliet","And I realized the guide is ex BSB. Is there anything you can say about it specifically with respect to combined pro form margin? Because I believe BSB's NIM is quite a bit below yours.","David Rosato","Sure, Brock. I mean, you can look at their balance sheet and their margin and put the two together, and you'll see some downward pressure on our margin. Over time, we will be working to remix their balance sheet. They have quite a bit more residential mortgages than we do. And we will be remixing that more commercial and less residential over time. So we will - the initial margin dilution over - going forward will be reduced.","Operator","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","I just want to clarify, what exactly is happening with the lease accounting changes? Sorry about that. Is it how we account for the lease amortization expense?","David Rosato","Collyn, it's David. So the new lease accounting is - it basically says that currently, part of the origination cost that we get to defer upfront through FAS 91, certain categories of those expenses are no longer deferrable. So origination expense will go up. That's the $12 million that we called out. It's - what will happen is the - so on that next lease, higher expense to originate but also higher yield over time. So it's really just a time value of money concept, nothing different. If the average lease is four years, for example, across that portfolio, we will earn that $12 million back over - pro rata over the four years. That's the way you should think about it.","Collyn Gilbert","Got it, okay. So nothing is happening to the amortization of expense - lease expense line? It's all happening more on the balance sheet yield?","David Rosato","Yes. Yes. So if you think about it, of the $12 million on - that's an expectation based on the number of leases we might do with this year. It takes the life of the lease to get the full expense back through higher loan yields.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay. All right. And then just some balance sheet question, just so I understand some of the movements that occurred this quarter. So you had a big cash build, kind of what - and I presume that came from deposit growth that's really strong this quarter. So maybe just talk about kind of the deposit movement, how much of that perhaps is seasonal and how should we think about the liquidity build going forward. I mean - yes, I'll stop there.","John Barnes","So just the minor point. If you look at cash and due on the balance sheet, that was just really very end-of-quarter influx of cash and the way - that was excess reserve at the Fed at 12\/31. That's all that really was. That's already normalized. On the deposit side, we had a very good quarter for the deposit growth. The fourth quarter is usually one of our stronger quarters, so no surprise there. And I can't say anything unusual. It was broad-based across money markets, DDA, commercial, retail and government banking. Nothing unusual from a - driving the increase.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then the borrowing, just kind of how you're thinking about the use of borrowings going forward. I know it's been kind of - obviously, we're seeing upticks in the cost there, but just how you're thinking about the borrowing strategy going forward.","John Barnes","Sure. Well, obviously, the better deposit growth is the fewer Fed funds or short-term home loan advances we'll be doing. What I would say is we talked about this for quite a few years now about the growing capabilities of our commercial bank to drive deposit growth, we continue to benefit from that. And as that continues to gain momentum, we will have a lower reliance on borrowings to fund growth. And we - in 2018, we had particularly strong success in our government banking activities, so large wins of large clients. And I think that momentum is going to continue as well.","And then the only other thing, Collyn, I would mention is when we go through these acquisitions, we're thinking a lot about funding and some of the benefits of the deposits that are coming in. And we're thinking a lot about new households. And so as we grow and then we get into - strengthen ourselves in markets, we're certainly turning on the marketing and looking to use some of our new digital marketing and online account opening strength to drive some growth on the retail side. So we're optimistic and certainly working at doing that as well.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay. And then just a housekeeping item. What was the fee impact this quarter from FBNK?","John Barnes","It was about $3 million.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then one last question. Can you just remind us what the historical loss rates have been in your equipment lease businesses now that you've rolled up so many acquisitions within that segment?","John Barnes","Sure. And it's really quite different by portfolio. So starting with our oldest PCLC going back all the way to the financial crisis, the largest on an annual basis loss rate we had was in the low to mid-70s, 70 basis points. The average over the last 10 years has been about 30 basis points. PUEFC, so they've been with us since 2010, the old FinFed, their maximum loss rates we ever saw from them on an annual basis was about 21 or 22 basis points. And their average under our ownership since 2010 has been 5 to 6 basis points. And then lease is a little different animal. It's been with us last time, but the management team has been cycle-testing for a long period of time. They will run loss rates in the low to mid-70s up to just under 1% through the cycle.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And sorry, just one last question. The SNC book, how big is it now? And how big do you intend to grow that?","Jeffrey Tengel","It's about a little over $1 billion, and I would say it's been growing at about 10% a year or so. We would expect that to continue. I would also add, it's a pretty conservative book. It's generally BB-ish in terms of the credit profile, BB-ish or better.","David Rosato","And Collyn, I would just add to that, that our approach to what we call large corporate is, in our opinion, quite a bit different than some other banks that - and what I mean by that is it's predominantly a Northeast-oriented book. It's - there's a long relationship if we have the ability to cross-sell to that customer base. That means - and the group is highly, highly disciplined in cross-selling derivatives, foreign exchange, has a lot of success in getting deposits. And then when I say also Northeast space, we do a lot of bank at work with those organizations. So we get in there and get access to their employee base. So we just don't want to convey or leave the impression it's just purchased asset.","Jeffrey Tengel","We have direct relationships with the management of the company and have a regular calling program with them, and as David suggested, have enjoyed quite a bit of cross-sell success.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Breese","Just to start, I was hoping to get some thoughts or some additional color on the competitive dynamics as it relates to gathering deposits. And I know your earlier commentary, you said that if that Fed does pause, hopefully, there's some lessening there. But have you seen anything change as the Fed has changed its tone at the very least?","John Barnes","Have we seen anything changed since the Fed \"might have gone on hold\" is 30 - in the last 30 days? No. I can't - couldn't say that.","David Rosato","The only thing I would mention is that it does seem like there are a few people in the market with great offerings right now. Maybe there's a pause or a slowdown in that. We've seen some of the competitors that were out there with rates that are advertising other things right now.","John Barnes","Good point.","Matthew Breese","Interesting. Okay. And then going to M&A, should we take your strategy to reduce the size of your transactional New York City multi-family portfolio as an indication towards your appetite to acquire banks having that - in that asset class and in that geography?","John Barnes","Say that, the less - having less or having some?","Matthew Breese","Should we take your strategy of reducing New York City multi-family as an indication of your appetite of buying banks having that asset class and in that geography?","John Barnes","Yes. Well, I would say banks that are heavy in that asset class, if you - I think I got your question. Would we have less appetite for them? I would say yes.","Matthew Breese","Understood. Okay. And then following that M&A question line, I was hoping to just get a little bit more color on the thought process of striking the right balance between EPS growth, tangible book value dilution and creating long-term shareholder value and how you go about a number of deals more recently. A lot of them made sense, small, digestible, lots of cost saves. But how do you strike that balance between growing the bottom line and growing tangible book value?","John Barnes","I mean, I think probably the biggest - we're obviously looking for accretable deals and the strategic assets of the deals like I described the Belmont positives. And we're very attentive to tangible book value earn-back period. And so we look at the deal as a whole with both of those issues fully in sight and look to balance the two. So I think we think of them much more about moving - strengthening the profitability, moving the company, getting the expenses out, taking advantage of that but also being very attentive to what's the impact on tangible book value.","Matthew Breese","Understood. And then my last one is just around the subject of CECL. Is there anything you can provide for in terms of where you stand, what the impacts might be day 1, what that true-up reserve might look like?","David Rosato","Matt, it's David. I would just say we are busy as every other bank is on CECL. From what we hear back from our industry peers as well as our regulators, we're right where we should be and building out our models and starting to run some scenarios and thinking it through. But we're not prepared to start to publicly disclosing what we think the impact would be upon adoption.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dave Bishop with FIG Partners.","David Bishop","A quick question for you. I think you mentioned in the preamble that loan yields benefited from higher new production there. I'm just curious in terms of new loan yields fourth quarter versus third quarter. Maybe just run us through maybe some of the current yields versus prior quarter of new production yields.","John Barnes","Sure. We spent a lot of time looking at the differential between new business and the existing portfolio. And we really saw no change linked quarter of what that differential was. What I would say is the last two quarters have been the highest differential that we've experienced so far in the last three years.","David Bishop","Okay. Then just maybe just a sense of new C&I yield, CRE yield, just curious on what they're coming on the books at.","John Barnes","I'm sorry, you are specifically asking about spreads and which product line?","David Bishop","Commercial and industrial, CRE loans as well.","John Barnes","Yes. Middle-market C&I is - spreads are around 2.5% these days. CRE is a little bit tighter, we see spreads 2% to 2.25%.","David Bishop","Got it. And then just one final question, shifting gears. There was a little bit of an uptick in the commercial real estate nonaccruals there. Just maybe some color in terms of what you're seeing on the credit front as it pertains to nonperforming assets.","John Barnes","Sure. That was just one loan that caused that uptick. Nothing more than that. We get one once in a while, and we'll work through that relatively promptly.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","John Barnes","Thank you. Our 2018 performance was strong, as demonstrated by another year of record earnings and higher returns on both average assets and average tangible common equity. These results benefited from a further net interest margin expansion, improvements in operating leverage and sustained excellent asset quality.","We continued to make important strategic investments across the franchise in both talent and technology while further enhancing profitability. We also strengthened the company by adding Farmington Bank, Vend Lease, VAR Technology to the People's United family and look forward to bringing Belmont Savings on board soon. Looking ahead to 2019, we are excited about realizing on the opportunities across our diverse portfolio of businesses, deepening customer relationships and delivering value to shareholders.","Thank you for your interest in People's United.

Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our second quarter 2016 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide one of this presentation which is posted on our website, peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Turning to the overview on the second quarter on slide two, we are pleased with the Company\u2019s second quarter performance. Net income of $68.5 million or $0.23 per share represents increases in net income of 11% from the prior year quarter and 9% from the first quarter. The results this quarter reflect our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.","Revenues increased 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by improvements in both net interest income and non-interest income, while growth of 1% from the first quarter reflected higher non-interest income. Total expenses increased modestly from a year ago, but declined on a linked quarter basis, as expected. As a result of our revenue growth and the ability to control costs, the efficiency ratio for the quarter is 60.4%, which represents improvement of 120 basis points from the prior year quarter and 230 basis points on a linked quarter basis.","Loan production rebounded in the second quarter as the portfolio experienced annualized growth of more than 7% with particularly strong results in commercial and industrial lending as well as residential mortgage. This marks our 23rd consecutive quarter of loan growth. While deposit balances ended the quarter modestly lower due to seasonal decline in our retail and municipal businesses, franchise-wide cross-sell and commercial deposit gathering assets continued to be successful. Excluding municipal deposits, commercial deposit balances grew more than 16% during the quarter on an annualized basis.","Before passing the call to David to go over the second quarter in more detail, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our announced acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp and Gerstein Fisher, which are two more successful steps in executing our strategy of growing and strengthening People\u2019s United in the New York metro area.","The acquisition of Suffolk is an excellent strategic and cultural fit and complements our previous acquisitions and organic growth in the market. Their impressive Long Island footprint, particularly on the Island\u2019s eastern end where we currently do not have a presence, further bolsters our franchise in its very attractive banking market. Suffolk provides proven loan origination capabilities as well as a unique low cost core deposit base which very few banks poses. The transaction offers revenue synergies that present the substantial upside opportunities, which were not modeled into the economics of the deal.","We are excited about both extending our full suite of products and services, and utilizing our larger balance sheet to provide more comprehensive solutions to Suffolk\u2019s customer base. Compelling cost savings also exist as we have identified achievable reductions that amount 15% [ph] of Suffolk standalone expense. Further, our complementary business models, shared commitment to relationship banking, and conservative risk management philosophies will ease the integration and deliver value to both customers and shareholders.","And the week since the acquisition announcement, we have started integration activities and spent more time with the Suffolk team. As a result, we feel even better about the consideration given and the expected benefits of this transaction.","Following our acquisitions of the Bank of Smithtown in 2010 and 57 branches from RBS Citizens in 2012, People\u2019s United has been well-received in the New York metro market. Since the end of the first quarter of 2010, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan and deposit growth of 35% and 28%, respectively. Today we have $4.9 billion of loans in New York and $3.5 billion of deposits. All of this progress gives us confidence in our ability to successfully build upon the additional presence the Suffolk transaction provides us in the New York metro market.","Today\u2019s announcement of an all cash transaction for Gerstein Fisher of $3 billion investment management firm is our most significant wealth management acquisition to-date and is expected to bring our total assets under administration to nearly $20 billion of which $8 billion is under discretionary management. The firm\u2019s well-known quantitative investment approach and scalable technology platform will complement our excellent range of investment solutions as well as enhance our brand in the wealth management marketplace. Gerstein Fisher\u2019s strong track record of growth and presence in New York will enable us to leverage our banking products and services with their clients. This transaction complements recent investments in our fee-based business and will further diversify revenues with additional non-interest income.","An exciting and invaluable aspect of each transaction is that the accomplished leaders of these firms will join People\u2019s United in critical leadership roles. Howard Bluver, Suffolk\u2019s President and CEO will assume the role of New York Market President of People\u2019s United. Howard\u2019s deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy and proven track record for growth will further our momentum in this important market.","Gregg Fisher, Gerstein Fisher\u2019s founder and CIO will join People\u2019s United as Head of Quantitative Research and Portfolio Strategy. Gregg\u2019s highly respected expertise in the invest management as well as his commitment to innovation and research will strengthen our wealth management capabilities, enabling us to further deepen existing client relationships and forge new ones.","With that I\u2019ll pass it to David.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack.","Turning to slide three, you can see net interest income was flat with the first quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from ongoing loan growth. This benefit to net interest income was offset by a $1.1 million decline in accretion from runoff in the acquired portfolio, as well as $400,000 in higher borrowing costs.","On slide four, net interest margin of 2.79 was 4 basis points lower than the first quarter. New loan volumes negatively impacted margins by 3 basis points, as new business yields were lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield reduced the margin by 1 basis point.","Moving to slide five, the loan portfolio grew $527 million or 7% annualized from the first quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $600 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $413 million from the first quarter, driven primarily by $372 million of C&I growth. Equipment financing and commercial real estate contributed growth of $30 million and $11 million respectively. Within C&I, we experienced strength across several categories including middle market C&I, asset-based lending and most notably, in mortgage warehouse lending. The end of period balance for mortgage warehouse reached $1.2 billion, up $217 million from March 31st. Retail contributed a $187 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by continued strong residential mortgage growth of $199 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio.","As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $73 million this quarter, the largest amount since the first quarter of 2015 and it was primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter-end was $692 million.","Slide six shows the change in deposits by segment from the first quarter. Commercial balances continued to benefit from franchise-wide deposit gathering efforts and grew $102 million or 4% annualized. Retail balances in line with historical second quarter trends declined $208 million or 4% annualized. As a result, total deposits declined $106 million or 1% on an annualized basis. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business negatively impacted quarter-end deposits by $200 million. Excluding municipals, total deposits experienced annualized growth in the second quarter of 1% while commercial deposits grew more than 16% annualized. We expect municipal balances to rebound in the third quarter, in line with historical seasonal trend. It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits remained at 35 basis points for the third consecutive quarter.","On slide seven we look at non-interest income, which increased $3.1 million or 4% compared to the first quarter. Higher non-interest income benefited from several categories including increases of $1.1 million in commercial bank lending fees, $1 million in bank owned life insurance, and $900,000 in bank service charges. The $1.5 million increase in other was primarily driven by the gain on the sale of an interest in a real estate investment. The primary offset to these increases was $2.3 million decrease in insurance revenues, largely due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.","On slide eight, we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Total expenses of $213 million decreased 2% from the first quarter. As expected, compensation and benefits decrease $2.7 million, resulting from lower payroll related and benefit costs, which are traditionally higher in the first quarter. In addition, professional and outside service costs were $1 million lower in the quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was $1.2 million in higher regulatory assessments. As you will recall, the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015 benefited from credits received for overpayment of FDIC assessments made in prior quarters.","As we continue to optimize our branch delivery channel, we closed six branches during the quarter. From the beginning of 2011, we have closed 61 branches of which the majority were traditional branches. During the same timeframe, we have opened 26 branches, most of which are more cost efficient in store locations.","On slide nine, you can see our efficiency ratio in the second quarter of 60.4% improved 230 basis points from the first quarter and 120 basis points from a year ago. As Jack referenced earlier, this result demonstrates our continued focus on improving operating leverage through ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management.","Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from recent quarters.","Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets. Our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy remains a hallmark of People\u2019s United. We continue to build the business for the long term and will not sacrifice credit quality to achieve growth.","As shown on slide 11, return on average assets increased five basis points on a linked quarter basis points and three basis points from the prior year quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the low interest environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 10.1% for the second quarter, an increase from 9.4% in the first quarter and 9.5% in the prior year quarter.","Turning to slide 12, capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional risk management. As previously discussed, we plan on issuing 200 to 250 million of preferreds this year, enabling a more optimal capital structure and enhancing our already strong capital position. While all of our regulatory ratios are well above internal long-term operating targets, this issuance will further bolster ratios in the range of 60 to 80 basis points and support continued growth.","On slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well-positioned for an eventual increase in interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate shock as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans.","At quarter end, over 43% of the loan portfolio was either one-month labor or prime-based compared to 42% at March 31st and 41% a year ago. So, same lower long-term rates remain a headwind for our risk positioning as evidenced by our long and down scenario on this slide. Therefore, we have begun to reinvest monthly security portfolio cash flows into treasury and municipal securities rather than mortgage backed securities to mitigate prepayment risks to lower rate. This is a modest change in portfolio strategy but one that will decrease downside risk if rates were to again move lower.","Before passing the call back to Jack to wrap up, I want to draw your attention to slide 14, as we have provided an update to the full year 2016 goals we outlined in January. We have lowered our loan growth range from 6% to 8% to a range of 4% to 6%. Subsequent to announcing the original goal, we decided to reduce the transactional portion of our New York multifamily portfolio to focus our resources on full service relationships. This approach is consistent with other geographic markets of our commercial real estate business. During this transition, the legacy New York multifamily portfolio has run off at a faster rate than new business has been originated. However, as mentioned on our call in April, new leadership and talent has been added to our New York group [ph] and we are excited about their abilities to further expand and strengthen our lending activities in the greater New York metro markets. It is important to know, excluding the New York multifamily business, the rest of our loan portfolio is performing in line with our original goals.","The next goal we are updating is net interest income. In addition to our revised loan growth goal, current interest rates along with ongoing global economic uncertainties impacting rates are different than what was expected six months ago. As such, we have lowered the net interest income growth range from 7% to 9% to a range of 5% to 7%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.75 to 2.85; this is lower than the original range of 2.85 to 2.95, which included an assumption of 125 basis-point interest rate increase in mid-2016 and a steeper yield curve. This updated net interest margin range is derived from many different factors. Two of the most significant are an assumption of no Fed interest rate increases during 2016 and a continuation of the current flat yield curve environment.","We are also lowering our total expense range of $865 million to $885 million to a range of $860 million to $870 million, which excludes any merger related costs associated with recently announced acquisitions. As a result of our continued execution of strong cost controls, we have effectively managed expenses while continuing to make investments in revenue producing initiatives in the franchise. The net effect of these changes does not impact our original full-year expectations with respect to earnings.","Finally, it is important to note that full-year goals for deposit growth, non-interest income, credit and capital are unchanged.","With that, I\u2019d like to pass it back to Jack for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David. The ability to consistently return capital to our shareholders is a key part of our business model and illustrates the success we have had in maintaining asset quality while growing the balance sheet. We have demonstrated this commitment by increasing our annual dividend for 23 consecutive years. The Board and management understand the importance of the dividend and the significant impact it has on the valuation of the Company\u2019s shares.","As a result, one of our most important objectives is protecting the dividend as the Company grows in size. Therefore, it is important for both current and prospective shareholders to know, we will not move the Company past the $50 billion asset threshold without knowing we have regulatory support for our dividend. As such, we will continue to reduce our dividend payout ratio by growing earnings and working with our regulators as we thoughtfully grow the franchise.","While the Suffolk acquisition is strategically important transaction, it is relatively small at 5% of our asset size. Since integration is a core competency of People\u2019s United, this transaction does not preclude us from exploring other acquisitions. With pro forma assets of $42 billion, we\u2019re mindful of the $50 billion asset threshold and the potential implications of crossing it. However, we will continue to be opportunistic in regards to acquisition including those that would take us over the $50 billion level. We will only execute a larger transaction that would allow us to preserve our dividend.","As we have discussed in the past, we have been building our readiness to cross the $50 billion threshold for the past couple of years through an internal project known as B50B. [Ph] The project involves a formation of a cross-functional readiness review teams that have completed GAAP analysis on each of the requirements that will be imposed on us when crossing 50 billion. Accordingly, based on these analyses, we continue to build out modeling, data management and staff capabilities. In recent years, we have already made investments to enhance our corporate infrastructure in areas such as enterprise risk management, model development and validation, internal audit, compliance, operational risks, and BSA\/AML. Our goal is to complete this process internally over the next few years and avoid unusual onetime costs.","In closing, the Company has had a very solid quarter as we continue to successfully execute in the marketplace to find solutions and value for our customers as well as build the franchise for the long term.","This concludes our presentation. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Maybe I will start on the loan growth guide, Dave. I appreciate that multifamily has gotten very competitive and as always been transactional in nature. But obviously, there is a lot of regulatory scrutiny there. I was wondering if that had any impact or any pressure from regulators to slow down multifamily, given that you guys are -- that\u2019s been a big grower for you and you are around that 300% ratio?","Jack Barnes","So, Casey, this is Jack. No, there wasn\u2019t any regulatory pressure. As you might recall, really back in second half of 2014, we made the market aware that we were starting to pull back on our expectations for production in this particular segment as the spreads were getting thinner and thinner and the terms and conditions were being pushed in the market. So, we really began slowing down production and gradually pulling away from it at that time. So, when we got to late last year, we made a decision because the production was really low enough that we actually shutdown the unit and began in the new folks that we\u2019ve been describing to build our relationship base model back out.","Casey Haire","Switching to the fee guide, unchanged; it would imply a pretty steep ramp in the back half of \u201816. Just what are the drivers there? And does that include the Gerstein Fisher deal, which closes in the fourth quarter; does this include that contribution?","David Rosato","Hi, Casey; it\u2019s David. No, it is completely exclusive of Gerstein Fisher. The second half of the year for us for fee income tends to be fairly strong. The insurance business will rebound. The cash management, wealth management usually are stronger in the back half as well. And we\u2019ve had I would say really good experience with bank service charges, especially in the second quarter; they performed a little better than we were expecting. So, bank service charges, cash management, insurance, and then as our loan volumes pick up you will see commercial origination fees as well as our swap business come back. So, we feel fairly confident on the back half of the year around fees.","Casey Haire","And that\u2019s versus -- that flat expectation is versus a 342.2 number in \u201815?","David Rosato","Yes, that is correct.","Casey Haire","Just last one from me on the capital front. You guys are looking at that 250 million preferred issuance. I know you guys managed to that 7 to 7.2 TCE ratio, which the preferred issuance really won\u2019t help. So, what capital ratio; is it total capital Tier 1 leverage, which one are you guys after the TCE ratio most focused on?","David Rosato","I would say, we\u2019re obviously focused on all of our capital ratios. I would say the one that tends to be the tightest for us periodically is total risk based capital. It\u2019s a function mostly of the nature of our balance sheet. We originate a lot of 100% risk-weighted assets within our commercial businesses. And we\u2019ve gotten the tightest to that one periodically. The last capital transaction we did was 400 million of subordinated debt at the bank a year and a half ago or so, and that\u2019s what drove that transaction. The preferred, not only will it help Tier 1, but it\u2019ll also help total risk-based capital.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Just a question on expenses, I think I heard you mention the 860 to 870 new expense guide does not include any merger cost. Could you quantify what merger expenses that you do expect from the deals and the timing of those?","David Rosato","We\u2019re not ready to quantify them, Ken. We would expect to see a little bit in the third and fourth quarter as some builds start to come in. But it\u2019s not going to be anything largely material. And we will call those out as non-operating.","Ken Zerbe","And then, just a quick question on the CRE balances. If I heard you right, you are building out a team to kind of ramp that up again. But, just given some of the debate in the industry about whether now is the right time to close CRE or not are you seeing enough positive things in CRE that you are willing to continue to grow or to ramp up CRE in New York? I am not sure that other banks are -- some of the banks at least are not as optimistic about the current environment for CRE?","Jack Barnes","So, Ken, this is Jack. I would say, first of all, CRE is our most significant portfolio and a very big business for us. And we have a lot of long-term relationships that we value very much. As you probably realize, our concentration level is below 300. The other thing that is probably less apparent is that we have elevated and enhanced our risk management process around CRE over the last number of years and have really been operating with enhanced due diligence processes well-established and in our run rate around the portfolio. So, we feel very confident about moving forward in commercial real estate lending and going above the 300 level. And we have demonstrated our ability to manage that risk. Given the diversification of our business lines and the portfolios, I don\u2019t expect that will go too far above the 300 level in the immediate -- intermediate I guess, I\u2019d say future. But it wouldn\u2019t be a concern for us to go above 300. And we like the balance and diversification. So, we will continue to move everything forward.","I really am very optimistic about the talent and the folks that we brought into New York and we are looking forward. They have got a nice full pipeline and they have got some great relationships and we expect to do some great business there and build that out. We are by the way -- just to add one thing -- sorry to cut you off, but the -- in Long Island, we\u2019ve really had a great success over the last four, five years. And as you know Suffolk has a lot of nice long term customers. So, we are looking forward to all of that coming together.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey","Could you maybe touch on the Gerstein Fisher acquisition and maybe how we should be thinking about annual revenues and expenses from that business?","David Rosato","Sure Bob, it\u2019s David. So, just to reiterate a little bit in the press release and what we said, an all cash transactions modestly accretive to 2017 earnings, an IR are over 15%. And they\u2019re, as Jack outline, just a very nice fit with us and a very well run business. They have annual revenues of a little over $17 million. That\u2019s about all we\u2019re going to disclose at this point in time.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. Nothing on the expense side you can help us with?","David Rosato","No. And then, this will not have much of an impact in 2016. It should close in the middle or so of the fourth quarter is our expectation. But, we will include it in January when we talk about 2017.","Bob Ramsey","And I know you will talk about the preferred you plan to issue. What is the timeline; is that likely to be a fourth quarter event; could it be sooner or how are you thinking about it?","David Rosato","We, as in my prepared comments, we just said in the back half of this year. It\u2019s subject to market conditions with lower rates and spreads tightening that certainly the waiting that -- or the waiting seems to be paying off in the near term, but we\u2019re not going to provide anymore guidance other than the back half of this year, at this time.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And then, I guess final question, I know you talked about how you guys are thinking about the dividend as you work towards getting to 50 billion and you\u2019ve still got some runway there. But, does that mean that we should not anticipate dividend increases between now and that point? And when you do get right across the 50 billion, if you are not able to get sort of an all clear signal from regulators, does that mean you just sort of sit tight and wait until you can or how do you plan to sort of manage that process?","Jack Barnes","Hi, this is Jack. So, I am going to start with the comment that you made is as you point out, we expect it will take us sometime to get there. And, I think that\u2019s important as the market begins to focus on the implications of our crossing 50, both with dividend and with expenses. And so, we are trying to clarify our view on that. But, to your point, this isn\u2019t going to happen tomorrow. But, I\u2019d say a couple of things. If you -- first of all, we\u2019re very committed to our dividend as stated. We continue and have continued to increase our dividend a penny a year. And we continue to -- that is our approach with the dividend. And the Board and the management is very committed to staying on that path. If you look at our history, we\u2019ve steadily brought the dividend payout ratio down by improving earnings. We\u2019re continuing to build our plans around that and we\u2019re making steady progress and we\u2019re going to continue to make steady progress as we move through moving from 40 billion to 50 billion. And we strongly believe that with the actions we\u2019re taking, we will continue to improve profitability. And, we\u2019ve tried to clarify our efforts around being prepared on 50 billion on many fronts. We\u2019ve talked to our regulators about this issue and have very good lines of communication. I\u2019d also point everybody to what\u2019s happening through the CCAR process, right. Many, many peoples\u2019 dividend payout ratios are coming up; I think the high mark this time around is 40% payout. We know there is discussion about deals out there that might be approved at 50. So, as we continue to bring our payout ratio down over time and the environment changes, we feel that we will successfully navigate from where we are today to $50 billion mark and continue to maintain our dividend performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O\u2019Neill.","Mark Fitzgibbon","Jack, just a follow-up on the prior question, I guess I am curious why manage the Company around the dividend payout ratio, given that it\u2019s so much higher than your peers? Doesn\u2019t that kind of tie your hands on a variety of strategic decisions as you move forward? Why not just to adjust the dividend payout ratio now and then you\u2019d have more flexibility from a strategic standpoint?","Jack Barnes","We have, again, for years, we\u2019ve run the Company with very much focused on producing very high quality earnings and consistent performance over time. So, I referenced the consistent asset quality while we\u2019ve grown the balance sheet. And because of the ability to produce that we\u2019ve then committed to a strong dividend payout. And we\u2019ve also been very focused on reducing that payout as we move from $20 billion bank to a $40 billion bank. We\u2019ve consistently been focused on improving earnings and profitability and reducing that payout ratio.","And we think that that\u2019s what our shareholders appreciate and that again our price on the shares reflects that appreciation, and we\u2019re very committed to it. We don\u2019t think it really -- I don\u2019t think, Mark that it really has limited strategically. And I understand the questions about what might happen at 50, but again we\u2019re at 40; we\u2019ve gotten support for this level; we clearly are strongly confident in our ability to close Suffolk, and we\u2019re going to continue on the path we\u2019re on.","Mark Fitzgibbon","And then, I was curious, you guys had really good C&I growth this quarter. I wondered if you could share with us whether that was in any particular part of your franchise or focused on any particular industry.","Jack Barnes","Well, it was -- the really encouraging thing about it is that it was really across the different business lines and portfolios. I know, David called out in the section about that mortgage warehouse particularly had a very strong quarter and really that team has not only had a strong quarter but they\u2019ve had a strong couple of years. And some of it\u2019s the market, but I would really say that most of it is their relationships and their knowledge and understanding of the business that they\u2019ve built over time. So that is a constant pleasure and a source of pride for us. And if you look across equipment finance, the middle markets, even business banking, we had some very modest but a lot of progress on almost every front. So, it\u2019s very encouraging.","Mark Fitzgibbon","And lastly, I wondered, was there a BOLI [ph] gain this this quarter?","David Rosato","There was a BOLI [ph] debt benefit received of about $900,000.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","Just a question around your expense guidance. What is it? And necessarily this year but just kind of over next year and as that franchise grows, where do you see the greatest opportunity to really lower expenses? I know you guys talked about how you\u2019re closing branches and reopening more efficient branches. I mean, is that the primary area? I am just trying to understand how and where kind of that maybe expense reduction or expense control is going come?","David Rosato","Hi Collyn, it\u2019s David. You are defiantly right, we are with some of the branches that we closed we have seen some of the constant retail as well as some of the occupancies expenses come down. It\u2019s more for us than just closing branches within retail, there is also technology rollout that are both enhancing customer experience but allowing us to reduce FTEs as well. So that has definitely over the last couple of years been a key component of expense control. But it\u2019s -- for us, it\u2019s really much broader than that. Everyone on the call has heard us talk about our earmark [ph] process and how we approach expense management. And I -- from my perspective, the too much of effect of years of thinking and actively managing expenses is starting -- not starting to payoff, it continues to payoff. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. It just several years ago, back in 2011, we made a conscious decision to have a few members of the management team highly focused on expenses on a very active weekly basis and reviewing everything that we spent as a Company, both tactically and strategically. And that effort is still in place and it\u2019s ingrained into the Company now. And that\u2019s what it is. It\u2019s really that simple.","Collyn Gilbert","And then, Jack, just back to your comment on that you would look to seek regulatory support to continue to pay the dividend, if you were to cross the $50 billion threshold. How do you ensure that? Is that just through the dialogue that you maintain again with the regulators or do you -- are you going to run your own sort of capital stress testing and provide them with the capital plan ahead of that $50 billion threshold? I guess how do you know that you will be okay with your dividend policy once you cross $50 billion?","Jack Barnes","Well, I cannot ensure that. And I think everybody understands that. But, yes, I do expect it. We have very good communication with our regulators. And we also deliver our three-year plan every year and we talk about where we\u2019re headed and we follow that plan. And we\u2019re moving ourselves forward very consistent with what we dialogue about, and they appreciate that. And we\u2019ve made, as I\u2019ve pointed out, consistent progress over time with the payout ratio and we\u2019re going to keep improving it. And so, we expect when we get to that point -- we have been getting support right to this point, we expect to have continued support. And as we move from 40 to 50, we\u2019ll see where the payout ratio is and we\u2019ll see what the regulatory attitude towards the payout ratio. And, we\u2019re -- cash versus repurchase programs are et cetera, right? There is many people that are paying -- have total payout that are 100%. So, that\u2019s where our confidence in being able to navigate from where we are today to that point and successfully continue our dividend approach.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Breese","Just on the margin, the guidance was lower obviously but just thinking about that longer term, if the shape of the yield curve remains flat and the Fed remains on hold, could we see that pace of margin compression continue into 2017?","David Rosato","I wouldn\u2019t trend it out as -- so, margin was down 4 basis points linked quarter. I wouldn\u2019t want you to you think that we expect that type of decline all the way through the end of 2017. There is a lot of factors in, Matt, as you know. The shape of the yield curve from our perspective as well as the volume and mix of loan production are the two key drivers. The yield curve has remained flat, but what is interesting is that the gap down in interest rates that we saw post Brexit has completely reversed already. And then, in the second quarter what I didn\u2019t say in my prepared remarks was we did quite a bit more of LIBOR based production in the quarter and so the mix has an impact. Our spreads actually widened a little bit, but the new business yield went down, not because of spreads, but because of mix. So, the way I would think about it is we had, if you look year-over-year, the margin was down about 9 basis points in a year, but in a year that really had some dramatic changes, both in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. So, there is more pressure -- there are more forces that are bringing the margin down than bringing the margin up today. And I think that will be in place for the balance of this year. It\u2019s too early to call 2017 at this point.","Matthew Breese","But all else being equal, you expect a leveling off and the pace wouldn\u2019t quite as dramatic?","David Rosato","That would be our expectation as we sit here today.","Matthew Breese","And then, back to the dividend and M&A. If the regulators aren\u2019t more forgiving the payout ratio and you approach 50 billion, would you be willing to manage the balance sheet to remain under 50 billion and maintain the dividend?","Jack Barnes","Yes, we would. But I would say, again, we\u2019re at 40. We have a long way to go to pass through that time and a lot of time to think about the implications of that. It\u2019s not something we\u2019re focused on today. We\u2019re much more focused on improving the level of income generation and bringing the dividend payout ratio down. So, we\u2019re committed to the dividend at the level it is with the annual $0.01 increase. And we\u2019re working real hard to improve earnings, so that that payout ratio keeps coming down.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Hersom for closing remarks.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you again for joining us today.

Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gigi and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our second quarter 2019 results are Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Tengel, President.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the second quarter overview on Slide 2. We are pleased with our second quarter performance. Operating earnings of $135 million increased 24% on a year ago and operating return on average tangible common equity of 14.6%, improved 40 basis points. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.34, up $0.02 year-over-year.","These strong results reflect continued success of our strategy, balancing organic growth with thoughtful M&A. Higher revenues and our continued emphasis on controlling costs generated a second quarter efficiency ratio of 55.8%, an improvement of 260 basis points from the prior year quarter and 150 basis points linked quarter.","Total revenues of $454 million, grew 15% from a year ago due to increases in both net interest income and non-interest income. We experienced particularly strong non-interest income result, highlighted by a record quarter for customer interest rate swap income.","The net interest margin of 3.12%, improved 2 basis points from a year ago, but declined eight basis points from the first quarter. While new business yields remained higher than the total loan portfolio yield, the margin contracted primarily due to increased deposit costs and the acquisition of Belmont.","Period end loans and deposit increased 9% and 7% respectively from March 31st, driven by the addition of Belmont and organic growth. Excluding Belmont our loan and deposit balances increased 1% and 2%, respectively.","Our organic loan growth continued to highlight the importance of our diversified business mix, strong production and mortgage warehouse lending, core middle market C&I, healthcare and equipment finance more than offset the continued headwinds in commercial real estate and planned reductions in residential mortgage balance.","We continue to see good levels of business activity across our markets and remain optimistic about the growth opportunities in the second half of the year. We are also encouraged by our continued success gathering deposits. Results this quarter benefited from higher than expected municipal balances and a large short-term deposit from a commercial customer.","Despite observing some recent modest easing and deposit pricing, we still view the market as highly competitive. As we have previously indicated, we expected deposit cost increases to continue for 2 to 4 quarters following the end of the fed tightening. As such, our deposit costs were up 10 basis points for the quarter.","However, we remain focused on controlling pricing and recently made our second move in the last two months to lower CD deposit costs. As I'm sure you all know, earlier this week, we announced the acquisition of United Financial Bancorp the holding company for United Bank.","We are excited about this financially attractive transaction that further deepens the bank's presence in Connecticut, our largest and most profitable market, and also enhances our franchise in western Massachusetts. We look forward to working closely with the United Team to integrate the companies to best serve our combined customer bases.","With the closing of the Belmont acquisition in April, we've begun to leverage our expanded customer and employee base to build upon our strong organic growth in Massachusetts, particularly in the greater Boston area. We're especially pleased with Belmont's commercial real estate team, which is generating good production.","Integration continues to go extremely well. The core system convergent will take place later this month and we remain confident in achieving the transactions attractive returns. Adding to the momentum, our franchise is generating in the greater Boston area, we opened a new branch in the Seaport District of the city earlier this week. We're excited to have a location in this vibrant and growing part of Boston to serve our customers.","We're also pleased to announce Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to 20 million common shares, which reflects our strong capital positions and commitment to returning capital to shareholders. It is important to note the share repurchases will be made at the discretion of the Company following the close of the United acquisition.","With that, here's David.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning the Slide 3, net interest income of $340.1 million was up $15.3 million or 5% from the first quarter. The loan portfolio contributed $30.8 million of the increase to net interest income and benefited from higher yields on new business. Net interesting income also benefited $2.1 million from an additional calendar day in the second quarter.","The primary offsets to these increases were higher deposit costs, which reduced net interest income by $14.4 million. In addition, lower balances in the securities portfolio and increased borrowing costs lowered net interest income by $1.8 million and $1.4 million respectively.","As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of 312 declined 8 basis points linked quarter. The loan portfolio had a 6 basis point favorable impact on the margin, as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. However, increased deposit cost caused the margin to contract 14 basis points.","Consistent with the projections we provided in April, the addition of Belmont negatively affected the margin by 6 basis points for the quarter before purchase accounting adjustments. However, the net effect of Belmont purchase accounting adjustments served to offset this impact by approximately 4 basis points.","Turning to loans on Slide 5, average balances of $38.2 billion, increased by $3.2 billion or 9% from the first quarter. On a period end basis, loans ended the quarter at $38.6 billion, up $3 billion or 9% from March 31st. These increases were driven by the addition of Belmont and organic growth.","Excluding the acquisition, average and period end balances increased $490 million and $383 million, respectively or 1% on each basis. Organic growth was primarily driven by mortgage warehouse lending, middle market C&I across the franchise and equipment finance. Mortgage warehouse balances ended the quarter at $1.2 billion, up $340 million linked quarter. C&I growth also benefited from good results in our healthcare vertical and equipment finance continued to experience strong production by LEAF.","The largest offsets to these increases were lower balances, excluding the addition of Belmont in commercial real estate and residential mortgage. Commercial real estate continues to be impacted by the headwinds we have discussed previously including elevated competition and continued higher payoff.","The reduction in residential mortgage balances was planned as we remixed the balance sheet, given recent acquisitions having a higher percentage of lower yielding residential mortgages than our standalone portfolio.","Balances in the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio, which is in runoff mode, ended the quarter at the $881 million, down $59 million from March 31st. The portfolio has runoff less than anticipated as balances have only declined $86 million since year end. As such, we now expect runoff to be $200 million to $300 million for the full year, a decrease from our expectation in January of $400 million to $500 million.","Moving onto deposits on Slide 6. Average balances of $39.2 billion, increased $2.8 billion or 8% linked quarter, while period end balances of $39.5 billion were at $2.6 billion or 7%. These results were driven by both the addition of Belmont and organic growth. Excluding the acquisition, average and period end balances increased $713 million and $600 million, respectively or 2% on each basis.","Deposits benefited from higher-than-expected municipal balances and a $500 million short-term deposit from a commercial customer. Our interest bearing deposit beta is 37% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates, up five percentage points from 32% at the end of the first quarter. In comparison, our loan yield beta is 41% during the same period, a decline of one percentage point linked quarter from 42%.","Looking at Slide 7, non-interest income had a very strong quarter at $106.3 million, an increase of nearly $12 million or 12% on a linked quarter basis. The result was primarily driven by a record quarter of customer interest rate swap income, which increased non-interest income by $4.6 million, $2.4 million in higher commercial banking lending fees reflecting higher prepayment income and loan syndication fees.","A $1.2 million increase in bank service charges, primarily resulting from an additional calendar day in the second quarter, and higher investment management and cash management fees, which collectively improve non-interest income by $1 million. Conversely, insurance revenue was down $1.8 million in the quarter reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals.","On Slide 8, non-interest expense of $278.4 million increased $1.2 million linked quarter, included in the second quarter were $6.5 million of merger related costs in the following categories, 4.7 million in professional and outside services, $1.5 million in compensation and benefits and the remaining $300,000 in occupancy and equipment and other. In comparison, the first quarter incurred $15 million of merger related costs, with nearly $12 million in other non-interest expense, primarily reflecting the cost of 15 branch closures associated with Farmington bank acquisition.","Excluding merger related costs, non-interest expenses of $271.9 million were up $9.7 million or 4% linked quarter. The largest drivers of the increase was $5.9 million in higher compensation and benefits costs, primarily reflecting the addition of Belmont and $1.4 million in increased professional and outside expenses. Overall, Belmont added approximately $7.2 million to operating expenses in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 9, the efficiency ratio of 55.8% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter and 260 basis points from a year ago. We are very pleased with the significant progress we have made and remain focused on seeking ways to improve operating leverage.","Asset quality was once again exceptional across each of our portfolios, as demonstrated on Slide 10. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and OREO at 56 basis points were up modestly linked quarter but remain below our peer group in top 50 banks. A single C&I account drove the increase in non-performing assets for the quarter.","Net charge-offs were five basis points improved from an already low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content that are non-performing assets. As we have previously said, sustaining excellent asset quality is an important lever in building long-term value and a hallmark of People's United.","As such, even though the credit environment continues to be benign and has for an extended period, we remain committed to our conservative and well defined underwriting process that has served us well for so many years.","Briefly on slides 11 and 12, return on average assets improved 8 basis point linked quarter to 104 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity increased 110 basis points to 14.1%. On an operating basis, return on average assets was 106 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was 14.4%.","As you can see on Slide 12, capital ratios remained strong, given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. Before opening the call up for questions, I want to draw your attention to Slide 13, as we have provided an update to our full year 2019 goals.","As a reminder, the goals updated in April simply reflected the addition of Belmont as People's United standalone goals were unchanged. Given the current interest rate environment and the expectation of monetary policy easing by the Federal Reserve, we have adjusted our full year goals for net interest income and net interest margin. Please note these goals do not include United Financial.","Our updated full year of 2019 goals are as follows. Net interest margin is expected to be in the range 305 to 315, compared to the previous range of 310 to 320. Embedded in this expectation is the assumption of two 25 basis point decreases in the fed funds rate. Our prior assumption was for no change in the fed funds rate during the year.","As a result of our lowered NIM expectation, we anticipate net interest income growth to be in the range of 11% to 13% down from 13% to 15%. Importantly, the full year goals for loans, deposits, non-interest income, non-interest expense, provision, effective tax rate and capital remain unchanged.","Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Casey Haire","A question for you on the NIM guide, the two cuts. Is that July, September? And then what is that assume you guys were able to do on the deposit side there to offset the asset yield pressure?","David Rosato","What the guidance is, is based on July and December cuts Casey.","Casey Haire","Okay. So, very limited, okay, so effectively one, as it relates to '19, and then what can you guys can do on the deposit side or liability side or liability side to offset that pressure?","David Rosato","Sure. So, we've done a couple of things, Jack referenced a little bit. Within the last week, we brought down some of our promotional money market rates, getting ahead of what we expect from the fed. So, we're down about 20 basis points in money markets and a couple of our larger markets.","In our CD book, we've actually made two separate moves in the last two months. So cumulatively, our six month CD special that we're running is down 30 basis points. And our 11 months is down 60 basis points cumulatively, and we actually have an inversion in our CD rates now.","It'll take a little bit of time for that to roll through. But with those moves, and more that we expect, post the fed actually moving on July 31, we'll do our best to offset as much of the NIM pressure as we can.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. Just switching to loan growth guide, the 10 to 12, I'm doing my math, right, that implies it, pretty decent range of about 700, a little less $700 million between the low and high points. How are pipeline shaping up? I know, you had a very nice mortgage warehouse quarter and that can be seasonal. Just trying to get a final point on the loan growth guidance based on pipelines?","Jack Barnes","Casey, it's Jack. I'll let Jeff, answer that and give you some color on what's going on in the different business lines and markets.","Jeff Tengel","Yes, hi, Casey, this is Jeff Tengel. We think the pipelines they are still pretty healthy, that we haven't seen a material declines or decrease in the pipelines from what we've been moving through during the first half of the year. So, our expectations are that the second half all being equal look pretty similar to the first half kind of setting aside that often times we'll see the second half has a little bit of a increase.","As we move through in December, in particular, the equipment finance businesses tend to have a very strong end of the year. We haven't seen any signs of slowdown in any of the businesses that we've been highlighting here, acknowledging the headwinds in commercial real estate, but apart from that, everything seems to be in pretty good shape.","Casey Haire","And just last from me, the other income line and obviously the swaps were very strong this quarter, but the fee guide does imply a pretty decent step down, 91, 95 in the back half of the quarter, if I'm doing my math right. Is that jive with what you guys are thinking?","David Rosato","Yes. So, Casey, the fee income is running better than we expected and we really had a great second quarter. There's some volatility, as you know, in some of those line items. So, the way I think about it is that is that strong momentum continues. We're going to be on the high end or maybe even above the guidance, but we didn't change it just because of the volatility of some of those line items.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe","You guys talked about 20 million shares that you had authorization for understand, it needs to wait until you guys closed, but can you talk about thereafter like how quickly would you like to purchase or try to finish the 20 million shares?","David Rosato","The way I would think about it, Ken, is it's important to have that in place. We are looking at that point in time opportunistically. So, we are putting out a timeframe and an expectation that all those shares will be bought immediately. It's really subject to market conditions post the close of the United transaction.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. So, it could be anywhere from the couple of quarters to two years.","David Rosato","Yes, but reasonable expectations, we sit here today.","Ken Zerbe","Understood. I guess along the same lines when we think about your capital ratios and using the 20 million shares, and it looks -- my calculation it looks like it reduces your capital ratios if you did it all in one chunk, by about 90, 100 basis points on CE Tier 1. Is there a capital level or capital ratio that you are targeting that you don't want to go below, that might be the most restrictive help us think about the timing of buybacks?","David Rosato","There is what I would say is, your number is directionally correct. We could buy all those shares back in a relatively short period of time and still be fine from our capital target.","Ken Zerbe","Okay. That helps. And then, switching gears a little bit, other fee income looks like it was one of the biggest. I don't understand your guidance for lower fee income going forward, but what was on the others fee lines because the $4.3 million in your slide?","David Rosato","There was a bunch of odds and ends. One of the main drivers was you see on the balance sheet that, we have equities, securities. We have one equity security position, which have to be mark-to-market through the income statement. That was about $800,000. We also had some a little over $400,000 of only income in the quarter, and after that it's pretty much odds and ends.","Ken Zerbe","And then, one last question if I could. In terms of this transaction on New York City multifamily portfolio, just kind of reconcile. Obviously, I heard your comments that, the payoffs are slower, but at the same time kind of you and many other banks talk about payoffs in their normal CRE portfolio being much faster. Is there anything unusual about this portfolio, why wouldn't the payoffs affect this portfolio or is this more a little more rent stabilized stuff that might stay on your books for a lot longer?","David Rosato","Yes. This is a New York broker originated multifamily. It is certainly not all rent control, but there is some portion of that portfolio that does have rent controlled properties. We had a high level of maturity in that portfolio last year and then refinancing away from us out of that portfolio. The actual maturities this year came down quite a bit, but when we gave original guidance, we were expecting the level of refinancing to remain elevated. And I think what we've all learned now, through the first six months of this year is the activity levels in that, that segment of the market have really slowed down. And that led to quite a bit of a much larger portfolio at this point in the year than the originally expected.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Jared Shaw","Just a first question on the United deal with their exposure to DC Solar, they took a $9 million write-down this quarters. Is that in addition to the write-down that you provided us on Monday? Or is that part of the evaluation that you put on there?","David Rosato","No, our 41.7, it was the full amount of the balance sheet exposure plus prior tax credits received. United's number is a subset of what we had conservatively modeled.","Jared Shaw","Okay, so these are, that $9 million is I guess we're looking at coming out of that were part of that $41.7 million total exposure not in addition.","David Rosato","Correct.","Jared Shaw","Okay. And then what's the anticipated total goodwill from the United deal?","David Rosato","I don't have that number handy right now. Give me a sec. And it's subject to quite a bit of change as March move.","Jared Shaw","Not sure yet. We can follow up after. Okay. Sure. And then just following up on Ken's question on the multifamily, when you're saying that the pace of refi is slow, are you also saying it's driven by the pace of just sale, secondary markets sales of those properties slowing and wherein in the past?","David Rosato","Yes.","Jared Shaw","So, it's not that people are holding on to their loans past that reset date, it's this more than the year anticipated sale schedules has slowed down?","David Rosato","Yes, it's just the transaction activity in that market had slowed down as people react to the new legislation.","Jared Shaw","Okay, got it. Those were the questions I was looking for. Thanks a lot.","David Rosato","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brock Vandervliet","Just following up on that last question on multifamily. Would you consider selling that portfolio since it now looks like, it may be around for much longer than we thought it would be?","David Rosato","We thought about it from time to time and we certainly could. But today, as rates go down, and it's hanging around a little longer, that's a good thing from our perspective. So, yes, I would never say, never, but I would guess we will not wind up selling those assets.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay, fair enough. And what's your sense of your rate sensitivity now relative to the shock test results we saw in the queue given Belmont, has it changed materially?","David Rosato","No, Belmont was slightly liability sensitive, but once they were aggregated into us, they are only roughly 5% of our asset size. They had a very modest impact overall.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. And you appear to using the forward curve, as you look in to next year, where the curves implies several more cuts, are you comfortable with your rate positioning or there are things you would look to do in addition to hedge that out? I guess United will help you in that regard because it is more liability sensitive.","David Rosato","Yes. United will have a small positive impact, small reduction in our asset sensitivity. I think the real question that we spent our time on is, feeling pretty good about the asset side of our balance sheet from a rate sensitivity perspective. Credit spreads have been steady. Our securities portfolio is a longer duration and provides a nice hedge there.","The hedging at where we are today is a pretty bullish state because any 10-year swap is immediately negative to carry perspective first one month LIBOR, three month LIBOR. So, we haven't rushed out to hedge anything in the derivatives market right now. If we get substantially more constructive on rates going down and the curve steepening, our outlook committee will continue to evaluate that. But as we sit here today, we are modestly asset sensitive and we are comfortable with that.","Jack Barnes","And as we told you, we are actively moving now to manage our deposit cost and we will continue to look at that if the forward curve is right on what's going to happen with short rate.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert from KBW. Your line is now open.","Collyn Gilbert","May be if we could just start, David, with some margin, the margin guidance that you guys gave 3.05 to 3.15, I know you touched on some of this, but just thinking about it in terms of the waterfall chart that you guys put in the slide deck on Slide 4 just for the impact this quarter. If we could maybe if you could walk through how that would look in your guidance? You know, you talked about a little bit on the deposit and where you're seeing, you're just seeing some promotional rates, that's helpful, but also just thinking about the loan maybe how in this scenario thinking about loan yield. I guess that's really the big thing, on the loan yield demand the borrowing side too?","David Rosato","Sure. What I would say just looking at Slide 4, the big number is the 14 basis points around deposits and what I would say is in the second quarter, what we were able to do to lower deposit costs was very modest, right. And the moves that I talked about a few minutes ago, were later in the quarter and didn't impact the quarter. When I think about the asset size side, we have about 43% of our loans are our prime or one month LIBOR. So that's where the headwind is. And I think that those loans will continue to re-price down, as one month LIBOR moves down if the forward curve is correct.","We have a nice offset in our securities portfolio, in our equipment finance business which is very nice yields, great cash flow and is all fixed rate. As I think about the back half of the year, with the fed moving, its deposit management that is, is where the work has to be done. And I just generally speaking, I think it's been hard for banks to be too aggressive in lowering deposit costs, until we get the cover up to set I think in that first move. And I think we all collectively think that's right around the corner. So our margin guidance of 3.05 to 3.15 is looking, is assuming a step down in margins of approximately three basis points a quarter is kind of how I would term it, position it today.","Collyn Gilbert","And then, if we take that, but -- and if we just transition sorry, for a minute to UBNK. So, I believe you guys had said in your deal metrics that you were using consensus estimates for 2020 I think of a $1.09. It looks as if now having digested UBNK's quarter and speaking with them that that achieving that is going to be a big challenge. How does that come into play with your outlook in terms of your EPS accretion targets and the like?","David Rosato","They're UBNK for 2019 is not going to have a big impact on us just because of the closing of the deal. This is the way we think about that is more of how we, what we do once you take once we merge with them and some of the balance sheet changes that we've made at that point, is obviously going to be dependent on time of closing and how we feel and where interest rates are at that time.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, I was it's really more of the 2020 number that I'm honing in on, like if it turns out to be $1 versus $1.09, you think you still is what you're saying you still think you have enough sort of balance sheet optionality there to recover that whatever loss earnings may happen to the Company between now and when you close the deal or now and when you integrate the deal.","David Rosato","Yes, that's our position.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. And then just on the buyback, I'm sorry, I think you said it David. So you're if we look at your capital targets, and that Tier 1, the 10 to 10.5 range. And did I hear you correctly and saying that you, even if you did execute on this buyback pro forma with UBNK, you still would have still be within those targeted capital ranges?","David Rosato","Yes, our operating target for CET 1 would allow us to buy that stock back in a relatively quicker defined a quarter or two and still be above our operating targets.","Collyn Gilbert","I guess I'm trying to figure that out. We can, may be talk offline. I guess just thinking conceptually, UBNK is going to lower your capital levels, you are not really going to generating much capital just given the probably the direction of earnings, but you're saying you will. You're so optimistic.","David Rosato","Yes, but, we are also the first thing we said on the first question that came around buyback was, we are positioning that as it's nice to have it in play, we have lowered our dividend payout ratio quite a bit over the last couple of years. It's down around 50% today. So, we have another capital management tool, but we did position it as opportunistically. So, we are not saying we'll definitely buy all those shares back in a predetermined amount of time.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay. And then just finally tying all this together with kind of a NIM guide, if we you know kind of assume that full year range that would mean in the fourth quarter you could theoretically perhaps have a NIM as low as say 2.95 or so, so you are going into 2020 with a 2.95 NIM with continued pressure kind of assume still be coming in the first quarter just because of December rate cut that would be factored in. How are you thinking about that in just totality of still wanting to generate EPS growth? Or will 2020 be a year that may be you don't generate EPS growth or you don't hit your financial target? I'm just trying to tie it all together just seems like there is going to be a meaningful drop in earnings per share in 2020 with this NIM?","Jack Barnes","Collyn, hi, it's Jack. I think that as we described on lowering the NIM guidance, we're looking at the high potential of the Fed lowering rate, right. That's a primary driver of that change in the guidance. And, as we go into through the rest of the year and into 2020, there is a lot of levers right to use to kind of place that headwind. We have described the work that we continue to do on remixing the asset on the balance sheet and improving yield and changing to make up the percentage of both portfolios. We continue to work on growing DDAs and we continue to work on our deposit cost.","So, there is a lot a different ways that we can fight the pressure on rates coming down with Fed as you know. None of us know where that's going to go really. I think our challenge and our job is to react to what is going on in the market and externally and then manage what we can manage. So again, if you were just assume that the December rate decline is going to kick in and then maybe there is another one, that's in isolation and it doesn't give us any credit for taking actions look like that off.","Collyn Gilbert","Got it. Okay.","David Rosato","I would just add to that, the 2.95 NIM that you quoted feels very aggressive to me, as we're much lower than where I think we'll wind up being and\u2026","Collyn Gilbert","Yes, sorry, what, David, like that also I have UBNK already in my model. So that includes UBNK, and next year's does not. But any way I didn't mean to interrupt. Continue?","David Rosato","So I was just going to say if the interest rate environment, it gets crystal clear that we are going to substantially lower rates, there's going to, we're going to have to take substantial action, to protect our NIM. That's both on hedging on the asset composition side, as well as the liability side.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Matthew Breese from Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Matthew Breese","Just want to continue the NIM discussion, hop on the NIM pick file so to speak. Just curious, is there any other drivers of compression and maybe you could just give us a sense for what a accretable yield amounted to this quarter for the NIM and where you expect it to go by the end of the year in terms of a headwind?","David Rosato","Really not much of a factor in the quarter, the real drivers, the positive around our NIM is we still have a nice differential between the new business that's hitting the books and our current loan portfolio yield. That's been going on for quite a few quarters now. There's, benchmark interest rates are moving down, but spreads are staying constant. And I think that metric will continue in the back half of the year as well.","Matthew Breese","And what is the difference now between the incremental new loan and what's on the books?","David Rosato","That's a little over 50 basis points.","Matthew Breese","And then is the, I know you mentioned you had a rather large $500 million commercial deposit, it sound short-term in nature. With the expectation that moves off the balance sheet, is that a driver of NIM compression as well and if so how much?","David Rosato","It was a modest driver of NIM compression in the second quarter. It won't be here for too much of the third quarter and it was on the balance sheet for about half of the second quarter.","Matthew Breese","Okay.","David Rosato","We just called it out more because it was large and it came and it will be going.","Matthew Breese","And then you mentioned that some of the growth this quarter came from the healthcare space. Could you just give us a sense for what your exposure is to the segment? What types of loans you're providing there and geographically where it's centered?","Jeff Tengel","Hi, this is Jeff again. The healthcare, our healthcare businesses, mostly senior housing, seniors, if you think about it, and it's mostly in our footprint, so we're providing financing for, assisted living skilled nursing facilities we also do, and there's not much in the way, if you think about hospitals because so many of the hospitals have consolidated in the northeast. So, there is probably a bigger concentration in the senior housing and some of the not for profit agencies.","Matthew Breese","And what's the size of that portfolio? How much did it grow this quarter?","Jeff Tengel","This quarter they grew $100 million, a little over $100 million.","Matthew Breese","On balance of...","Jeff Tengel","About 750ish.","Matthew Breese","Okay. Okay. And the my last question just with regard to CECL, we're getting pretty close to the deadline here I'm just curious, if there is any sort of additional commentary or expectations for day one and then go forward provision?","David Rosato","We are not prepared to talk about, putting any numbers out there. Our expectations will be, we'll be doing that in early October on our third quarter conference call as well as putting additional disclosure in the queue. Comments are very similar to last quarter, which is, we have a cross functional team across the banks. It's been work on CECL for over a year now. We have developed all of our models. We're just about ready to start parallel testing on the back half of the year and we'll provide more clarity in three months.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Brock Vandervliet from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brock Vandervliet","Thanks for the follow-up. Just on accounting, purchase accretion for Q2, do you have that number?","David Rosato","I don't off the top of my head. It was similar to -- somewhat similar to last quarter. I can follow up with what the exact number was.","Brock Vandervliet","Okay. Yes, I think it was $6 million last quarter. Great, I'll follow up offline.","David Rosato","Okay. Thanks.","Brock Vandervliet","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, we are pleased with our strong second quarter performance, which was highlighted by a 24% increase in operating earnings from a year ago, 260 basis point improvement year-over-year in the efficiency ratio reflecting higher revenues, particularly strong non-interest income growth and well controlled expenses, solid organic loan and deposit growth, new business yields remaining higher than the total loan portfolio yield and the sustained exceptional asset quality.","Thank you for your interest in People's United.

My name is Regina, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our third quarter results. Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of our presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. As always, we appreciate your joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our third quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $64.4 million or $0.19 per share, down from $67.2 million or $0.20 per share in the second quarter. Net income for the quarter was $62.2 million or $0.18 per share.","Operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% compared to 3.88% in the second quarter. The decline in the margin is primarily the result of lower loan yields which was partially offset by lower funding costs.","Total loan growth amounted to 8.8% on an annualized basis. We are very pleased to see this increased momentum, which is significant when considering the runoff in our acquired portfolios.","Noninterest income in the quarter increased $5.7 million to $81.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher prepayment fees, seasonally strong insurance revenues, higher gain on sale of residential mortgages and increased operating lease income.","We are particularly pleased with the progress on our efficiency ratio, which improved to 61.4% from 61.5% in the second quarter. We were able to drive operating leverage while absorbing the full quarter expenses of the Citizens branch acquisition. With the growing balance sheet, supported by strategic revenue initiatives and identified expense reductions scheduled in the quarters ahead, we look forward to continued progress on our efficiency ratio as we push towards our goal of 55%.","Asset quality, a longtime hallmark of this institution, continues to impress as net charge-offs totaled just 18 basis points this quarter, which is the lowest level since the second quarter of 2009.","During the quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.5 million at a weighted average price of $11.90 per share. Year-to-date, we repurchased 13.5 million shares or $164 million at a weighted average price of $12.12 per share. This results in approximately $8.6 million of annual dividend saving. We have 4.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.","Capital ratios remain strong, with the tangible equity ratio at 11.2% for the third quarter. We continue to make progress deploying in our capital through balance sheet growth, dividend payments and share repurchase activity.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.89% net interest margin for the quarter. Lower loan yields negatively impacted the margin by 9 basis points, approximately 5 basis points of this decline related to the runoff of higher yielding loans in the acquired loan portfolio. The other 4 basis point decline related to a combination of originated loans coming on at lower rates, payoff and repricing.","Cost recovery income, which represents settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio in excess of the carrying amount, continued this quarter and amounted to $4.1 million, down from $4.7 million last quarter, which negatively impacted the margin by 1 basis point. These forces are partially offset by a 3 basis point improvement in funding rates and mix. Deposit costs are 41 basis point, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 58 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. As a reminder, the favorable effect of fair value amortization on acquired time deposits in the Danvers acquisition will end this month and negatively impact our fourth quarter net interest margin by approximately 2 basis points. In this rate environment, opportunities continue to exist to lower deposit cost. For example, average deposits and acquired markets represent approximately 17% of total average deposits, with a weighted average cost of 77 basis points, which reflects progress, but is still well above our franchise wide cost of deposits.","In addition, we continue to improve our DDA mix. Overall, we anticipate a similar decline in our net interest margin next quarter, driven by the acquired loan portfolio runoff, lower absolute rates and the expiration of the fair value amortization on acquired time deposits.","On Slide 4, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.82% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is a cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost, stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by approximately $900 million of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years.","Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide. Slide 5 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $49 million, down from $56 million in the second quarter. The runoff in the acquired portfolio reached its highest level this quarter, as $383 million of loans paid off, matured or were settled, with just $32 million relating to Fin Fed. We now expect the acquired Fin Fed portfolio to remain with us into 2013. While we'd prefer that some of these loans had stayed with us, we have seen approximately $100 million of improvement this quarter in criticized and classified assets within the acquired loan portfolios.","The carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $2.6 billion. Recall, these portfolios totaled $5.4 billion in aggregate as of their respective acquisition dates. Overall, we remain confident that our credit marks will be sufficient to cover the anticipated loss content in these portfolios.","Slide 6 illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you will see that we booked total accretion of $49 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance in the acquired loan portfolio, gives an effective yield of 6.90%. Weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.39%. This is actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.90% effective yield, the weighted average coupon of 5.39%, amounts to $10.6 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the third quarter shows that 17 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion.","So if you want to think about our core underlying margin, excluding the noncash accretion, it would be operating -- it'd be our operating net interest margin at 3.82%, less the 17 basis points or 3.65%. The noncash accretion was equivalent to $0.02 per share this quarter, as shown on the right-hand side of the page, which is similar to prior quarters.","Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or are settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.","Slide 7 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolio grew 8.8% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States, and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank, while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards.","Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $835 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $722 million quarter-over-quarter. C&I and CRE expansion contributed 82% of this growth, with increases of $310 million and $286 million, respectively.","Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our mortgage warehouse lending business in both equipment and finance businesses, People's United Equipment Finance and PCLC, grew originated loans of $147 million, $72 million and $43 million, respectively, in the quarter. The mortgage warehouse lending business is one that is well known to us through years of experience. We are comfortable with the credit. And while the growth rate will likely slow from here a bit, it does have room to grow over the next 2 years, and is likely to continue to contribute nicely, given the low interest rate environment. Originated residential mortgages grew by $97 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 51% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages and 58% of the pipeline is Jumbo product. Third quarter 2012 average loan size or our close loans originated in the quarter was $316,000, while the average loan size for our loans added to the portfolio conforming or Jumbo was $596,000.","Average FICO score for our third quarter originations was 758, with an average LTV of 68%. Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $197 million in commitments, compared to $164 million in the second quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size, the third quarter originations was $133,000. The average FICO score was 7.60%, with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are originated in the branches.","The acquired portfolio declined by $383 million. As we noted in the past, it is difficult to predict the rate of decline in the acquired portfolios. That said, we continue to manage the business with an eye towards growing our total loan balance at a mid- to high-single digits growth rate.","You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the element contributing to a modest decrease in deposits, which occurred this quarter, while we further reduce total deposit cost. Third quarter is seasonally our weakest period with respect to retail deposit flows, as customers tend to spend more during the summer months. In addition, we continue to improve the mix of our deposit base, as higher-cost time deposits decreased by $154 million.","Larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of the recently acquired branches in New York. I am encouraged to see that we experienced DDA growth of 11% year-over-year, excluding the recently acquired branches in New York, and have seen good activity with respect to new account openings in the recently acquired branches.","Slide 9 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share.  Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at a compound annual rate of 21% and 20%, respectively.","Slide 10 provides a breakout of non-interest income, which increased $5.7 million from the second quarter. The income areas that demonstrate a momentum included loan prepayment fees and seasonally strong insurance, which increased $2.5 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Gain on sale of residential mortgages posted another strong quarter, producing income of $3.6 million, up $800,000 from last quarter and equal to first quarter levels. Other areas of strength included operating lease income and bank service charges, which were largely offset by weaker brokerage income. As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The first and third quarters tend to be stronger than the second and fourth quarters.","On Slide 11, you can see that our non-interest expense base increased to $209 million from $206 million last quarter. During the quarter, we incurred $3.2 million of nonoperating expenses, $2.4 million of which related to the recent branch acquisition and $800,000 related to severance. As we think about non-interest expense, we are focused on the operating non-interest expense base. The third quarter operating expense base was $205.7 million, which included $7.6 million related to the recently acquired branches, and was up from $202.1 million last quarter. The impact of the recently acquired branches is partially offset by lower compensation and benefit, as well as professional and outside service reductions, which declined $1.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively.","Clearly, we are able to make better-than-anticipated progress and expense control this quarter. As a result, we now anticipate full year 2012 operating expenses to be in the range of $815 million to $820 million, as opposed to our prior guidance of a $825 million to $830 million.  We remain committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down while we grow revenues.","On Slide 12, we provide the historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. Since first quarter 2010, we significantly improved our operating leverage, as can be seen in our much improved efficiency ratio, which has declined from 76.1% to 61.4% this quarter or 15%. This quarter, we absorbed an additional $6.9 million of operating expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York, and still the efficiency ratio improved modestly.","Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent pretty quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.59% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks.","Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 18 basis points compared to 26 basis points last quarter. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets, and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 52% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues, and typically have very few new credit event each quarter.","On Slide 15, you can see the details for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.22%, with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. The provision for loan losses this quarter of $15.1 million reflects $9.4 million in net charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $5.7 million for acquired loans impairment and $4.8 million associated with loan growth. As we said earlier, overall, we remain confident in the credit marks of our acquired portfolios despite the lumpiness of both costs, recovery income and impairment, as individual loans and our pools reached the end of their lives.","Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 91 basis points, down slightly from the last quarter. However, these metrics does not reflect how we feel about our progress. The strong loan growth momentum and efficiency ratio improvement, while absorbing a full quarter of expenses associated with the recently acquired branches in New York.","It is important to reflect upon the progress that we have made since the management changed in the second quarter of 2010. We have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, expansion of business lines and through a thoughtful deployment of capital. We have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform, related high cost of compliance, the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment and a weak economic recovery. Through all of this, we have seen strong improvement in our return on average assets, and improved performance so that we are now performing at the same level as our peers.","Slide 17 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity with the low levels -- from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvements in this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity, tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with a return on average tangible equity of 12.3%.","Slide 18 illustrates our substantial progress since 2010 on a dividend payout ratio. We expect progress to continue in the quarters ahead on the improved profitability and continued share repurchase activity.","On Slide 19, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong, with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.2% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 7.8% and 10.7% as of the second quarter, respectively.","We have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. We currently estimate that the Basel III proposal will negatively impact our risk-based capital ratios by anywhere from 50 to 100 basis points on an as-proposed or fully phased in basis. While we have studied the release, it is important to remember that the regulations are proposed at this point, and some sections are still subject to revision and interpretation.","Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate and the slow economic growth environment continues to include growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income, maintaining excellent credit quality and maintaining our conservative position within the investment portfolio. Our robust pipelines in the strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a substantial, sustainable, competitive advantage.","This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you all have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Preeti S. Dixit - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is actually Preeti Dixit on for Steve. A quick question on your C&I loan growth, obviously very strong in the quarter, and I know you mentioned the leasing business, as well as the mortgage warehouse. And we've heard a lot of banks speak about their commercial customers pulling back here with the upcoming elections, the fiscal cliff. Is this something you guys are seeing or does it look like demand can hold up here? It's pretty strong in the quarter.","John P. Barnes","Yes, we actually are really pleased with the quarter. As we said, we saw solid growth in the portfolios across the franchise in the different geographic regions along with the growth in the business lines like mortgage warehouse. And we're not seeing any slowdown at all. We have very healthy pipelines, a lot of activities in our loan committees and a lot of closings anticipated here as we move through the next few months.","Preeti S. Dixit - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then with regards to the lower $815 million to $820 million expense range that you gave for 2012, can you give us an update on how far along you are in your initiatives and maybe what's driving the lower guidance? And then, do you see much more room to lower that in 2013? Or is this a good run rate for you?","John P. Barnes","Well, we expect and in our commentary reflected the fact that we continue to work on and expect that we will bring down our absolute level of expenses. At this point, we have not given any guidance beyond the balance of this year. We will typically do that when we release earnings for the fourth quarter in January, which are, as you know, everybody is going through the planning process right now and so it's a little early to have anything out for the -- for next year. But I think you can see quarter-by-quarter, we continue to make progress in the base expenses. And I think this quarter was encouraging because we absorbed $7.6 million of expenses from the Citizens branch acquisition, and was able to absorb part of those in our run rate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jack, kind of on exactly, you're on Page or Slide 16. You mentioned that you didn't think that the ROA really reflects the bank's progress. My question to you though is when does it? Like at what point and what do you need? I mean, do you need higher rates before you really start to see the benefit in ROA?","John P. Barnes","No. I mean, I think the slide does reflect some pretty steady progress forward. What we need is continued growth in our lending portfolios, both on the core franchise along with new markets and continued growth in our fee income businesses, which as well continue to move along nicely. So it's just continued progress. And as we just indicated in answering the last question, and it was pointed out, we've made good progress in the expense management front, too. So it's just improving performance and continuing to move along in that fashion.","Kirk W. Walters","But certainly -- Ken, it's Kirk. If you can get short-term interest rates up, we would be happy to see them up a little bit, too.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'll see what I can do about that.","Kirk W. Walters","I appreciate that.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, just one quick question. Would you guys mind explaining again the cost recovery income? Say, I gave -- came away last quarter thing, it was a little more one-time in nature, but...","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, the cost recovery income comes about from when we have settlements on loans. Our payoffs or any activity that the loan goes off the books and the acquired portfolios at a number higher, proceeds higher than where it's been marked. And what we've said about it is we do pull it out of our operating net interest margin. And what we've said is that we believe that it is transactional in nature, and it is hard to predict. So we have had a couple of quarters here, $4.6 million, $4.1 million of cost recovery come in. We do expect as we go forward that there will be some of this come in, but it's just hard to predict quarter-to-quarter how much and the frequency and timing of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you discuss, I guess, your New York commercial real estate effort and where you are? And I was beginning to see some origination volume and traction with that portfolio?","John P. Barnes","Sure. So we're basically -- there's 2 -- there's several things going on there. But if you -- the way we are managing forward and framing that, we've done 2 things. We have hired the team that we have talked about previously, and they are now up and running, if you will. We've had some nice contribution this quarter from some preclosings [ph] that were completed before the end of September, and we have continued progress into this quarter, this current quarter. So we're very pleased with the momentum of the team. As additional cover around that, the gentleman that we hired, the executive to lead that group, is also managing all of our New York commercial real estate effort. And so we have, for instance, moved in the Long Island commercial real estate group under his supervision. And he's had the time to spend with them on that portfolio, recognized customers that he's dealt with before to build on those relationships. And then, we've had a number of folks we've mentioned in the past that we've made many deals in New York City and have relationships from the legacy People's United Connecticut franchise. And we have taken that portfolio and the relationship managers there and moved them into that group, too. So I think you can all think of our New York commercial real estate effort as a 1-business unit looking to do general commercial real estate lending, including multifamily, across the entire state. And we're very pleased with the momentum that we have seen so far, and the feel for how we've reshaped the oversight and ability to progress as we go forward.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Kirk, has anything changed with your expected dilution from the branch acquisition, given the cost reductions you had this quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","I think when we look at the acquisition specifically, no. I think that we were encouraged this quarter that we saw other cost reductions come down to help offset part of it. But when you look at the specifics relating to that Citizens branch acquisition, at this point, there would be no changes in them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Kirk, just to go back, sorry to harp on it, but on the expense discussion. So the new guidance for 2012 for the year, the $815 million to $820 million, assuming I'm looking at the right numbers, that would assume a pretty meaningful drop then in the fourth quarter [indiscernible]?","Kirk W. Walters","No. I think if you look at the year, it's really the third quarter being down a little bit from the third quarter.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","But the $815 million to $820 million -- okay, so let me ask you this. Is that -- it's backing out certain items?","Kirk W. Walters","It's our operating expense. I don't know if you're looking at total expenses or you're looking at just operating.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if I look at the back schedule of the press release, when you guys break through your operating expense, that's the number I should be looking at?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, right, the $205 million.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. All right. And then on the NIM, your comment on the NIM expecting a similar drop in the fourth quarter to what we saw in the third quarter, is that coming off of the 3.82% base or the 3.89 % base?","Kirk W. Walters","Coming off the 3.82% base.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then, just the change -- sorry, I should have asked this. The change in the expense guidance, does that change the timing of your 55% efficiency target?","Kirk W. Walters","No. I think that what we've seen this quarter is we had down, and certainly some things continued progress a little faster. But at this point, we are not changing the guidance we have out there.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. What's kind of the funding strategy right now? Seeing the drop in sort of retail deposits in the boosted borrowings a bit or was said for purchases, I guess, how are you thinking about funding? And I guess tied to that, I would think there still would be room for you guys to lower the CD costs a bit here. Maybe if you could just comment on those 2 points?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. In terms of -- let me take the last and first, in terms of the CD cost, if you look at where rack rates and such are, we've definitely lowered them. And it's really a case at this point of the acquired CDs running off. As I mentioned, 17% of our deposits are the acquired deposits. They have an average rate of 77 basis points. So we are seeing in the old Bank of Smithtown as well as Danvers portfolios month-by-month the CD is rolling down and into more current rates. In terms of the first question on the funding, we really haven't changed much in terms of strategy. Third quarter is seasonally always our lightest quarter. Our lowest point in terms of deposits intends to build from there. And what we did see during the quarter certainly was continued good loan activity. And probably as we go forward, I think there's a possibility, if we continue to have real good loan activity, then it could outstrip our deposit growth. If that occurred, we could continue to see some modest increase in borrowing. But as far as the third quarter goes, a lot of that is just normal seasonal liquidity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On the commercial real estate production, what were you seeing for yields on those assets, multifamily and then kind of office, industrial? How did that break out during the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the -- we really haven't given breakout in terms of specific categories. I think when we -- the way we tend to think about all of our lending efforts tends to be more in spreads instead of yields. And really, it spreads in the CRE business. We look at spreads running about 2.25 to 2.75 over whatever is the term of the loan. We did, when you -- if you look at it on a linked-quarter basis, we did see some compression in those spreads as compared to last quarter, which would've been a little bit higher. And I think part of that is, is the New York commercial real estate business that we have coming in that -- and some of the multi-family stuff is probably a little tighter in spreads. But that's what it's been running about, 2.25 to 2.75 over what is some kind of -- whatever is the matched cost of funds.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the multi-family business, is most of your product treasury-based or indexed?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the multifamily product that happened in the city, that tends to be priced off of treasuries. But the way we do the pricing, we convert the treasury base to mid-swaps. So we tend to price everything here off of more mid-LIBOR swaps on a consistent terms.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so on multifamily originations, how do you think about, kind of following up on Collyn's question, the funding of a 3%, 3.25% multifamily loan, how far out would you go if that was a 5-year type of structure? How much loan money would you put against that?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, when we think of funding, we're looking at funding our entire balance sheet. And so remember, that 40% of our assets are floating, and which is part of the pain and suffering we have with the low interest rate. And so, we really don't look at it loan by loan. In terms of our internal pricing systems, if it was a 5-year loan, we would put 5-year money against it, et cetera. But when we're thinking about funding the entire balance sheet, it's really much more about the -- or funding overall the balance sheet, not necessarily loan by loan.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, the mortgage warehouse business, what's the size of that portfolio now, and where could that go?","Kirk W. Walters","The size of that portfolio is right at $600 million in terms of outstanding. They tend to run. The commitments, when you look at commitments, it's probably close to $1 billion. I would say in more normal times, utilization in that business tends to run more around 45%, 50%. But obviously, with the  activity on the mortgage refinance business, it's been a little stronger than that. And I think in terms of where it's going, the continued growth, we've been encouraged that it continued to add new customers on, new clients. And that well, we believe we'll continue to see the overall customer base expand some. On the other hand, over time, I think utilization rates will revert more back to the norm.","John P. Barnes","They've done a great job. They certainly have a unit that can continue to grow and scale all the infrastructure there, a very experienced group and a great team. And we're real pleased, as Kirk said, with the progress they have made to date. And we don't see their momentum slowing down in terms of continuing to build the customer base, which will get broader.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Question for you. On the yield on the residential mortgage loans, it looks like they increased by 7 basis points during the quarter. Anything unique to get that as a higher yield?","Kirk W. Walters","That's our good friend, cost recovery income. But as we see that coming in, in different pools and such, that's what really drove up that yield. So...","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So none that's always sustainable or anything?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. And then, Damon, if you look at the Page 13 of our press release, there's actually a footnote there, I believe it's Footnote 6, that will give you what the number would be without it.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I got you, yes. Okay, that would've been 3.75%, okay. And then my other question, could you just give us an update on the wealth management? I know you guys have been trying to focus on growing that out. And it looked like brokerage commissions were down this quarter versus last quarter. I don't know if that something seasonal or maybe you could just give us an update on how you're viewing that segment of your business?","John P. Barnes","Sure. I'll do that, Damon. This is Jack. A couple of things are going on there broadly in the wealth management business. We feel very good about the progress that we've made to move that business forward, particularly incrementally in taking on our team in Boston. They have hit the ground running and are ahead of the plan, and we're real pleased with how that's going. So on a broad level, moving forward, regarding the brokerage income, we really did see in this quarter that the consumer, the trading volume in the mutual fund area slowed significantly. And so, that activity is slowing down. It slowed our fee income in that area. And that is the reflection of what's going on in the broader market, and as we continue to observe and hear about in terms of lower volumes generally in the equity markets.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill + Partner.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Question for you. It looks like each year in the third quarter, other income blips up by a few million dollars. Why is that? Is there some seasonal item in there?","Kirk W. Walters","The primary seasonal item that we have is insurance.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","But this is in other income, not in the insurance line?","Kirk W. Walters","Oh, you mean in other, other down there. That -- right. If you look at this quarter in particular, it's really prepayment fees that blipped up. I called out in my presentation, I think it was about $2.5 million.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. Second question, the FDIC released their deposit market share data, I guess, about 1.5 weeks or so ago. And it looks like you guys have been taking a lot of deposit market share in the state of Connecticut, but losing a fair amount of share in Massachusetts. Why is that? Is there some competitive dynamic up in Massachusetts that make -- making it even difficult to hold deposit share there?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I appreciate you noticing the Connecticut piece. We feel very good about that. In Massachusetts, you really have the impact of the transition with the acquisitions and the changes we're making in the funding costs there. So we are migrating both the Danvers and River customer bases to our pricing schedules, if you will. And we have lost some of the CD balances and in some cases, money market accounts to -- that we're getting premium rates in those areas. So we're -- the most of that change in the Massachusetts piece is coming from that effect, if you will.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, you guys have been relatively quiet on the M&A front for a little while here. Do you think additional acquisitions are likely for People's over the next few quarters?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I guess that's fair to say we've been quiet. It is -- right now, our take is kind of several things. First, as I've said before, we continue to strengthen and build our relationships across the Northeast and feel very good about that. But that said, it's a very uncertain environment, both with the low rates in the economy and the regulatory environment. And we think that the M&A has been quiet, and we don't see that general environment changing too fast.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the provision line. I know it came in kind of the high end of your guidance, and you did mention the provision on acquired loans, the $5.7 million. Is that simply just related to sort of the reassessment of certain pools and sort of like you get the credit recovery on some pools, where the cash flows are greater than expected on other pools, you make other adjustments that result in low provision? Is that the right way to think about it?","Kirk W. Walters","That's exactly the right way to think about it. I mean, if we look at sort of the overall credit marks, we still feel pretty good about them in all the acquisitions. But as you know, you divvy it up pool by pool, or in the case of Bank of Smithtown, we also had quite a few individual loans. So you really do run into the situation where on some pools, you're fine or maybe even heavy, and you're reclassifying some over. And on others, you need to provide for via the provisioning. I think one thing to look at though is if you consider sort of the unusual adjustments that have gone through relating to the acquired loans reflected in cost recovery income up in the margin and the impairment down in the provision, they're roughly equal. And so, it's a little bit of a push and pull between them.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then as you think about your provision costs in the fourth quarter, are you still in kind of the $10.5 million to $15 million range and would any amount of provision on acquired loans be a big piece of sort of what end of that range you ended up in?","Kirk W. Walters","As we think about the fourth quarter, I think $10 million to $15 million is the right range in there. We're certainly on sort of the on the ground, and the originated portfolio has been running sort of low into that range, the $10 million to $11  million type number. This quarter, we did pick up the -- some impairments on the acquired portfolios. But that is just going to be lumpy, depending as we get into this quarter, whether we see much more. My guess is that impairments will be lower quarter-to-quarter in terms of fourth to third.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Tom Alonso with Macquarie.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","Most of my questions have been answered at this point. Just a quick one on the mortgage banking -- the mortgage warehouse stuff, or when you guys say that the utilization rate is sort of 45% to 50%, and it's elevated now, are these new relationships to you? Are you sort of the primary line of credit for these new relationships? Or is there somebody who already has a bank or 2, and then they add you just to get broader access?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think you'd probably want to think about that 2 ways. As we've told you, our team that has established this business here with People's United, it comes in 2 angles, some very significant historical relationships we had here for probably a couple of decades. And then, we've hired the team, and they had long-standing relationships that move to them very quickly. So new to People's United Bank, but not new relationships to the team, if you will. And most of those relationships, where the company we're lending to is substantial do have 2 or 3, sometimes 4-line relationships. So they're dealing with people. This is a very focused specialized business, and they're dealing with people that have -- that are similar to our team and very focused on. And they'll set up several facilities, and then they'll decide how to make them active based on service levels and the like.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Sorry to ask on mortgage banking again. What was sort of the -- what was the average balance in the second quarter of that warehouse in the third quarter? I mean, it sounded like $450 million or $500 million is normal, maybe over $600 million or $700 million in the last 2 quarters, maybe any numbers would be helpful?","Kirk W. Walters","I think if we look at the averages and you're talking about the mortgage warehouse business, right?","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Yes, yes, yes, sorry.","Kirk W. Walters","I think if you look at in terms of sort of the averages, it would be a little north of $500 million. I think they had a pretty solid quarter, and did build a bit as we got toward the end of the quarter. But I would say probably an average, a little north the $500 million is a pretty good one.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the same in the second quarter it was, maybe a little light and smaller than that?","Kirk W. Walters","No. I think if you go to the second quarter, I would probably lop about $100 million off of that because it is a business that we have been continuing to add relationships and extend lines. So we certainly did see it grow on a linked-quarter basis.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the -- following up on the securities portfolio yield, it dropped 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter. I know rates are lower and prepayments are high. Was there premium amortization in there that maybe adversely impacted that or anything unusual?","Kirk W. Walters","No. There's -- I mean, first, on the premium income, we would have been pretty careful. In fact, if you recollect last year in the third quarter, we took some pretty large gains on our securities portfolio, and we sold out everything that had a high premium on them because it concerns our prepayment. So if you look at our book today, the price-to-book is just a little over $100 million, maybe $101 million. So we have very little premium amortization flowing through. I do think what is happening quarter-to-quarter is first, as we continue to add securities, which we did in the third quarter, we're bringing on CMOs at -- with an average life of 2.9 years that are coming on at a rate lower than the overall portfolio, which impacts it. And we also have amortizing in the securities portfolio is some 15-year mortgage backs that were bought 2, 3 years ago. And that balance continues to run down. So I think that's the combination of it. But we have very little premium risk in that portfolio. And, Mike, if you look at it, the overall duration of the portfolio, it's right at 2.9 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Werner with MorningStar Equity Research.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I promise I don't have a mortgage banking question. On the acquired CD portfolio, how laddered or how lumpy is it? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much is going to reprice fourth quarter versus 2013?","Kirk W. Walters","That's not a number that I have right in my head in terms of giving you a number. So if we could, either myself or Peter, will follow back up with you and get you that number. But that's -- you've asked a question, and in spite of all this paper in front of me, I don't have that one here.","Dan Werner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the other question I had was from  the Citizens branch acquisition, how much runoff have you experienced so far from those deposits?","Kirk W. Walters","Actually, overall, those deposits have held up fine on a linked-quarter basis. If anything, they're up a bit from where they were when we acquired them. There was only about $320 million in those branches. And the activity has remained good in terms of getting new accounts, particularly DDAs and seeing those increase. You might recollect when we did that deal, the average weighted cost in those branches was in the low 40s. So we really didn't have a bunch of high-cost deposits in it. I think the thing that we're really encouraged about is how quickly the team over there has started generating residential mortgages and home equity credit lines.","John P. Barnes","They're a great group. They're very well trained, and they are eager to get into our mortgage, home equity certification programs and produce, and they're doing it. It's great. It's working out, and very, very good.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Steven Alexopoulos.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up. I was looking at the chart off in NPAs, and they didn't seem to move this quarter. I just want to double check, did you adopt the new OCC guidance on secured debt? It's not obvious, looking at your numbers.","Kirk W. Walters","Let me just go back to the first statement, Steve. I think if you look at the nonperformers on our originated portfolio, which is what's in the graph, they were relatively flat this quarter. But in terms of acquired, which we also give in the release, acquired NPAs was down on a linked-quarter basis, right around $35 million. And in terms of our charge-offs, they were about 18 basis points. If you are referring to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy question that's been rattling around with some of the bigs, is that your second question?","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, yes. That's exactly what I'm referring to.","Kirk W. Walters","Where we're at on that is -- so you know is that first, in terms of any loans that are in bankruptcy and such, under our -- the way we account for them, we automatically put them on nonaccrual. So all of those loans are on nonaccrual. And we've always followed the guidance of marking them to 90% of the appraised value. So we didn't use discounted cash flows. So for us, that issue, which is a, I think the regulators have said, it's a narrowing of the interpretation of the possibilities under GAAP. Well, what that will do is it will increase our TDRs for next quarter as we fully implement it and...","John P. Barnes","Very modest.","Kirk W. Walters","It's very modest. It probably increases TDRs in maybe 10- to 15-type of range. But there should be no P&L impact relating to it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of our event today.

First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Brian and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purpose. ","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our first quarter 2016 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Senior Executive Vice President; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 1 of the presentation, which is posted on our website at peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Turning to the overview with the first quarter on slide 2, our performance this quarter reflects our continued focus on further improving profitability, while moving the company forward with a long term view. ","Net income of $63 million or $0.21 per share, represents a 6% increase from the prior year quarter or 5% increase on a per share basis. On a linked quarter basis, net income was down from $71 million or $0.23 per share. However, as a reminder, fourth quarter net income included net after tax gain of $6 million or $0.02 per share, resulting from the sale of the company\u2019s payroll services business. ","Revenues increased 2% from the prior year quarter and were essentially flat on a linked quarter basis when adjusted for the gains and sale of the payroll business. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth and higher average balances in the securities portfolio. While non-interest income was negatively impacted primarily by lower bank services charges and commercial banking lending fees. ","Total expenses were generally consistent on both a linked quarter basis and compared to the prior year quarter. As we have discussed before, we remain committed to our proactive expense management approach to tightly control cost while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance. ","Period-end loans grew for the 22nd consecutive quarter, although the 1% annualized growth rate is at slower pace than in recent periods, as the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for loan growth. Residential mortgage results remained strong with growth of 11% annualized, while commercial loan balances were slightly lower from year-end, however on a quarterly average basis, commercial loans grew more than 4% annualized. ","Given deposits are a large component of profitability and integral part of customer relationships, we are pleased with our continued success growing deposits as evidenced by the 11% annualized growth in organic deposits since year-end. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further broad based growth. ","With that I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail. ","David Rosato","Thank you Jack. On slide 3, we provide the detail behind the linked quarter increase and net interest income for the fourth quarter. Net interest income continued to benefit from loan growth, as well as our decision to increase the size of the securities portfolio in recent periods in light of the prolonged low interest rate environment. Even with this increase, the securities portfolio as a percentage of total assets remains low relative to peers at 17%. These benefits to net interest income were partially offset by an increase in borrowing cost and the impact of one less calendar day in the first quarter. ","On slide 4, we display the drivers behind the decline in net interest margin of 4 basis points from the fourth quarter to 283. New loan volume favorably impacted the margin by 3 basis points, as new business yields were higher than the total loan portfolio yield. One less calendar day in the first quarter, a lower securities portfolio yield, and higher borrowing cost each negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points. The lower securities portfolio yield was driven in large part by a reduction in the dividend rate paid on Federal Reserve Bank stock ","Turning to slide 5, the loan portfolio grew $100 million or 1% annualized from the fourth quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled 132 million. Retail contributed a 133 million of originated loan growth, which was driven by strong residential mortgage growth of a 154 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio. As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. ","Originated loans in the commercial portfolio decreased $1 million from the fourth quarter. Commercial real estate and equipment financing contributed total originated growth of $27 million and $5 million respectively, while C&I originated balances declined by 33 million. ","Within C&I the mortgage warehouse quarter-end balance was 965 million up 2 million from year-end. We experienced acquired loan run-off of 32 million this quarter compared to 45 million in the fourth quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was 764 million ","Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the fourth quarter. Total deposits increased 688 million or 10% on annualized basis. We reduced broker deposits by 33 million during the quarter, therefore organic deposit growth was 721 million or 11% annualized. Commercial and retail grew deposits by $494 million and $194 million respectively. ","In commercial, the seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable impact on deposits of 333 million during the first quarter. Just as a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth. It is also worth noting that our loan to deposit ratio was 98% at March 31, and our cost of deposits were consistent with the fourth quarter. ","On slide 7, we take a closer look at non-interest income which declined $2 million or 2% compared to the fourth quarter, when adjusting for the $9.2 million gain on the sale of the payroll services business. Insurance revenues increased non-interest income by $1.8 million primarily due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals; in addition lower bank service charges and volume related commercial banking lending fees negatively impacted non-interest income by 1.2 million and 1.1 million respectively. ","On slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Total expenses of $217.3 million were flat with the fourth quarter, but better than the first quarter expectations we set forth at year-end. Included in fourth quarter total expenses was $2.5 million of write-downs of banking health assets related to lease buy-outs of previously closed branches. ","We did not have any write-downs of banking health assets in the first quarter, despite the closure of one branch. Total expenses in the first quarter were impacted by higher compensation and benefits, which increased 2.1 million from the fourth quarter, as a result of traditionally higher first quarter payroll related and benefit costs. In addition expenses related to regulatory assessments and occupancy and equipment were up $900,000 and $500,000 respectively. ","The primary offset to these increases was a $500,000 improvement in cost pertaining to outside and professional services. As you will recall on our conference call in January, we guided the first quarter expenses of approximately $222 million. Actual first quarter results were better than expectations due to lower costs related to volume driven incentives, healthcare, as well as seasonal expenses given the mild winter in the northeast. ","The next slide displays our efficiency ratio over recent quarters. As you are aware, beginning with results this quarter, we are no longer classifying expenses related to ordinary and reoccurring branch closures and severance is non-operating. In prior periods, these expenses were excluded from our efficiency ratio calculation. For comparability purposes, we have included on the slide what the metric would have been in prior periods with the inclusion of these expenses. While the efficiency ratio is higher due to the reporting change, overall trends are generally consistent. ","Continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the company. Slide 10 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios, originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 68 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 80 basis points in the first quarter of 2015.","As you may have noticed in our recently filed proxy statement, we have adjusted the composition of our peer group for 2016 to account for significant changes in the competitive landscape among financial institutions, including completed or recently announced acquisitions. For a list of companies in our revised peer group, please see page 17 of the presentation. ","Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets as well as our conservative and well defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. As shown on slide 11, return on average assets decreased from recent quarters and continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment. ","Our return on average tangible equity was 9.4% for the first quarter, a decrease of 130 basis points on a linked quarter basis, but an improvement of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see progress in this metric over time. ","Turning to slide 12, capital levels at the holding company in the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. The tangible equity ratio improved 10 basis points from year-end to 730 primarily as a result of an improvement in the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio. Capital ratios at the bank also improved from year-end, due to an equity contribution from the holding company in order to create a more cost effective capital structure. ","Finally, on slide 13, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes as well as yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates, particularly in an immediate parallel rate [job] scenario. Our short-end asset sensitivity is slightly lower than at year-end and as long as long-end rates came down in the first quarter, we became more susceptible to lower long-end rates as evidenced by the down 100 basis points yield curve twist scenario. ","Now with that, I\u2019ll pass it back to Jack to wrap up. ","Jack Barnes","Thank you David. As we have mentioned before, we remain committed to making investments that create value for both customers and shareholders. As such, we are pleased to announce today the acquisition of Eagle Insurance Group, a full service agency and customer focused commercial insurance broker based in eastern Massachusetts. The acquisition deepens the company\u2019s presence in the region as well as expands our already strong relationship and expertise in commercial loans. ","Additionally, we continue to strategically in talent throughout the organization to further move the company forward. In recent months, we have brought on board two key leaders who will enhance our revenue generation capabilities. Mark Melchione joined us from M&T to head up the bank\u2019s New York commercial real estate group and brings more than 25 years of experience. ","Mark and his team will continue to strengthen and expand our lending and deposit gathering activities in the greater New York metro market, while maintaining the conservative and well defined underwriting philosophy that is the hallmark of People\u2019s United.","Additionally Mark Herron joined us from BB&T to become our new Chief Marketing Officer, brings more than 30 years of experience to the position. Mark will be leading all of our marketing efforts including branding, advertising, product development and digital marketing. Additionally, he will be working closely with our business lines to enhance sales force effectiveness and drive increased revenues to the bank. ","Finally, we are pleased to announce the Board voted to raise the dividend to an annual rate of $0.68 per share. This marks the 23rd consecutive year the dividend has been increased, which reflects our continued commitment to delivering value to our shareholders through the consistent return on capital. ","This concludes our presentation, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have.","Operator, we are ready for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Just wanted to touch on a couple of questions relating to the guide for 2016, starting off with net interest margin down 4 bps in the first quarter didn\u2019t see much of the asset sensitivity. Obviously as you mentioned build the securities book, just wondering are we going to be adding to that more and does that put the NIM guide at risk. Whether you are still [focused] at 285, 295? ","David Rosato","Sure Casey its David. At this point there\u2019s no change to guidance from our perspective. When I think about the margin, two things are probably important to mention. The first was the pace of securities; the growth in securities will most likely moderate over the balance of the year. We\u2019ve seen growth in the last three quarters and that pace will slow down. ","Secondly, our margin was impacted by a little over 2 basis points because of the reduced volume of loans. Had we met our loan growth expectations for the quarter, you would have seen the margin come at 285 or so. And you had mentioned the asset sensitivity, so we benefited from the increase in LIBOR which occurred prior to the Fed increase in the fourth quarter, but also we gave back some of that as the yield curve flattened in the first quarter. ","So when we think about the margin over the balance of the year, the level of short term rates as well as the steepness of the yield curve will push our margin either way a few basis points as the year unfolds. ","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Okay, makes sense, and on the expense side, Dave you mentioned it was a late winner and obviously a seasonally slow one for loan growth. But the FICA bounce for you guys historically has been 5 million to 6 million. Are you guys fully accrued on the expense side, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of why the complying was so late this quarter.","David Rosato","Yeah, we are fully accrued on the comp side or on the expense side. The milder weather was probably worth about $1 million in the quarter. The pace of hiring in the first quarter was a little slower than we expected, so that had a favorable impact, and healthcare was a positive in the quarter. As you remember in the third and fourth quarter we had a little negative surprise on the healthcare line. That helped by in the neighborhood of about $600,000.","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Jack big picture question on the M&A front, I would think with the premium multiple that you guys enjoy, you guys could structure some pretty attractive M&A deals, obviously having seen that, just wondering if you could just give us an update on that front. Are you guys out there, and if you are what kind of snags are you running in to. ","Jack Barnes","Basically very consistent with the circle comments on the subject. We certainly continue to build and maintain our relationships with folks that we like to talk to and that is ongoing. Appreciate the observation on how our stock trades and where we are and that is fully appreciated on our end. I think we just continue to look for opportunities that will make sense for us and our shareholders to build a franchise and create value. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Ramsey with FBR. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Just curios, honestly you\u2019ve touched on expenses where it looked pretty good this quarter. Is there any change as to your full year run rate guidance, remind me, I think you all had said 865 to 885. Are you on a better trajectory or at least trending to the lower end? ","David Rosato","Again, no change in guidance on the expense at this point. ","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","And then back I guess is the NIM question, so it sounds like with no change in guidance, you guys are planning on some margin expansion for more such as day to the year. How much of that if any is predicated on additional rate increases this year. I am just trying to get a sense of what the macro assumption is. ","David Rosato","So if you remember the 285, the 295 guidance back in January we laid out from a macro perspective we had built in one Fed tightening in mid-year of 25 basis points. In the first quarter we came full circle or did a round trip on Fed expectations - with the market did a round trip on Fed expectations. At this point the probability of that rate hike has probably been pushed out the end of the year by the market. But it\u2019s too early to tell from our perspective. So no change to guidance, however that original guidance did have that rate increase baked in. ","What we mentioned in the prepared remarks was the fact that, and you saw in the press release, we had 1 basis point increase in the loan portfolio, and when you look at the securities portfolio was impacted by about $1.5 million from the change in the Federal Reserve Bank dividend policy. Previously that was a 6% on Fed stock and it\u2019s come down to the 10 year treasury. ","So on a linked quarter basis that won\u2019t be there next quarter. The good news is the stabilization of loan spreads and the fact that the new business that went on in the quarter was higher than the originated loan yield. So that bodes well going forward. ","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","And then just in terms of loan growth, it sounds like most of the fullness this quarter you guys are seeing to be seasonal and still favor very good about the 6% to 8% pace for the year. ","Jack Barnes","Bob this is Jack. Yeah, we do. Again, if you look back on our history this first quarter is typically a lower. But the pace was a little slower than normal, and as David indicated earlier we expected. The good news from the story of our business mix if you will is, we had some geographies that did very well and others that were slower than usual. ","As we reflected on it, we look back at the fourth quarter, we had about 10% or 11% growth pace, so we had closed a lot of loans in December and think that some of that activity went in to the fourth quarter rather than pulled in to the first. As we kind of look forward and think about the pipelines across the businesses, we feel good about the guidance and what we will see in the quarters ahead. ","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Final question, just anything you can share with us about the Eagle Insurance acquisitions? I\u2019m not really sure how big it is or how much impact it may have. ","Jack Barnes","So as I indicated it\u2019s located in eastern Massachusetts. It\u2019s actually a very nice tie-in in to our insurance company in terms of business mix. It has some fuel and petroleum distribution expertise, which we enjoy in our company as well. We have a lot of relationships across the northeast with fuel distributors, gasoline [spotters] and on the commercial side in terms of banking relationships, and we also enjoy with those companies a lot of insurance relationships and Mike Cox, the principal in Eagle also brings that type of expertise. ","It\u2019s a little over $1 million in revenue and the principals and our company and Mike know each other. There\u2019s some very good relationship there and its really one of the key things that Mike would say that attracted him to us, is the ability to come in to the leadership and the camaraderie around our company. So we\u2019re looking forward to his positive impact. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","So in terms of the 2016 guidance you guys gave on the 4Q call, looks like you\u2019ve reconfirmed expense NIM and loan growth. All the other items that you\u2019ve provided is there any change at all to any of the guidance?","Jack Barnes","No there isn\u2019t. ","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Jack given the operating environment, how much of improvement in the efficiency ratio should we realistically expect this year? Maybe can you comment on some of the initiatives?","Jack Barnes","Well as we look at it both in terms of through the year and in to the coming years, in our planning process what we see is basically continued focus on growing revenues and kind of leveraging the opportunities that we\u2019ve created with the people that we have on the ground in the various businesses. We\u2019ll continue to grow the revenue pieces and to continue to tightly manage expenses and reduce expenses where we can. We see it gradually - slowly but gradually improving over time. So I\u2019m not going to give you a number for the end of the year, but we do see continued movement forward. ","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","Just [America] announced that they brought an efficiency expert to help, what are your thoughts on an approach like that to try and maybe get a little more momentum. ","Jack Barnes","We really spend a lot of time Steve as we\u2019ve said repeatedly in terms of focusing on managing all our expenses. We have an executive level expense management committee, EMAC that is meeting on a regular scheduled basis and on an ad-hoc basis probably close to everyday. We scrutinize every hire, every position refill if you will, replacement of folks that are leaving and we look at every contracts on a regular basis. We get ahead of those contracts as we\u2019ve described overtime. I\u2019d rather have us do that, the bankers on the ground with the understanding and the expertise of the company, then hire somebody to do it. I don\u2019t think we need to do that. ","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan","And just final one to follow-up on the commentary on M&A. Would you guys consider a deal that would take you to or even above the CCAR line. Your 40 billion of assets today and maybe talk about some of the prep work you\u2019re already doing for CCAR? Thanks. ","Jack Barnes","So we are doing prep work as we\u2019ve described before. We actually have within our PMO structure our Project Management Office a full project that looks across the requirements to cross the $50 billion mark. And kind of like I just described with the consultant right here on the expenses, we\u2019re putting time and energy in to understanding what it would mean and then attacking the work that goes in to preparing for that. ","So whether its moving from DFAS to CCAR filing or whether its writing a living will etcetera, etcetera understanding what it means, reaching out in the industry and understanding what other folks have done and we think really we\u2019ve been preparing I\u2019d say beyond, this is more than a year ago that we started this and it will continue forward with the idea that if we get to a spot where we\u2019re crossing 50, whether its naturally organically or through acquisitions that we are prepared to do that, and basically we position ourselves so that has minimal impact and obviously it will have some impact, but we\u2019ll minimize it.","Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan"," Are you there today where you would consider transaction that took above that threshold more quickly?","Jack Barnes","Yes. I would say we are not totally done but we got everything clearly insight. We\u2019ve got a lot of work done, and if it were obviously the appropriate opportunity understanding the commitment and the strategically the importance of that type of transaction, we would consider it if it were right. ","David Rosato","Just to add a little color to that Steve, we have what we call readiness reviews teams that are set after cross functional. Each team has been assigned one of the requirements that we would be subject to if we cross 50. So whether it\u2019s as Jack said, going from DFAS to CCAR or writing a living will or the broker rule, every one of those has a cross functional team that either has completed or still is in the boxes of completing the gap analysis, who then is charged with figuring out the timeline, the work structure and the expense involved to cross 50 both on an organic basis and then if we had to accelerate because we have the opportunity to do an M&A transaction. And as Jack said that process started over a year ago and we\u2019ve been slowly incrementally building that in to our run rate. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","Dave, I know you\u2019ve been through this before, but just remind us again the strategy on the security side, how you thought about it this quarter and just the build given where we are in the cycle. I just want to make sure I sort of understand what your strategy is there?","David Rosato","Sure. I can\u2019t say there\u2019s been any real change in strategy from a dollar perspective, we over the last couple of quarters we have increased the size of the securities portfolio. So it\u2019s a little bit larger as a percentage of total assets. It is less than the lower allocation than you would see across our peer group. ","So it\u2019s important to keep that in mind from our perspective. What we said last quarter was the rationale for increasing the size of the book was, we were getting concerned about the domestic economy and where our interest rates could possibly go, so we put a little bit more leverage on. And we did that to a lesser extent in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. ","From a security selection makeup of the portfolio there\u2019s really nothing that\u2019s changed. We run a very conservative fixed income portfolio from the perspective that there is the mortgaged backed securities are all 10 or 15 years mortgages rather 30. We give up yield for that, but we have more defined cash flows. We do have a municipal portfolio that we run very high, its double A plus average credit quality, its well diversified, and it provides really nice yields for us.","But there\u2019s nothing funky in that portfolio, we are not doing anything stretch for yield or anything like that. ","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of mortgage banking, how are you guys thinking about the outlook for that for the year and what type of contributor do you think that\u2019s going to be. ","Jack Barnes","Hi Collyn, this is Jack. I think the way to look at that from that way is first to think about the franchise and the growth that we\u2019ve experienced and the opportunity created and we\u2019ve had a substantial residential mortgage home equity business a long time in the franchise. But as we grew in to eastern Massachusetts and in to New York, we were under represented, right. We didn\u2019t have the people on the ground to basically generate the build the business and we\u2019ve been building that team, we referenced that probably a year ago and particularly when we bought on a new mortgage sales manager and that is beginning to bear fruit in some of the growth that we\u2019re experiencing.","So I think on the ground that\u2019s the most important thing. I\u2019ll just remind everybody we do certify mortgage folks in the branches and our company. So we do generate mortgages through our branch personnel and that\u2019s a differentiator. And we also have a wholesale operation. ","So the combination of that I think gives us the right level of business flow across the foot print and there\u2019s opportunity to keep improving that with the personnel on the ground. We looked at the year and thought that we would see, when we saw with the mortgage bankers, sat and Freddie and Fannie people expected a slower market, and we did expect some slowing, but offset by the efforts that I just described in terms of building the business.","So right now, we\u2019re seeing a decent flow of purchased activity and the recent rate changes have driven some refi\u2019s again. So our pipeline is high as its been in recent times. ","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Jack just a follow-up on your comment about sort of spotting it within just your overall growth profile in terms of geographies, where are you seeing - kind of in light of it, seems like some negative commentary we are hearing about the Connecticut economy. May be if you could just talk about the geographies where you are seeing the most promise and the ones that are struggling a little bit more. ","Jack Barnes","Sure. I think I\u2019ll start with things that have good momentum and that we certainly believe are going to move us - have moved us forward, loans that have been booked in the last several quarters including this one and where we see our pipeline strong and that would be Boston. Certainly New York and particularly on Long Island our personnel there are doing a great job across C&I and commercial real estate and those pipelines look very good. ","Our equipment finance unit particularly PCLC had a good quarter and has got a very good full pipeline. ABL pipeline is good, less volume in the first quarter but a lot of activity, and I think Connecticut was actually down in the (inaudible) portfolio in this quarter, but has been pretty steady. We have a lot of long term relationships there and we get a lot of repeat business from those customers. And on the C&I side Connecticut was okay in the quarter, but we had a couple of pay-offs that hurt our balances that came from actually companies being acquired and the acquirer just paying off our credit. ","So really, again I go back to where that comment came from. It is a mix, it always is depending on geography and business line. It definitely cycles as activity comes through the process. ","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one final question, you\u2019re mentioning equipment finance. Anything in particular driving the pickup in non-performing assets on a linked quarter in that portfolio. ","Jack Barnes","Yeah, we had a pretty granular want to say 8 to 10 credits that we went through our what we call our [PARM] or problem asset review and moved some of those credits in to non-performing. Couple of them were performing non-performing, but most of it was companies like someone that might own 10 or 25 cranes that has been deployed in different jobs where contracts were lost and they are redeploying those assets and in the meantime there\u2019s cash flow strain. And until we see those units redeployed and the cash flow back, we would put something like that on non-performing. ","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","But you still feel good about that business in general, about the growth prospects?","Jack Barnes","Yes. They are both doing very well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] our next question comes from Matthew Breese from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. ","Matthew Breese - Piper Jaffray","I was just curious, could you give us an update on new loan yield coming on to the balance sheet, which ones are accretive to the current and conversely which ones are still weighing on average loan yields?","David Rosato","In aggregate as we said the new business that came on in the quarter was higher than the originated portfolio. When we look at spreads of new business relative to the existing portfolio individually the C&I - or if you look at our major portfolios, C&I is additive at this point, primarily reflected by the Fed move last quarter and one month LIBOR moving up that\u2019s mostly uploading rate portfolio. ","Same thing would be for our HELOC portfolio. We\u2019re still not additive with the longer term fixed rate loans that are more susceptible to the shape of the yield curve, so commercial real estate is still not additive. Equipment financing is likely negative as well at this point. ABL would be additive because again it\u2019s a LIBOR portfolio. Hopefully that\u2019s helpful. ","Matthew Breese - Piper Jaffray","Yeah that is helpful. Just following up on the margin question, given that layout is what we\u2019re hearing is that if the fed were to move in mid-year and the long end of the curve stays where it is, you would expect the LIBOR based loans actually prop up the margin, lift the margin, because we didn\u2019t see it this quarter and that was a bit of a surprise. ","David Rosato","My response to Casey\u2019s first question, when we think about them margin coming in, where it did, it was primarily driven by lower loan volumes and with that comment I\u2019m not being specific to whether it was floating or fixed, it was just higher yielding asset that didn\u2019t hit the books or hit the books at a lower volume rate than expected. So that\u2019s really just the volume issue. ","When you think about our assets sensitivity, there\u2019s two components, and that\u2019s why we talk about yield curve swift and show the slide. So we try to show investors what the short end impacts are to us as well as long end. And with what happened in from mid-December or just in the last two quarters if you will is, we had benefit from rising short rates, fed funds and LIBOR. But some of that benefit was given back as the yield curve flattened.","So when we look at the balance of the year, those two components will still come in to play as well as volume. ","Matthew Breese - Piper Jaffray","And then with that could you provide us with an update on the loan pipeline today versus year-end or a year ago that gives you confidence not only that you\u2019ll hit your growth guidance but the margin can benefit as well from better loan volumes. ","Jack Barnes","Sure, its Jack. I would characterize the commercial business pipelines, obviously not all of them but generally in about the same range they\u2019ve been over the last year quarter-to-quarter. There\u2019s a couple that are up a little more substantially, but for the most part I think if you think about the whole book the pipeline flow is about inline. On residential mortgage as I just mentioned, that\u2019s up significantly and at a high point in recent times. So I hope that helps.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Incorporated. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our third quarter 2017 results are: Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let\u2019s begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. Our third quarter performance demonstrates the success of our strategy to improve earnings growth for shareholders. We reported record quarterly net income of $90.8 million, an increase of 23% from the prior year quarter and net income per common share of $0.26, up $0.02 from a year ago. The positive operating trends in the quarter reflect specific actions we have taken to enhance financial performance. We\u2019ve recently closed three successful acquisitions, made various investments in organic growth capabilities and maintain tight control of expenses.","The result of these efforts was the widening of our net interest margin, improvement in operating leverage and increases in profitability metrics. We are pleased with this progress and remain focused on executing our strategy to further enhance returns. Higher revenues and thoughtful expense control generated the third quarter efficiency ratio of 57.3%, an improvement of 110 basis points from the most recent quarter. Total revenues increased 2% on a linked quarter basis as a result of continued growth in net interest income driven primarily by further net interest margin expansion.","Expenses excluding merger related costs are up less than 1% despite closing the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital in early August. In regards to LEAF, we are very pleased with how quickly the transaction closed and how well the integration has progressed. We\u2019re excited to have such a dynamic organizations built on a multi-channel financing platform which posses leading automation, strong brand identity and outstanding talents as part of People's United family. The addition of LEAF was the primary driver of period end loan balances increasing 10% on an annualized basis from the end of the second quarter. Excluding LEAF annualized organic loan growth was 1% for the quarter. Organic growth was unfavorably impacted by lower mortgage warehouse lending line utilizations and volumes, which tend to be more volatile than our other businesses.","Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew 4% organically on an annualized basis driven by solid results in residential mortgage and middle market commercial and industrial lending. We also continue to experience good growth in our asset based landing and equipment financing businesses highlighting the importance and the impact of our diversified business mix. Our commercial real estate increased very modestly for the quarter. We remain optimistic about further growth opportunities in the fourth quarter as the pipeline is solid and we have a number of commitments ready to close.","Growth in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, payoff activity of customers choosing to sell properties, more aggressive competitions and continued runoff of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. While we are optimistic, commercial real estate is our largest portfolio and the full year growth will be influenced by fourth quarter market conditions. Period end deposits grew 9% on an annualized basis from the end of the second quarter. This increase primarily reflects continued success gathering commercial departments as well as seasonal inflows in our municipal business. Additionally deposit pricing pressure remains relatively benign in the quarter.","Finally, recently released FDIC data showed we maintained strong deposit market share in each state in which we operate and we are particularly pleased with our continued number one market share position within Fairfield County, Connecticut and the State of Vermont. Before passing the call to David to discuss the quarter in more detail, I want to highlight that during the fourth quarter People's United will celebrate its 175th anniversary.","Over this time, the company became a premium brand by understanding the value creation begins with a steadfast dedication to superior service combined with offering a full range of products. Our customer centric approach has enabled us to develop long lasting relationships that profitably fulfill client needs. This approach differentiates the franchise, enabling us to further strengthen our presence in the markets we serve.","With that, I\u2019ll pass to David.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3, net interest income of $284.6 million increased 4% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $15.2 million to the increase in net interest income due to the addition of LEAF, higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Increased borrowing costs and higher deposit costs and volumes unfavorably impacted net interest income by $3.8 million and $3.2 million respectively. Results in the third quarter were highlighted by an 8 basis point linked quarter improvement \u2013 improvement in net interest margin to 3.04, the strongest level in three years.","This expansion, as the slate on Slide 4, was driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 12 basis points as new business yields were higher than the total portfolio yield. The addition of LEAF contributed 5 basis points to the margin expansion for the quarter.","Looking at the loan portfolio on Slide 5 period end balances were $32.4 billion, an increase of $773 million or 10% annualized by the end of the second quarter mostly due to the LEAF. Commercial loans accounted for approximately $719 million of the increase while retail balances were up over $54 million. On an organic basis, loans grew 1% annualized. Solid results in residential mortgage and middle market C&I lending as well as continued growth in our asset based lending and equipment financing businesses will mostly offset by lower mortgage warehouse lending balances, which ended the quarter at $1.023 billion, a decrease of $164 million from June 30th.","As Jack referenced earlier, organic growth excluding mortgage warehouse lending was 4% annualized for the quarter underlying the importance of a diversified loan portfolio. The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations and our current view is that \u2013 is for this trend to continue in 2017. As a reminder, the updated loan growth goal of 11% to 13% we provided in July did not incorporate the acquisition of LEAF. As such with annualized loan growth excluding LEAF of 9% through nine months and Jack\u2019s earlier comments on commercial real estate achieving the lower end of our 11% to 13% goal will be challenging.","Period end deposit balances of $32.5 billion increased $733 million or 9% annualized for the quarter. The increase was primarily driven by $543 million in higher time balances resulting from a few bank wide CD campaigns during the quarter. On a business segment basis, commercial continue to benefit from franchise wise deposit gathering efforts and grew $690 million or 24% annualized for the quarter. As expected, the seasonality in our municipal business including the onboarding of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts core banking services had a favorable $634 million impact on quarter end commercial balances.","Retail balances were up $42 million, or 1% annualized. The third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits. Following historical trends, a high level of growth is expected in the fourth quarter. Moving along to Slide 7, non-interest income for the third quarter of $89.3 million decreased $2.3 million or 3% from the proceeding quarter. The decline was primarily driven by $4.5 million reduction in commercial banking lending fees resulting from lower loan prepayment income.","Net interest income was also unfavorably impacted by lower brokerage commissions and customer interest rate swap income. The largest offsets to these declines was the $2.2 million increase in insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year as well as $600,000 in higher investment management fees.","On Slide 8, we displayed the compounds driving the increase in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Included in this quarter\u2019s results, the merger related expenses of $3 million with $2.7 million of these costs residing in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. As a reminder, second quarter merger related expenses were $24.8 million of which $10.8 million were included in professional and outside services, $3.4 million in comp and benefits and $10.6 million in other.","Excluding merger related costs, noninterest expenses were $234.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million or less than 1% from the second quarter. The largest component of this increase was $1.4 million in higher costs related to compensation and benefits primarily due to the addition of LEAF. This increase was partially offset by lower professional and outside services costs of $800,000 reflecting the timing of certain projects.","We continue to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio through revenue growth and well controlled cost. As displayed on Slide 9, the efficiency ratio for the third quarter was still 57.3%, which marks an improvement of 110 basis points on a linked quarter basis and 260 basis points from a year ago. Going forward even with the significant progress we have made with our efficiency ratio, we will continue to emphasis improving our operating leverage.","Our asset quality as demonstrated on Slide 10 continues to be exceptional. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 64 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top fifty banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points remains at a very low level and continues to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets. As seen on Slide 11, return on average assets was 84 basis points and return on average tangible common equity was 11.8%, both improved from recent quarters.","We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics of the recent periods and remain focused on revenue producing initiatives to further enhance returns. Continuing on to Slide 12 as expected and discussed on last quarter\u2019s call, capital ratios declined from June 30th as a result of the LEAF acquisition. However, capital levels at both the owning company and the bank remains strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","The final Slide on Page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for additional increases in interest rates. Before opening the call up for questions, I wanted to note the effective income tax rate was 30% for the third quarter and 31% for the first nine months of 2017 compared to 31.4% for the full year of 2016. The decline is attributable to our continued investment in tax preference items.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to discuss \u2013 happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo.","Jared Shaw","Hi, good afternoon.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Jared.","David Rosato","Hi, Jared.","Jared Shaw","Okay, I just start maybe with the margin. Are you still adding to the time deposit? Is that promotion still going on? And if so, where are you seeing the pricing \u2013 I discussed the pricing preference picking some of that up? And then as we look at adding more of the LEAF balances, do you think that the margin is stable here or is that still maybe a little under pressure from here?","David Rosato","Hi, Jared. It\u2019s David. That promotion is continuing. It's actually two different CDs. It\u2019s a one year and a two year. When we think about the margin over time, first of all in this quarter we only had LEAF for two months. So, going forward, it'll be in the run rate for full quarters. A big driver is also for the last three quarters the new business going onto the balance sheet has been higher than the average portfolio yields and I am talking loans here. So we think that trend will continue. So I don't need to spend additive to our margin as we said by five basis points in the quarter for two months. So I think our margin is stable to maybe a small upward buyer over time.","Jared Shaw","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And then looking at the securities portfolio, should we expect to see you continue to make more of these investments I guess in munis and see more of the held to maturity growth or is that \u2013 or you happy with where we are at this point?","David Rosato","Our portfolio from a composition perspective and size of the balance sheet is about where we would like it. But with that said, our preference going forward is to continue to build our municipal securities portfolio. If rates fall or the yield curve flattens, we get nice protection in longer and non-mortgage backed security type investments that won\u2019t prepay us quickly, so it gives us positive convexity if rates fall and it\u2019s the best yield \u2013 yielding asset of the asset classes we\u2019re willing to put on the balance sheet and securities.","Jared Shaw","Okay, great. Thank you.","David Rosato","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","It\u2019s great. Thank you, actually a similar question just on the time deposit. Can you just talk about, I guess, the overall environment for gathering deposits because obviously you know I\u2019d love to see the money market or noninterest bearing deposits go up more than time. Like how do you guys make that decision why time versus trying to grow some of the other deposits side?","Jack Barnes","Well, the CDs, I think the primary thing to think about and look at with us on the CD promotions and that category is that we constantly have CDs maturing and many times kind of coming out of the last campaign we might have run or one we might have run a year or two or three ago. And so, we're looking to continue to maintain the balances at least at that level. And then when we have a campaign and we\u2019re getting the results we want, we make a decision of how long to run the campaign based on how active it is and whether we'd like to grow that time deposit category any further and we can stop the campaign whenever we would determine. It\u2019s actually interesting to us and I would say builds our confidence in the deposit franchise when we see that we can put campaigns out and gather retail deposits in a factored rate with a competitive interest rate. So we've been doing it regularly over the years. We look to maintain that book as I described and then decide if we want to grow it any further.","David Rosato","Ken, by no means are we not focused on noninterest bearing deposit growth that just goes without saying day in and day out.","Jack Barnes","Our primary objective on the deposit side is growing demand deposits and increasing households and growing of checking accounts. So if you want to think about it in terms of what we prioritize, it's right there. And actually, you'll see some campaigns coming out from us in that category as well.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Understood. Okay, that's helpful. And then, just a follow-up or a slightly different question. You mentioned that you're seeing a lot of payoffs in the commercial real estate side. I guess, who's the buyers of those? Do they sell the properties? Obviously, they're not refinancing with you guys. I mean, are losing the business to other banks, to cash buyers to nonbanks?","Jack Barnes","I would say on the sales side, it\u2019s really a real mix. There's a lot of different buyers in the market these days from funds to cash buyers, et cetera. So that one's a real mixed bag on that side. On the payoffs we're getting in the competitive side, that's also a mix. Very recently, we had one refinanced to Fannie Mae, which every once in a while, we get some of those with the terms and rates are just too much for our borrower to resist. We also had a large international bank take us out of a large property recently. And we have a lot of competition in the local markets from the small bank. So it also runs the gamut. That \u2013 the smaller banks, it's a bit of a mix of terms and conditions and spreads.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay, yes, it's just, you know, if that had changed or how that had changed versus the prior quarter or two?","Jack Barnes","I think the big change there is the larger non-bank player is being a little more active. It seems when we mentioned market conditions, if you ask just to point our finger at something that would probably be it.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Hey, everybody.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Steve.","David Rosato","Hi, Steve.","Steven Alexopoulos","I wanted to start first regarding being challenged at the low end of the loan growth guidance. Are you guys saying there'll be a challenge even including the $700 million plus or so of loans from LEAF even with those now will be a challenge?","Jack Barnes","No, that\u2019s not included. So we gave guidance exclusive of LEAF at that mid-year point. So we're trying to just recognize and have you realize that, the fourth quarter is very strong for us across a number of business lines, including commercial real estate. And we think we could bake the lower end of the guidance, but we wanted to recognize that it's going to be a challenge to get there. Certainly, expect if we don't, it's going to be close. But again, trying to be appropriately signaling the challenge; that's all.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay.","Jack Barnes","We \u2013 if we have the type of fourth quarter that we expect, we'll get there.","Steven Alexopoulos","Thank you. And on expenses, with all the acquisitions you guys, are just about $44 billion of assets now. Can you help us think about how much of the expenses in the run rate now for SIFI preparation? And where does that need to go over the next year?","Jack Barnes","Well, I\u2019ll take the shot at that, and I'll let David add his color. He spends a lot of time on \u2013 naturally on the CCAR pieces. And so we've been trying to lay out our B50B project, talk about the work that we have done and kind of what is baked into the run rate in terms of activity. And we feel very good about our preparation there around things like enhanced prudential standards, so all of the risk management functions in the bank and the scope of those programs and the skill sets and the people and talent that are in those groups. And that's been a substantial build over the last two or three years. So when you look at that piece of the run rate and you think of all of those units, you can feel good and confident that we feel like we're there.","If you think about broader things, like that of governance and strengthening our environment for being as certain as we can be, that the rigor around that for a larger institution, that we're ready for it, we have staffed that. We have increased the governance around it. We have purchased software to help us improve our ability to control that governance. So we've \u2013 again, that is \u2013 what I just described to you is in the run rate. And I\u2019ve mentioned, for instance, on the living will, we did research with our staff.","We realized that, okay, we understand it. We know it\u2019ll take place. We\u2019re not going to spend any money on that. So if we had to go write a living will, if and when the day comes, there would be some \u2013 but that would actually be pretty modest in the scheme of things. And then there's CCAR and the status of where we are in that preparation, and I'll let David describe some of that.","David Rosato","Thanks, Jack. And Steve, I don't have too much to add. The way I would think about it is if we compare where we are today and what we might be up against from a CCAR perspective versus a year ago, we have more \u2013 we\u2019re farther along, we have more people onboard in different areas, and that's in the run rate. So we're more prepared, certain aspects of our bank today, I would say, where we could be \u2013 or where they need to be \u2013 to be over $50 billion. But I think what's also changed is the regulatory environment, it seems a lot more favorable today than it was a year ago for many of those requirements being eased and maybe even the $50 billion line being moved.","So we're going to continue building out our capabilities around data governance and around stress testing, which is where we're really focused currently and have been for the last 12 months or so and improving processes. But there is not \u2013 there we so far maintained confidence that there's not a big uptick in expenses over the next 12 to 24 months to be ready and we think the goal posts are probably going to wind up moving on some of these standards anyway, which will be helpful to us.","And as probably worth noting, we recognize this is an important issue for everybody on the line and elsewhere. This \u2013 we have had regular dialogue, very consistent dialogue, with our primary regulator, with the OCC, on all of this preparation, the project and the details around it and where we are, and we get feedback. And we have had good contact with the Fed, both in New York and in Washington, about our continued work on being prepared and our desire to be in sync with all of our regulators as it relates to that transition.","So think of that as very consistent regular communication feedback loop and an understanding from us that we need to continue to keep moving along where we do, and I think an appreciation on their end that we are working hard to do that.","Jack Barnes","And we\u2019ve said it before, we have been stress testing semiannually now for five plus years and writing capital plans and sharing them with regulators and receiving feedback.","Steven Alexopoulos","That\u2019s very helpful color. Just one follow up, so if we assume the SIFI threshold stays constant at $50 billion, do you guys think you could keep pushing the efficiency ratio lower even as you get closer to $50 billion given all the prep work you've done already?","Jack Barnes","Yes, I would say, that\u2019s a definite yes. We've added everything that we've described to you. And so it's all about the operating leverage, right, and continuing to build and strengthen the revenues while we have managed the expenses slightly, but we've been doing that and we \u2013 you can see a good consistent progress there. And so that would be the goal.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay, thanks guys. I appreciate the color.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","Thanks guys.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Casey.","Casey Haire","So, I guess, Dave you have mentioned capital. I think you\u2019d said previously that the low 7% TCE ratio, you guys have been comfortable there. Can you just give us some updated thoughts on what your floor is? I mean, I have capital ratios kind of still in sideways from here. Are you guys comfortable there for a prolonged period of time? Or would you like to see it build? And then sort of as a follow-up, would that sort of lower capital ratio prevent you from pursuing M&A if those opportunities are still out there?","Jack Barnes","Sure, Casey. So what we \u2013 what I would say is the change in capital ratios from June 30th to September 30th were exactly as we expected and telegraphed when we announced the LEAF acquisition. We are very comfortable with our current capital levels. And our retention of capital continues to improve as the dividend payout ratio comes down. So we would not in anyway think or I would want you to think that we feel capital-constrained, number one, from running the business on an ongoing basis or from an M&A perspective.","Casey Haire","Okay, and on the M&A front, are you \u2013 I mean, you guys have done pretty well in this LEAF deal and then Suffolk as well. So I mean, are you still seeing these opportunities and having these kind of conversations?","Jack Barnes","We are certainly continuing to work on our relationships as we always are and we described to you guys. We \u2013 so in terms of finding, et cetera, I really don't have anything to say about that. And as you know, these things, dialogues happen and maybe something moves or it doesn't, but then I don't read into that. Well, I am just reaffirming that yes we do continue to look for opportunities and we do continue to build relationships.","Casey Haire","Okay, understood. And apologies if I missed this. But the transactional New York CRE book, obviously the pay downs there are muting the CRE growth. How big a book is that? I just want to get a sense on how vulnerable you are to that headwind to loan growth.","Jack Barnes","That book stands today as about $1.5 billion \u2013 $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.","Casey Haire","Great, thank you.","Jack Barnes","Casey?","Casey Haire","Yes.","Jack Barnes","Sorry, so I do think as we look at the portfolio, there are some larger multifamily loans in there. So as to the runoff there and how those relationships build over time and whether we consider them transactional relationship needs to be just thought of. We don\u2019t expect all of that \u2013 those balances to run out.","Casey Haire","You know, understood.","Jack Barnes","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Zwick with Stephens.","Erik Zwick","Good evening, guys.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Erik.","Erik Zwick","Hey, David, maybe first on the mortgage warehouse portfolio. The average loans are up in the quarter and period-end were down. And I appreciate the prior comments about those balances being volatile. But can you provide any color into what happened in the latter part of the quarter, whether it was kind of the lower utilization from just a few borrowers or whether it was a broader trend?","Jack Barnes","Yeah, I don\u2019t \u2013 in terms of a few borrowers or otherwise you\u2019re a little far away from your phone or something. So I think we got you. But \u2013 so the averages in the quarter were actually up, approximately $150 million even though ending balances were down. And just a couple of pieces of color around there. They do continue to build relationships, so they've actually \u2013 we've approved and they've booked new lines, new relationships, and that continues to move forward. But we're out of the summer home purchasing season, so that will slow activity, the refi continues to slow, and that's the volatility in that business. We're not making any assumptions about further growth or decline as we think about moving through the quarter. There's pros and cons that are impacting it.","Erik Zwick","Okay, and the Suffolk transaction closed a little over six months ago, so it\u2019s still relatively early. But can you talk about how the deal has gone so far with regard to both employee and customer retention versus your original expectations?","Jack Barnes","Yeah, glad to, it\u2019s gone very well. So probably, just some color on the retail side. We feel very good about the deposit retention. We've integrated the retail branch personnel. And I think things are settling down there very well. They are much more comfortable about the systems and products, and the meetings that we're having there with managers are really all in a very good spot. On the commercial side, we actually have increased our pipeline, especially in the business banking sector, where a lot of the commercial relationship managers came over. They\u2019re doing very well and their pipelines are growing.","And so they're focused on the next piece of business rather than transition, which we always look for and want naturally. Howard Bluver is very active with the larger customers, in particular, and involved with the dialogue there. We do have competitors that are trying to take advantage of the transition, and we feel really good about our ability to slow that down and we feel good that we have.","We've done a number of deals with old customers, existing customers where we\u2019ve used our figure balance sheet, so we\u2019ve grown some of those relationships that was part of our plan. And I would say I am very focused on making sure they're all focused at going at the competitor's customers and growing some market share and including getting myself out there to enjoy the competition.","Erik Zwick","And then lastly, on deposits. Last quarter, you talked about bringing on the state of Massachusetts as a municipal customer. Is that process complete? Or is there still more to come that could impact balances in the fourth quarter?","Jack Barnes","It basically completes. It\u2019s just one more smaller step, but I think in the scheme of things, it's hundreds of accounts and tens of agencies. And it's basically \u2013 it\u2019s all in, it's all active, and the deposit balances, on average, will \u2013 are in the numbers.","Erik Zwick","Great, thank you for taking my questions.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Breese","Good evening everybody.","Jack Barnes","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Breese","Just one quick question. What was the total balance of the LEAF loans that were acquired again?","David Rosato","$735 million.","Matthew Breese","$735 million. And so, if I back that out and kind of think about where you need them to achieve your full year guidance including Suffolk, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I would have to get something you know north of a billion dollars in net growth and it sounds like you guys are close, but it will be challenging. And so just I wanted to make sure that I had my numbers right for the fourth quarter that it will be exceptionally strong and that net growth could be north of a billion dollar, which is that accurate?","David Rosato","Yes, it is.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And do you want to \u2013 could you frame that up a little bit better if it's going to be that strong because you \u2013 color it for us a little bit.","Jack Barnes","Well, we\u2019ve given you some color on the various business lines. If we \u2013 I'd say, where some of that confidence comes from would be the strength of our commercial real estate pipeline, particularly in New York and Connecticut, although Boston has some good activity and very strong pipelines in C&I in Boston and the Massachusetts market. And I mentioned that the business banking pipeline, and particularly in New York, in the Long Island area, and the residential continues to do well.","We've been seeing declines in home equity like everyone else, so we don't see a lot of contribution there. And the equipment finance leases will be onboard for a quarter. And the other units, I would say, are facing stronger-than-average competitive pressures. The larger banks are holding a lot of larger deals some that we would traditionally get pieces of. So, that\u2019s a bit of a more uncertain piece of growth as we look forward to the fourth quarter and beyond, as we work our plans.","Matthew Breese","And what is the \u2013 if you have it, what is the blended rate of the pipeline versus the quarterly loan yields?","Jack Barnes","We don\u2019t have that.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And then looking beyond the fourth quarter, we think about your original 2017 loan growth guidance, I think it was for mid to high singles from 5% to 7% growth. In your early outlook, is that\u2019s still a good estimation of what we could see, looking over the next 12 to 18 months?","David Rosato","Matt, it\u2019s David. We\u2019re not ready to go to 2018 yet. We\u2019re just in the middle of budgeting for next year and working on our strat plans. So we'll have an update on 2018 in January.","Matthew Breese","Understood, okay. And then my last one is really just around M&A and preference. If the next deal were to come across, do you think it's more likely it would be a whole bank deal, a portfolio deal or some sort of fee income type of acquisition and what would your preference be?","Jack Barnes","The preference is to strengthen the company. So be accretive and move us forward. As we've said in the past, if \u2013 I will say banking is \u2013 feels to me like it's a lot more attractive than it was three months ago based on the regulatory environment. The regulators are trying to improve the timing, and that's been evidenced, I think, in some recent deals. So that is encouraging. But the opportunities like LEAF and in the insurance and in the wealth management business, are certainly attractive to us. And so where we have the resources and the reputation, I think, to attract discussions, and so we look for opportunities that strengthen us.","Matthew Breese","Thanks, Jack. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you for taking my questions.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks, good evening guys.","Jack Barnes","Hi.","Collyn Gilbert","David, just to go back to the \u2013 some NIM-related questions and loan yield questions. So for the last two quarters, you guys have had loan yields up, like, I guess, about 16 basis points linked-quarter, which is a really big move, probably one of the biggest I've seen, certainly, in my universe of coverage. Can you just talk a little bit more about that? And then I know you had indicated that the origination yields now have been higher than the portfolio yields for the last couple of quarters. But just break that down a little bit more as to the color that's sort of driving that. And then if there's a correlation there, specifically to obviously the move-in rates and what that's done for loan yields and maybe what you're thinking about in terms of the NIM trajectory as we look out over the next quarter and then into next year, given the potential Fed move.","David Rosato","Sure, for a couple of years, what I would say is rates were falling and spreads were compressing. And so since the last year, we've had Fed funds go up a 100 basis points, and you really had a stabilization of spreads, so you \u2013 we had a reversal of two \u2013 of the two major drivers, right? The interest rate rising rather than falling and spreads stabilizing rather than continuing to compress. The \u2013 about 43% or so of our loan book is floating, so we've clearly benefited from LIBOR being up about 100 basis points over that time frame and it's really just that. The combination of those two things on a $32 billion loan book, I would say, only about 43% of it is prime or LIBOR-based. But that's very powerful, and that's really all it is that\u2019s been helping us.","Jack Barnes","Just one a little bit additional color there, that one of the things we've been doing is really looking hard at our mix and the contributions of that, right? And so you remember, we had started backing away from that New York multifamily, and that wasn't a quality issue, it was a yield issue and where the spreads were compressing too. So as that runs off, our entire commercial real estate book is looking better and contributing better. And in the residential area, we're trying hard to attract activity in the products that are giving us better return as well. So the big things are what David just talked about, we are trying to work around the edges as well and keep that moving in the right direction.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the provision, I know, you had indicated it would be contingent upon mix and quality and all that type of thing, but are you still thinking that the provision could kind of fall in that $25 million range for the full year this year? And then maybe, I know you're not giving guidance, David, next year, but I'm just trying to think about how you're thinking about the outlook for credit and maybe where you would be building the reserve or where you maybe would be releasing the reserve or just how you're thinking about it altogether.","David Rosato","Yeah, when you think about the $25 million to $35 million guidance, we put out, if current trends continue, which is what we would expect, we'll probably be at the lower end of that guidance range for this year. The caveat to that is clearly the loan growth over the balance of the year. But as far as charge-offs, we\u2019ve been in a very nice place and very steady for quite a few quarters now. So I'd say, from a guidance perspective, on the good side of that guidance.","Jack Barnes","Collyn, I think from our perspective, the credit outlook is basically the same, and we're not immune from customers going through challenges. I think we're very good at working with customers and very good at underwriting, so that it's \u2013 the numbers come out consistently where they do. And I don't see any big shift in the credit environment that would cause us concern at all.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one final question. I know it\u2019s hard to predict obviously that \u2013 this kind of the swap income and just that other income line. I mean you've seen it go as high as, I guess, $30 million in the first quarter and this quarter was low of $13.7 million, all in. Is there any \u2013 just it's a big number that swings quite a bit and then makes it a little bit hard to project. Is there any way we could think about it maybe qualitatively for the direction of that line item?","David Rosato","Well, you started the question with the swap income, right? And yes, that's really, in large part, driven by commercial real estate origination activity. So that was a little light in the quarter. The origination activity as we\u2019ve talking about was soft, and it impacts that line. The other \u2013 I would actually say, from my perspective, it \u2013 there historically has been some lumpiness in that, but it's really settled down. And you look at second to third quarter, this quarter, and there's a $0.5 million differential. So I would expect that to continue going forward more muted changes.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay, all right. Thanks. I will leave it there.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","David Rosato","Well.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, with no further questions in queue, I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, we\u2019re pleased with the company's strong performance in the quarter, which was highlighted by the successful closing and integration of the lead commercial capital transaction, record quarterly net income, further expansion and net interest margin to its highest level and three years, ongoing improvement in operating leverage, driven by revenue growth and tight expense control, strong deposit growth and exceptional asset quality. As we celebrate our 175th anniversary, our commitment to building a strong banking franchise for the long-term remains unwavering. And we are confident in our ability to deliver superior service to clients and consistent quality earnings growth to shareholders. Thank you for your interest in People's United.

My name is Jenison, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc, please proceed sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes; Kirk Walters; David Rosato; and Jeff Hoyt are here with me to review our second quarter results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our Web site, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. As always we appreciate you joining us today. This quarter\u2019s results reflect the core strengths of our franchise. The benefit of investments we continue to make in people, products and services, as well as our expanded geographic footprint. These investments helped total revenue growth by $3 million over the prior year period. This is in spite of net interest margin pressure and residential mortgage gain on sale headwinds. Even with these important investments and revenue initiatives and higher cost of regulatory compliance, we continue to hold operating expenses flat through a process of effective expense management.","Now I\u2019d like to discuss our third quarter results. On Slide 2, operating earnings were $63 million, while net income was $61.6 million both equating to $0.21 per share. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased to $233.3 million, which represents 2% growth over the prior year period. The net interest margin declined by 8 basis points to 305 compared to 313 in the second quarter of 2014.","End of period loans grew at an annualized rate of 8% in the third quarter. This marks our 16th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and customers. Our growth is founded on customer relationships which have expanded as we have added talent, product capabilities and deepened our presence in the large markets of Metro New York and Greater Boston.","Total deposits grew at a 19% annualized rate which was largely attributable to a $900 million increase in brokered deposits. Excluding brokered deposits, organic deposit growth was 5%, as we further strengthen relationships in the larger New York and Boston markets, our deposit base will be set for growth. Our commercial relationship managers have deposit gathering as one of their top goals. This approach is consistent with our long held preference for relationship-based banking on both sides of the balance sheet. And what is a seasonally strong quarter, non-interest income was $4.5 million ahead of the second quarter at $84 million.","Operating expenses remained flat at $206.7 million as a result of disciplined expense control. Efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 61.4% from 61.8% in the second quarter of 2014, due to both revenue expansion and careful expense management. Asset quality remained strong with net charge-offs of 30 basis points and non-performing loans of 92 basis points. As mentioned before, we firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow a balance sheet.","With that I\u2019ll pass it to David and Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3 we provide detail behind the linked quarter change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Runoff in the acquired loan portfolio resulted in declines in accretion of 2.8 million. Lower yields offset growth within the investment portfolio, negatively impacting net interest income by 400,000. Borrowing cost increased 1.3 million following the subordinated debt transaction in the second quarter. While increased deposit volume negatively impacted net interest income by 300,000. This was offset by strong originated loan growth and one more calendar day in the third quarter, which positively impacted net interest income by 3.5 million and 1.8 million respectively. As we have mentioned before, growth in net interest income from the originated portfolio outpacing lost accretion on the acquired portfolio is a positive sign for the quarters ahead.","On Slide 4 you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our quarterly net interest margin results. New loan volume and mix negatively impacted the margin by 6 basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. The subordinated debt issuance contributed 2 basis points to the net interest margin decline, while lower security yields and deposit volume each pressured the margin by 1 basis point. An additional calendar day in the quarter positively impacted the margin by 2 basis points. More broadly, benchmark interest rates and credit spreads are lower than at the beginning of the year. Our continued strong loan growth in this environment has resulted in more net interest margin pressure than we have anticipated.","Slide 5 give provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew 499 million or 8% annualized. This was achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint, as well as our progress in our heritage markets. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled 597 million, as in prior quarters growth was well balanced from a product and geographic perspective. Commercial real-estate contributed 161 million of the total originated loan growth, while C&I contributed 208 million. Within C&I, we saw particular strength in our equipment finance and asset based lending businesses. These business units have recently demonstrated meaningful productivity increases.","The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. Residential mortgages contributed 198 million of originated loan growth in the third quarter. Net of acquired loan runoff, the residential mortgage portfolio grew at an annualized rate of 17%, reflecting strong demand for jumbo hybrid ARM portfolio products all within our markets.","The consumer portfolio contributed 30 million to originated loan growth, which was driven by higher home equity advances in the third quarter. It is important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail originated with approximately 63% of third quarter originations in a first-lien position which is slightly above the range we have experienced over the last three years We experienced acquired loan runoff of 98 million this quarter compared to 133 million in the second quarter and 220 million in the third quarter of 2013. We anticipate runoff in all of our loan portfolios including our acquired loan portfolio to remain at low levels. Slower runoff is expected to contribute to continued healthy loan growth.","You can see on Slide 6 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Total deposits increased 1.2 billion supported by brokered deposit growth of 900 million. The seasonality in our municipal business had a favorable $247 million impact on commercial deposits in the third quarter. The third quarter represents a seasonal low point for customer retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter. As alluded to earlier, we believe we are underway commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasize deposit gathering. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of the customer relationship and our ongoing focus remains on growing organic deposits and improving our deposit mix.","Now I would like to pass it to Kirk.","Kirk Walters","","Thank you, David. On Slide 7 we take a closer look at non-interest income which performed well in the third quarter. The seasonal nature of insurance renewals benefited fee income by 2 million. Commercial banking\u2019s lending fees increased 1.2 million which was mostly driven by loan prepayment and commercial lending services fees. Gain on residential mortgage sales increased 1.1 million, while bank service charges increased 500,000 due to higher overdraft and interchange fees. Customer interest rate swaps decreased 400,000.","On Slide 8 we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expense. As we have mentioned before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost to compliance. Non-operating expenses increased 500,000 which is attributable to branch closure and severance related costs. From an operating expense perspective professional and outside services decreased 600,000 which is partially offset by the timing of advertising expenses of 400,000. Importantly the net impact was a flat operating expense for the quarter. The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last five quarters. As I mentioned earlier the efficiency ratio improved this quarter as a result of revenue growth and disciplined expense management. We continue to remain very focused on improving operating leverage.","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 92 basis points remains well below our peer group and top-50 banks and are down approximately 27% from 1.26% in the third quarter 2013. Acquired non-performing loans are not included in these calculations due to the different accounting model applicable to such loans. However, it is worth noting that we are very pleased with their performance as we have seen these balances decline 38 million or 25% to 116 million in the current quarter from 154 million a year ago.","Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs continue to remain low at 13 basis points compared to 10 basis points last quarter and 17 basis points one year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge-offs, net charge-offs this quarter were 12 basis points. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets and are well below peers. Over the last four quarters charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 58% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand their credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","Now I\u2019ll pass it back to Jack.","Jack Barnes","","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 15% and 17% respectively.","Operating return on average assets for the third quarter was 74 basis points compared to 72 basis points for the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra-low interest rate environment and some recent initiatives which we are still ramping up to a more normal level of productivity. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income growth and a continued disciplined approach to expenses. Slide 14 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity since the third quarter of 2013. We expect to see continued progress on this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital.","Now I\u2019ll pass it back to David to discuss our capital ratios and interest rate risk profile.","David Rosato","","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 15 we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained solid with our tangible common equity ratio at 7.8%, Tier 1 common at 9.9% and total risk-based capital at 12.3%.","Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we are a bit more asset sensitive this quarter as compared to last particularly in the yield curve twist scenario of short end up 100 basis points. The primary reasons for the change relates to our originating more C&I loans, which tend to LIBOR based and the building of a brokered CD book with terms ranging from three months to five years with the current average maturity of nine months.","Now I\u2019ll pass it back to Jack to wrap-up.","Jack Barnes","","Thanks David. Our franchise founded on deep commitment to exceptional customer experience as well as a continuously improving set of talent and capabilities is well position for growth. Along the way we\u2019re building the business the right way, the only way for long-term. With that in mind we intend to submit within the next few days an application to the office of the control of the currency to convert People\u2019s United Bank to a national bank charter from its current federal savings bank charter. Concurrently we intend to file an application with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for a bank holding company status. We believe this conversion will better match our commercial banking business model.","Further, we will benefit from both the OCC and the Federal Reserve\u2019s deep understanding of and experience in supervising large commercially oriented financial institutions. This concludes our presentation.","Now we\u2019d be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale with Janney, please proceed.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","","Hi, thank you. First question really relates to your growth on the commercial loan side and you talked about this in your comments the mix of more maybe equipment finance and ABL loans, but I was trying to reconcile that to the decline in your average yields it seemed like a fairly steep decline about 12 basis points sequentially. So was that decline largely attributable to a mix shift given have the equipment finance and asset based loan originations, can you give us a sense for how much of the sequential growth came from pure C&I versus equipment financed loans that would be helpful.","David Rosato","","Sure Sameer it\u2019s David. It was actually a combination of both. We did see continued spread pressure during the quarter. Generally speaking across all of our portfolios and then we did also have a mix change. The net effect was about half and half between spread change and mix change.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thanks David. And then the other question I had was just expectations from the standpoint of provisioning, the loss provision is a little bit higher compared to what you\u2019ve been reporting I think over the last few quarters and I wanted to get a sense for whether you think, you expect provisioning to come back down a little bit, I know there is some provisioning for growth but how should we think about that looking out the next few quarters?","Jack Barnes","","Hi, Jack. I would answer that in two ways I mean we are very consistently as we have move through the last number of years approaching the provisioning in two different ways one is to deal with covering charge-offs net of specifics if we have them laid out. The other is dealing with loan growth. So, we\u2019ve been provisioning within a pretty consistent range I would say, this quarter we had one particular credit that we dealt with in the charge-off side but, so depending on we don\u2019t expect any major changes in kind of asset quality metrics or charge-off levels within the range we\u2019ve been in is what we\u2019d expect and naturally based on loan growth and mix again we would be provisioning for the growth.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, just my last question was really on your dividend policy I mean when you look at the valuation of the shares relative to the dividend yield obviously it seems fairly high and yet gradually it seems like the dividend per share has been creeping up. I understand that that\u2019s gradually but at what point do you say clearly the stock on a dividend yield basis seems to be yielding a pretty rich yield. So maybe we should just hold off a little bit on increasing dividends going forward, how do you think about that?","Jack Barnes","","Well, again I would reference you to the last number of periods we generally like the idea of being able to continue to increase the dividend very much in the same manner we have in prior years and we\u2019re very focused on improving profitability which will bring the dividend payout ratio down as it has been doing gradually overtime.","David Rosato","","Yes Sameer, the dividend increase history that we\u2019ve had is a penny per year on our share count equates to $3 million per annum and our plan is definitely to have loan growth or have earnings growth outpace the dividend increase so that you will continue to see our a trend down in our dividend payout ratio.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Jack Barnes","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW, please proceed.","Collyn Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","","Great, thanks. Good afternoon guys. Jack, if I could just follow-up or maybe actually David might have made that comment or nevertheless, just a comment that you guys made at the beginning where just saying that the strong loan growth created more NIM pressure than you anticipated, what exactly do you mean by that?","Jack Barnes","","Well, you\u2019ve seen the our NIM come down each quarter this year and when you look at the drivers of that its benchmark interest rates so, 10 year treasury for example is down 90 basis points on the year and 5 year notes are down about 40 basis points. And then those being continued competitive pressure on spread. We are doing our best to pick our spots for loan business and we have a lot of different portfolios, so we\u2019re trying to grow where there is less competition. But the statement was just around the fact that, as the year is unfolded, it\u2019s become a tougher environment than what we thought at the beginning of the year.","Collyn Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I mean, are you thinking about when you thinking about that the balance sheet in totality and the profitability profile that you will balance it such that you will continue to grow with it just as you continue to grow NII?","Jack Barnes","Yes, I mean basically, I think one of the great advantages that we have from an operating aspect was that run the number of businesses that we do run and if you look back at that 16 quarters of loan growth now and that\u2019s a pretty consistent demonstrating a consistent ability to move all of the businesses forward. We feel very good that we will be able to continue to do that and that that will allow us to continue to grow net interest income as we move forward.","Collyn Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then just a question on the brokered deposit, I think so you guys you have grown I think you said 900 million, I think last quarter you were targeting more like $700 million level, what\u2019s driving that difference and do you expect to sort of continue to pace of growth ahead of where you maybe originally would have anticipated?","Jack Barnes","I think the pace of growth will subside a little bit. We did a little bit more in the third quarter than we thought we would. Really what\u2019s new there is we started to build a CD portfolio which we mentioned in the script, so we\u2019re starting to term out a little bit a CDs just provide liquidity prior to needing the fund loan growth.","Collyn Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay that\u2019s helpful, and then just one final question, any change in your positioning on M&A in terms pursuing potential targets?","Jack Barnes","No, there is no change, I would say we continue to work at it as we have and work our relationships and it might feel like the environment is changing a little bit, but not dramatically from our perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Darst with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","David, could you talk about your target capital ratios and I guess you\u2019ve grown the balance 10% year-over-year, but it looks like you\u2019ve retained earnings growth and probably supports only middle single-digit lowering balance sheet growth going forward and I just wanted know how you\u2019re planning for it?","David Rosato","Well, our capital ratios have come down, but I would say only moderately. If you look from the second to the third quarter, we are slightly above our, what we would call our operating targets and we believe that we do have the ability to continue to grow the balance sheet. However, we would expect loan growth will probably slow a little; it\u2019s just the law of large numbers as we get bigger and are not concerned about having the capital to fund that growth.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Okay, got it, and then you talked about your organic commercial deposit strategy, could you maybe outline how you\u2019re approaching that and maybe in what markets that you\u2019re doing it?","Jack Barnes","Sure, this is Jack, David. The primary focus is on cross-sell and good fundamental banking. We have always had an expectation that we would gather deposits from commercial relationships. What we\u2019ve done in the last several years as we have intensified that focus through changes that we have made in incentive programs and also frankly just toned from the top management focus and another critical component that\u2019s helping us a lot, in kind of execution of those expectations as we review relationships for credit events, and outside of credit events we\u2019re reviewing customer profitability and return on capital measures. And it really highlights the importance for our relationship managers to gather deposits from their customers and increase the other percentage of deposits that we have already. So there is a lot more focus and a lot more ask going on, on the deposit side which is giving us some good results.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","So is that rooted in some of your comments where you talk about your needing the backfill into some of your markets to get more relationships that you maybe did not have a number of years ago?","Jack Barnes","Yes, I would say in different pieces of our footprint and legacy some have been stronger than others overtime. Business we\u2019re all doing quite well and making progress. The other thing that I think is really important for people to think about with us is if you look at our presence in New York and Boston, the branches that we acquired from Smithtown and citizens in New York were barely small underperforming. And we\u2019ve been building those out steadily and there is, in New York there was just under a 100. So that creates a lot of opportunity for us to generate new deposits and strengthen our deposit growth rates. And Boston is very much the same thing, it went through a different kind of transition after the acquisitions that were completed in 2012 and we have been moving forward on retail and commercial in the Greater Boston area with deposit gathering as well. So there is a lot of just good solid banking in the new markets that will result in good deposit generation.","Operator","","And your next question comes from Matthew Kelley with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee & Leach ","","Hi, I was looking at slide 20. You give a nice table reconciling the reported versus the core margin. The core margin is 298 now. In the current interest-rate environment, where would you see that over the next year, assuming no changes in the rate environment or Fed funds policy? ","","David Rosato","","Hi, Matt its David. It's the $1 million question, if we look back on this year we have our new business yields at the beginning of the year were above our originated portfolio, and then they have fallen behind -- and then they been above and below the originated portfolio. So, we believe that there is still more margin pressure, there is more forces on the margin to take it down rather than to take it up, that\u2019s a combination of competitiveness, some other lenders as well as the interest environment. So, it's a little too early, we believe to put that, out a number out there, we\u2019re in the middle of our planning process for next year, but suffice it to say we\u2019re doing it everything we can to manage our business to preserve margin while still working to maintain an asset stand to their position. So hopefully that\u2019s helpful.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee & Leach ","Okay, okay. Then the brokered deposit strategy, how much more is that going to continue over the next couple quarters? And ultimately, where do you see your loan-to-deposit ratio next year? ","David Rosato","Well, I\u2019ll start with the latter. So you saw our loan-to-deposit ratio at the end of this quarter was 102 when it come down I believe from 105 at the end of the second quarter, we certainly like that direction. Ultimately, we want a loan-to-deposit ratio of around a 100%. And the efforts that we have in the commercial bank to get our whole share of deposits in those markets will help us achieve that. In the short-term there will be growth, continued growth broker deposits but I would think the pace will subside.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee & Leach ","Okay. And last one, 35% tax rate still we should be using through next year?","David Rosato","Probably 34.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee & Leach ","Okay, got it. Okay. Actually, one last question, if I could. What are your current rates for that core 5\/1 multi-family product in the New York market? I know that's been a big driver of growth over the last year or two for you folks. Where are you right now on pricing and what are your thoughts on that business?","Jack Barnes","Jack, first of all more broadly on the business, we have seen spread compression come in during the year here pretty meaningfully and I think we talked about it at one of the conferences recently that we, we were slowing our pace of growth in that portfolio because of where spreads are going. So, we are committed to the business, we\u2019re committed to working with the quality sponsors. But that said we are not going to kind of grow the portfolio with these spreads at the rate we have been anticipating. So, we are slowing our participation but we are going to stay in the game for the long-term. And just in terms of we talk about spreads and we\u2019ve definitely seen probably between 25 basis points and 50 basis points compression during the year.","David Rosato","Yeah, that current spreads in the five year about 150 to 160 over swaps. And as Jack said that\u2019s getting tight. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR please proceed.","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","","I appreciate you taking the questions. To follow up on Matt's question about margin, I can appreciate you all are still in the planning process for next year, but do you have a sense of what compression could look like in the fourth quarter, based on your loan pipeline, and do you think you will still be able to stay above the 3.10% guidance you all have previously given?","David Rosato","","Hey Bob its David. As you know the guidance at the beginning of the year was 3.10% to 3.20%. Year-to-date that margin is 3.12% and it was 3.05% in the third quarter. So we would think that we would be at the low-end of that guidance the very low-end of that guidance. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","","That suggests that you're going to have, I guess, a more moderate pace of compression in the fourth quarter than the third?","David Rosato","","We are trying to achieve. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay.","Jack Barnes","","That given the last few days in the market. Right?","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Yes, it changes every day, right?","Jack Barnes","","One thing is important to remember Bob is as Kirk gave. For the third quarter. We had a four quarter interest expense on this coordinated debt to third quarter and that was issued right at the end of the second quarter. So I was thinking about linked quarter compression that\u2019s already reflected in numbers. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Remind me; was that a couple basis points of -- 1 to 2 basis points of drag in the third quarter from the debt? ","Jack Barnes","","There was 2.","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","","2, okay, great. Talking about -- you all were asked about growth in capital earlier and you said you do expect growth to slow, and you have talked, too, about the competitive environment in multi-family and narrower spreads. Just curious, as you expect growth to slow -- I think you all talked about the law of large numbers, is that a 2015 event or is it a longer-term event when you start to see the pace of loan growth slow?","Jack Barnes","","2015. And I would say we are looking out that far. What the point is that as we have grown out things like ABL mortgage warehouse, mid-corporate portfolios. Even Long Island C&I and the things that we have been referencing for a couple of years as they get to more kind of normal growth rate that would come from just hitting $0.5 billion or $1 billion in size the ability to add business in those new platforms that at the pace we have been this logically doesn\u2019t make sense when the numbers get larger. So that\u2019s what we mean by the comment that\u2019s made. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","","Okay. You had also mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks that you have applied to change charters. Remind me, because I think you all went through this process once before and then withdrew the charter application. Could you just give me maybe a little bit of background about -- remind me what happened then and talk about what's different about the application now or why you see it progressing differently?","Jack Barnes","","Well it\u2019s I would say pretty straight forward. We have had the OCC and Fed as our primary regulators and over the last number of years as the Thrift and OTS went away. And we have been going through an evaluation of which direction should we go, which is basically national charter or state. And as we have built a relationship with the OCC over that period of time and we both have gotten to know each other very well. It makes good sense for us to go into the national charter and to continue on with the relationship where we are not starting from scratch. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, and then, what's different this time than the last time that you all, I guess, had applied to change charter? Or had applied for an OCC charter?","Jack Barnes","","I know the comments I just made about understanding the regulator much better having built the relationship over that period of time and the benefits of the national charter. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets","","Okay, great. Last question and I will hop out. You all had a good quarter for fee income. I think last quarter you all had said that the goal was to hold fee income flat year over year, and just curious, with one quarter left to go, how you all are thinking about the opportunity to hold fee income flat?","David Rosato","","Hi, Bob its David. Once again we are doing everything we can across each of our lines of business. Each of our fee income businesses. We have good traction in our wealth management business, our cash management business. We did see a positive change in our gain on sale line however it\u2019s substantially down year-over-year and continues to provide one of the larger headwinds. We\u2019re hoping we get a little pick up in the fourth quarter on that line item with what\u2019s going on in the interest rate market.","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets.","","Sure.","David Rosato","","That\u2019s from the last couple of days we start to see a little switch in application volume where refinances are starting to come back a little bit it\u2019s early it\u2019s only been two weeks that grades are really starting to fall but we\u2019re pulling all the levels that we have to hold the line on fee income.","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets.","","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Casey Haire - Jefferies ","","Hi good afternoon guys.","Jack Barnes","","Hi Casey.","Casey Haire - Jefferies","One of the follow up on the capital adequacy question if I may I just said another way, the TCE ratio at 7.8 at what level would you not like to see that TCE going lower?","Jack Barnes","","Well, we think we can, for the risk of our business model which we figure is, which we believe is very low risk especially based on the credit performance that we put in. We can operate in the 7.5% range for TCE the tangible assets.","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Okay. When you see that is to getting ratio for you or what would be Tier 1 leverage?","Jack Barnes","","It\u2019s probably TCE if there was one.","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Okay.","Jack Barnes","","That\u2019s a range, that\u2019s not a absolute floor we\u2019re not saying it would never go below 7.5% but right around 7.5% which was to my earlier statement we\u2019re a little above where we think we will be long term. ","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Understood, okay. And then just a question on slide 16, the NII sensitivity to be up 200 bps shock. Can you just go over some of the assumptions there? It obviously screens very well versus peers, but it just seems aggressive, given if I strip out the broker deposits, the loan-to-deposit ratio, if my math is right, it\u2019s over 110%. So if you could just go through some of the assumptions that gets you that kind of lift, specifically around the broker deposits?","Jack Barnes","","From a broker deposit perspective we assume that any money market broker deposits are going to go up basis point by basis point with any change in the fed funds right. So a 100% elasticity to rising rates. Within the broker deposit the broker CDs would have a slight lag because on the prepared comments we said that there is a -- we\u2019re doing CDs from three months from five years and currently that look as a nine month weighted average. So there was a little lag effect there. Our balance sheet has been changing as we\u2019ve been doing less fixed rate multifamily and less fixed rate commercial real estate and doing more C&I and also not to the same extend we\u2019re doing a little more in key logs. We have been able to grow that portfolio slightly that\u2019s the prime based portfolio most of the C&I is one month LIBOR base.","So our assets, the asset side of the balance sheet has got more sensitive to rising rates than where it was for example six months ago or a year-over-year. A big driver in all models is your assumptions around deposits and we spent a lot of time on deposit assumptions. We have elasticity, that ranges anywhere from 15% up through 75% meaning up a 100 some deposits for example non-interest or interest bearing checking account may only for a very lower tier balance account they only go up 15 basis points but a retail CD will go up 75 basis points if any market move.","So when you put all that together still a strong core retail and commercial deposit base and more assets that are LIBOR based as well as a very short highly cash flow and securities portfolio that is only 13% to 13.5% of total assets significantly below our peer group that\u2019s what creates this asset sensitivity. ","Casey Haire - Jefferies","Understood. Thank you.","Jack Barnes","","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst ","","Hi its Cardy Bott [ph] on for Ken Bruce. Just looking at the tax rate in the quarter, it looks like it was a little bit lower than what we were looking for. I guess last couple of quarters; it was running closer to 35%. Was there something driving that?","Kirk Walters","","I will take that one it\u2019s Kirk. Typically in the third quarter we threw up our caps rates I think lot of institutions to it\u2019s the a raw level of income coming in we probably do have a little higher amount of municipal securities and IRBs and such than originally was billed into the rate I think to one of the earlier questions looking forward and thinking about this year we\u2019ll probably turn into right around the 34% all in rate for the year.","Unidentified Analyst","","Okay, thanks. And I guess just looking at expenses, it seems like you guys are still ramping up some initiatives, but at the same time, we are talking about growth potentially slowing. Just wondering how we should think about just the current -- the expense run rate over the next couple quarters. We are looking at, I think, $208 million right now. Is that kind of a good run rate?","Jack Barnes","","Yes, on an operating basis we\u2019re drawn $205 million to $207 million where $206.5 million I believe this quarter other than ramp up in the first quarter because of benefits, employee compensation benefits we think our run rate is right in this range.","Unidentified Analyst ","","Alright, thank you.","Jack Barnes","","And I would just add, we work hard to keep it in this range.","Unidentified Analyst ","","Sure, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore, please proceed.","John Pancari - Evercore","","Could you give us -- I appreciate you giving us the new money loan yields for the multi-family business, and can you give us the similar new money spreads or yields for the non-multi-family commercial real estate, as well as for C&I, just to get an idea of how the competitive pressure is impacting the spreads? Thanks.","Jack Barnes","","So for non-multifamily commercial real estate we\u2019re actually see much better spreads you see spreads in the call it 2.15 to 2.25 range. And for middle -- what we call middle market C&I, you\u2019ll see spreads between call it two in a quarter to 2.5.","John Pancari - Evercore ","Okay. Do you have what they were last quarter, so we can get an idea of how they are trending, those spreads?","Jack Barnes","","Generally speaking I would say those spreads are down about 10 basis points if I have to pick a number, about 10 basis points.","John Pancari - Evercore ","Okay. All right, that's helpful. Then, simply, sorry if this was already asked, but you indicated that in your prepared comments and in your press release that you are seeing some elevated regulatory and compliance spending, as I am sure -- obviously, as a lot of other banks are, as well. But can you help us quantify where those costs are currently on an annualized basis and what your outlook is for 2015 for those costs?","Jack Barnes","","Sure, this is Jack. So we haven\u2019t been specific with exactly where all the regulatory cost are frankly there the organization over the last number of years has been absorbing additional cost in many different ways. Some very direct things like building out compliance cost or risk staff other is more indirect like dealing with the operational impact of different expectations and having to absorb changes and process and unlike. So, it\u2019s not the kind of number that\u2019s easily grab the hold of them and not something we\u2019ve been sharing our sense of.","John Pancari - Evercore ","Okay. Okay. Lastly, in terms of the other category in the expense bucket, I just wanted to get some color on what drove the increase in the third quarter in that line item. ","Kirk Walters","","Hey John, it\u2019s Kirk, how are you?","John Pancari - Evercore ","Good.","Kirk Walters","Really if you look at it second quarter was abnormally low if you look at sort of the linked quarters and page 10 of our press release in the second quarter we did have its bits and pieces but we did have a gain on a brands that we closed and sold and a few other things. So when you look at this quarter and then you look back at the other linked quarter this is pretty well and average quarter for us.","John Pancari - Evercore ","Okay, thank you Kirk and thanks guys.","Kirk Walters","","Thank you.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from Matthew Kelley with Sterne, Agee, please proceed.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee ","","Yes, just a quick follow-up, if you are pulling back a little bit on the multi-family commercial real estate because you are a little concerned on the spreads and it's getting thin there, would you consider adding more in the security side or adding more in the jumbo mortgage side? Give us a sense on what the yields are in those departments if you decided to maybe add a little bit more of those types of earning assets instead?","David Rosato","Hey, Matt, it\u2019s David. It\u2019s a great question with what\u2019s going on in the bond market, we\u2019re not really inclined to put securities on at these levels. So that\u2019s as you know we tend to run a smaller securities portfolio than the peer group, so we don\u2019t necessarily see securities growing in as a percentage of total assets. On the residential mortgage side, we did have good solid growth last quarter and as you know the only thing that with portfolio our arms 51s, 71s, and 101s. Our sense is that customer demand will continue to be there. I think we will add to that asset class and spreads there are going to hold up better than on the security side, so of the two I would expect to see in residential mortgages.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee ","Okay, thank you.","Jack Barnes","I will just add, again, just thinking about all of the businesses we\u2019re in, we had better spreads certainly than not the family and things like equipment finance lending, mortgage warehouse lending, business banking are small business portfolios across our footprints. So what we\u2019re looking to do would emphasize those businesses where we do have a healthier spread and move focus on growing those portfolios as an alternative.","David Rosato","And to Jack\u2019s point, the fourth quarter does tend to be a good quarter for us form a C&I perspective as well.","Matthew Kelley - Sterne, Agee ","Along those lines, what was the mortgage warehouse balance and any commentary, just what you're seeing more recently here with the plunge in treasury rates? ","Jack Barnes","Well, the mortgage warehouse balance was that was $700,000 million at the end of the quarter, which I think at June it was 708. So it was really unchanged on the quarter. With assuming these lower rates hold, I would expect to see mortgage broker volumes pick up and if we did see that relate to larger balances in our mortgage warehouse and we would expect that.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in queue, I will now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remark.","Peter Goulding","Thank you again for joining us today.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator instructions] I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you, Amanda. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our third quarter of 2015 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Senior Executive Vice President; and Jeff Hoyt, our Controller.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today.","Results for this quarter reflect our unwavering commitment to further improve profitability, which remains our most important objective. While we are proud of our accomplishments over recent years, particularly given the persistently low interest rate environment, we must continue to drive forward to further execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our large and attractive markets.","Given the breadth of our products and services we provide, the exceptional talent we continue to attract and our strong focus on relationship banking, we are confident in our ability to deliver consistent quality earnings growth for our shareholders.","Now, turning to the overview of the third quarter on Slide 2. Operating earnings of $68.4 million or $0.23 per share represent a 9% increase from the prior-year quarter or a 10% increase on a per share basis. Revenues increased 3% on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, driven by higher net interest income and higher fee revenues.","It is important to note, the pace of net interest margin decline continued to moderate in the third quarter. Net interest margin was 2.87%, a decrease of only 1 basis point from the second quarter.","Expenses were up modestly on both a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis, primarily reflecting higher compensations and benefits costs. However, we remain confident in our ability to control cost, despite the ongoing impact of strategic investments and higher regulatory compliance cost.","Loans grew for the 20th consecutive quarter, although the 2% annualized growth rate is a slower pace than recent quarters. The portfolio was primarily impacted by lower line utilizations and volumes within our mortgage warehouse lending business.","Loan outstandings within this business tend to be more volatile than our other businesses. Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, loans grew over 6% on an annualized basis, driven by strong residential mortgage and commercial real estate results, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix.","Our progress gathering deposits continued during the quarter, as evidenced by annualized growth of 12% from the end of the second quarter. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, the deposit base will continue to see growth.","Recently released FDIC data show we either increased or maintained our deposit market share rank in each state we operate in. And we are particularly pleased with our continued number one market share position within the Fairfield County, Connecticut and the State of Vermont.","With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, we provide detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income from the second quarter. Our ongoing loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio, each increased net interest income by $2.2 million.","Net interest income also increased $1.7 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. The largest offset to these improvements was a $1 million reduction in net interest income, due to a decline in accretion from run-off in the acquired loan portfolio.","On Slide 4, net interest margin of 2.87% was lower by only 1 basis point compared to the second quarter, as the pace of decline continued to moderate. As such, this result is the smallest linked quarter decline in over three years.","New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by 2 basis points, as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. In addition, the margin decreased 1 basis point from higher deposit volumes and costs, which primarily resulted from the successful CD campaigns discussed last quarter.","These declines were largely offset by a 2 basis point increase from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. Through nine months, the net interest margin is 2.89%. Given these results, we expect the full year margin will be within the range of 2.85% to 2.95% we outlined in January.","Turning to Slide 5. The loan portfolio grew $110 million or 2% annualized from the second quarter. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $169 million. Retail contributed $208 million of originated loan growth, which was almost entirely driven my strong residential mortgage growth of $201 million.","As is our practice, most of the newly originated residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid ARMs. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio were down $39 million from the second quarter due to a $248 million reduction in C&I. As Jack discussed earlier, this result was entirely driven by lower volumes and utilization rates in our mortgage warehouse lending business.","The period-end balance for this business was $839 million, down $312 million from June 30. However, the quarterly average balance decline for mortgage warehouse lending was only $45 million. Commercial real estate contributed solid originated growth of $209 million, marking the second consecutive quarter, the pace of originated commercial real estate growth has increased.","We experienced acquired loan run-off of $59 million this quarter compared to $58 million in the second quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter-end was $841 million.","The fourth quarter historically has been our strongest quarter in terms of loan originations, and our current view is for this trend to continue this year. However, with annualized loan growth of 5% through nine months, achieving the lower end of the range we outlined in January will be challenging.","Slide 6 shows the change in deposits by segment from the second quarter. Total deposits increased $845 million or 12% on an annualized basis, primarily due to continued progress gathering commercial deposits. Commercial grew $883 million in the quarter compared to a $39 million reduction in retail.","The seasonality of our municipal business had a favorable $486 million impact on commercial deposits. While the third quarter represents a seasonal low point for retail deposits with growth expected in the fourth quarter.","Broker deposits ended the quarter at $2.7 billion, an increase of $60 million. This small increase does not change our expectations that broker deposits will represent a decreasing percentage of our deposit base, as we continue to grow organically.","It is also worth noting that our loan-to-deposit ratio was 98% at the end of the quarter. Overall, we are very pleased with our progress gathering deposits and firmly believe that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships.","On Slide 7, we take a closer look at the 3% increase in non-interest income from the second quarter. The seasonal nature of insurance renewals increased non-interest income by $2.6 million, while the continued success of our customer interest rate swap business contributed an additional $1.2 million compared to the second quarter.","In addition, bank service charges improved $1 million, primarily as a result of one more business day in the third quarter and higher cost management fees, which have benefited from efforts to grow commercial deposits.","On Slide 8, we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Non-operating expenses decreased $2.9 million, primarily resulting from no branch closures in the third quarter. As you will recall, we closed 10 branches in the second quarter.","From an operating perspective, expenses were up $5.3 million from the second quarter, due in large part to a $4.3 million increase in compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting an additional workday and higher medical-related cost in the third quarter. While operating expenses were modestly higher than recent quarters. We remain confident our proactive approach to expense management will continue to control cost.","The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last five quarters. While the ratio ticked up slightly in the third quarter, the results were still generally consistent with recent quarters. As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important commitment of the company.","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 78 basis points remains below our peer group and top-50 banks, and has improved from 92 basis points in the third quarter of 2014.","Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years.","As shown on Slide 12, operating return on average assets increased 3 basis points from the second quarter. Notwithstanding this improvement, our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. Further progress will be achieved by balance sheet growth, fee income growth and an ongoing disciplined approach to expenses.","Looking at Slide 13, our return on average tangible equity was 10.5% for the third quarter, an improvement of 70 basis points on a linked quarter basis. As we continue to focus on our most important objective, improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric overtime.","Turning to Slide 14, we remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength. Capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management.","Slide 15 displays our interest risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see we remain asset sensitive though slightly less so than last quarter. However, we remain well-positioned for an eventual rise in interest rates.","Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up.","John Barnes","Thank you, David. As we have mentioned many times before, we remain committed to investing strategically and building the business for the long term. As such, we are pleased to announce today the acquisition of Kesten-Brown, a Bridgeport, Connecticut based insurance brokerage firm focused on commercial lines and employee benefits.","This acquisition will further diversify revenues through additional non-interest income as well as bolster our insurance business, which already placed People's United as the 12th largest bank in terms of insurance brokerage fee income for a recent industry report.","This concludes our presentation. Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you have.","Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.","David Hochstim","Can you give us an update on opening new branches? I think Stop & Shop bought some A&P branches. Will you be expanding into those?","John Barnes","We are engaged with Stop & Shop to talk about that, and don't have an answer there at this time. And I don't know that they've fully developed their plans as well as they move through that transaction. We do under our existing contracts expect during the next fiscal year '16 that we may have some activity in Connecticut and New York.","David Hochstim","And about other non-supermarket branches, any new plans?","John Barnes","Nothing new. We do look and certainly get approached, but we have no new plans at this time.","David Hochstim","And could you talk a bit more about pricing? What you're seeing in commercial loans? Multifamily indicated that it was getting better, but -- ?","John Barnes","Well, basically, I would say stable in the multifamily arena, and really the spreads run differently based on the lines of business. We've kind of seen actually a little slight improvement in our larger portfolios, but many of our specialty businesses we're seeing continued pressure. So a bit of a mix bag across the portfolios.","David Hochstim","How about competition on the deposit side, rates there worst from -- ","David Rosato","The deposit environment hasn't really changed from our perspective in the last quarter and actually probably last two quarters. There are still some banks who are paying to attract money in money markets and you see occasional CD specials. We talked about this in the second quarter some small CD specials we ran. But the competitive environment is essentially unchanged.","David Hochstim","And then could you just say a little bit more about your net interest margin guidance for the year, it's still pretty wide range, we only have one quarter left?","David Rosato","Well, we're at 2.89% through the first three months. And as is our practice, we give annual guidance in January. So rather than just provide fourth quarter guidance at this point, we will stick with our 2.85% to 2.95% for the year.","David Hochstim","But I guess, are you signaling something dramatic that could happen in the fourth quarter or you're just not changing the guidance?","David Rosato","We are not signaling anything dramatic in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Casey Haire of Jefferies.","Casey Haire","Dave, wanted to follow-up on the expense outlook. By my math to hit the high-end of that guide of $845 million, we're looking at some about $4 million of leverage in the fourth quarter. Does that make sense? And if so, what are the drivers?","David Rosato","What I would say is we had a couple of one-timers in the third quarter. We called out the day count on comp and also the healthcare expenses. So at this point, we are still comfortable with comp. We still have comfort that we will hit our operating expense range that we set out at the beginning of the year of $835 million to $845 million.","Casey Haire","And then on the mortgage warehouse, obviously, that can be volatile and clearly went against you this quarter. It sounds like on an average basis, there is still some attrition on the come. I was just wondering from that $839 million level, do you expect it to settle from here on a period-end basis? And then what are the yields on mortgage warehouse?","John Barnes","Well, a couple of things. I think the very positive news for mortgage warehouse, if you look back over the last three or four years is the level of commitments that they have had outstanding has steadily increased. They've continued to build the business. And so the peak that we had in line utilization in the second quarter has proved to be right at the end of the period, proved to be more than we expected.","And in hindsight now it kind of feels like a lot of the discussion about the change in the regulatory disclosure was pushing volume, kind of pulling it through ahead of that transition and certainly our customer base kind of displayed that. If you look where the third quarter is and then go back to the first and the fourth quarter, those line utilizations has kind of come back to the range where it's been. So very much in line with those other quarters.","So kind of forecasting forward into the fourth quarter is difficult. There is certainly some discussion out there that mortgage bankers and Fannie and Freddie people expect things to slow. And we're evaluating that, especially as we think about the fourth quarter, but also the plan for next year.","I would say, our folks on the ground are cautiously expecting some continued reduction. But I don't see it as being dramatic right now. It's just like interest rates, how do you predict it.","David Rosato","So I was just going to say, the spreads are holding up nicely in that business. They run 2.5 to 2.75.","Casey Haire","And just last one for me. On the insurance field Kesten-Brown, just curious what's the revenue impact and capital impact? And when do you expect that deal to close?","David Rosato","Well, the deal is close. The revenue impact is they have our annual run rate in the neighborhood of $2.5 million to $3 million. It's not material from a capital impact for us.","John Barnes","It's just under 10% growth in the business, which is very attractive for us, the business lines and the customer base. There was actually a customer that we competed for. So it's nice to have the principals join the company and the entire team, they both kind of move forward with us. They have created a very successful business and we're looking forward to them, helping us continue to build our business here in Connecticut, which has a plenty of opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Ramsey of FBR.","Bob Ramsey","I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about expenses. I know you all indicated you still feel good with the full year guidance. And I was wondering if you could talk about the sort of unusual items this quarter. How much of it was the healthcare piece? And is that really non-recurring or is there somewhere where you expect to offset it in the fourth quarter?","David Rosato","The healthcare expenses were up $1.7 million in the quarter. We can clearly identify $700,000 that is non-reoccurring. Also if you look at healthcare cost year-over-year by quarter, you normally see an uptick in healthcare costs in the third or the fourth quarter, as employee start to meet their deductibles and there is a higher percentage share on the company. But we would expect in the fourth quarter our healthcare cost probably to recede a little bit from what we saw in the third quarter.","Bob Ramsey","So that's there. There's $700,000 that's non-recurring and maybe you recede a little bit on the rest. I guess I'm looking at total expenses to hit the full year guidance, seem to come down by about $5 million. So it's a piece of it. The day count won't really change. Where else are you all hoping to trim a little bit?","David Rosato","I think our comp line will come down a little bit in the fourth quarter. Also in this quarter the divisional incentives were up in some of our lines of business. And that will probably normalize as well in the fourth quarter.","Bob Ramsey","I'll just ask one other question and I'll hop out. But credit quality obviously is very strong for you guys, it always has been. How should we think about the provision cost and sort of certainly given your loan growth outlook and sort of the updated guidance there, how should we think about provisioning?","John Barnes","Well, I think, as we have laid out in the past, the way we think about provisioning is twofold. First is covering net charge-offs during a period, and then looking at growth in the portfolios and building the allowance accordingly based on loan type and our analysis about the provisioning that would be required for that. So its net charge-offs and then loan growth in the period.","David Rosato","If you look at allowance to loans and allowance to NPLs, you saw modest improvements in the third quarter relative to the second.","Bob Ramsey","And so maybe it's fair to the extent fourth quarter is seasonally strong for loan growth that the piece of the provision that's associated with growth would be slightly larger and that net charge-offs will sort of dictate the other piece of it, however that shakes out?","John Barnes","Yes. That's fair.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Sandler O'Neill & Partners.","Mark Fitzgibbon","First question I had, Jack, maybe you or David could share your thoughts on your current capital position and how you're thinking about that in relation to your projected growth?","David Rosato","As you saw, we had a very modest change in capital ratios, either did not -- regulatory ratios for the most part did not change. Tier 1 leverage was only down 10 basis points. So we are very comfortable based on the risk in our balance sheet with our capital position. We have discussed in the past from questions we've received our thoughts around future capital actions.","And on the call last quarter we talked about the possibility of a midyear preferred transaction in midyear 2016 really based on two factors. One was going to be loan growth this year as well as our sense around loan growth next year. So as we sit here today, we wouldn't change that assessment that we gave three months ago.","Mark Fitzgibbon","And then secondly on the acquisition front, I wonder if you feel like the company is operating at a level where you could do some larger bank acquisitions. Do you feel like you have capacity in the system to do something like that today?","John Barnes","Yes, absolutely we do, on kind of multiple levels and that we've built the company with a very strong foundation in terms of a scalable platform, if you will, strong risk management and governance structure. And if you look across our markets, there remains considerable opportunity for us to continue to augment our presence in the markets. And well we are and we'll continue to look for those opportunities, but we definitely feel prepared to do so.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","I don't want to beat a dead horse on the expenses, but just to take a minute to make sure we're on the same page. Do you guys consider your operating expense year-to-date of the $634.5 million, which is in the release, is that what you're considering when you're looking at your original full year guidance or you're making any adjustments to that number?","David Rosato","No, we're looking at the $634 million.","Steven Alexopoulos","So fourth quarter expenses you're saying will come down to $211 million, something like that, to get into the range.","David Rosato","That's our sense.","Steven Alexopoulos","I want to follow-up on Jack's comments about the most important objective being to improve profitability. I know in past calls you guys have indicated that without the help of rates, it's going to be tough to make dramatic steps forward in the efficiency ratio in terms of improvements. But given maybe some uncertainty on the rate front, is there a plan B to move the efficiency ratio down or does it just sit at 62%, so long as the fed is zero?","John Barnes","Well, I think granted it will be slow progress, depending on the rate of growth in the loan portfolio. But moving the businesses forward through the initiatives that we've undertaken to grow the various business lines and take on talent to do that, we would expect to move our revenue front forward without the benefit of a rate rise by growing our businesses both in the interest income categories and the fee businesses. And we are steadily doing that and we would continue to do that. And we think managing expense levels, despite those investments in a pretty darn tight range.","So we don't have a plan B that calls for dramatically changing the expense structure. We manage it very tightly. We find opportunities to reduce expenses. We've referenced in the past our ability to find and close branches effectively in the past. We mentioned our EMOC process.","So we've built pretty considerable risk management compliant structure and hired a lot of people in Boston and New York, and in ABL business, and the mortgage warehouse business and the wealth business, and we've maintained expense levels, while we've done that. So I would call that plan A. And I think we're working very hard at improving the efficiency ratio that way.","Steven Alexopoulos","Maybe if I could ask just one final on the tax rate, it looks like the lower tax rate data maybe a penny to the quarter. Were there any one-timers in there or for some reason should we be thinking about the lower tax rate going forward?","John Barnes","No. There were no one-timer, Steve. We were a little over accrued, when we did a midyear true-up.","Steven Alexopoulos","So not a run rate, then?","John Barnes","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","I guess first question, someone asked about the revenues of Kesten-Brown, I think you said it was $2.5 million to $3 million. Is that net revenues or is there any expenses that are associated with that?","David Rosato","There are expenses associated with that revenue. So that's gross total.","Ken Zerbe","That's gross revenue?","David Rosato","Correct.","Ken Zerbe","And so the net income benefit from that is -- what should we assume sort of a -- ","David Rosato","It's not something we are prepared to disclose.","Ken Zerbe","But it reasonably will be something less than the $3 million annual benefit. And then just in terms of loan growth, you made a comment that you're not going to hit your target this year. It's going to be tough challenging to hit your target for loan growth. Where have you been the most surprised? Like if you look back to beginning of year what headwind is now present that you were not expecting when you originally provided your guidance?","David Rosato","So the biggest headwind that we've had and actually we've had in prior periods has been commercial real estate portfolio, with our largest portfolio. And really over the last several years, maybe three or four now, it feels like it's become very, very competitive. There are more players that have come back into the business, and it's very difficult competitively really in every market in every type of lending that we do.","So we are pleased with the progress that we had in that area this quarter and prior. But overall, when we think about our guidance and our plan for this year, commercial real estate was the largest portion that has disappointed us.","We also have seen a slowdown in our PCLC equipment finance area, which really is more dynamic about some prior relationships that we had that fundamentally changed. We shared exposure with a couple of other parties and those relationships changed, because their circumstances where changing.","So we're originating actively and we're focused on getting that back on a better growth trajectory. In the meantime that has not grown at the same rate that it did in the prior really three years and probably beyond that.","Ken Zerbe","And then just last question, on the provision expense, I think in the past you said that it shouldn't meaningfully change more. It has been running in the past, I'm going to ballpark, and say, roughly $10 million, but it is come down over the last few quarters, and it's still in very, very good credit. But going forward from here, are we at a better run rate at $6 billion or is that more likely to trend closer to $10 billion, given what you're seeing?","John Barnes","Well, I think if you look at our net charge-offs, say, over the last eight quarters, it operates in a range that is very low. And for one quarter or another we may have a credit that we need to take a charge on, but thing have progressed really well. I think if you look at that range over those eight quarters, we don't expect that to change as far as we can see at this time going forward.","David Rosato","Just to put some numbers around that. It's probably, I think of it is kind of an $8 million to $10 million provision number. It had some recoveries that have taken the number down a little bit as well as the acquired loan portfolios winding down, and we were able to release some reserves from that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Darst of Guggenheim Securities.","David Darst","So David, maybe, would you drill into your technology budget for a minute, and then maybe talk about what maybe the top one and two things are that your incremental spending is going into right now and what your budgets are?","David Rosato","There is a couple of things. I mean in terms of kind of the overall budget, we obviously have very large core processing contract with FIS. That is the most significant commitment we have on the technology side. It's a pretty deep relationship, meaning, we use a lot of their products and services, applications that we run.","And I would say, maybe a way to think about overall our spend rather than kind of go into specific projects, I mean we could talk about that, and I'll give you a little color on that. I would say, as we look back on our capital spending over the last four or five years, we generally are continuing to invest in our products and try to improve our offerings, strengthen our offerings through technology. And that's been a fairly steady commitment and we don't see that changing in the near future.","We have an IT project staff that we run pretty hard, and you can only load so much on the process. So we kind of managed to a level of work and activity annually based on our priorities. So we are investing now in project, we have projects that will run to strengthen our commercial product set in cash management international services, in particular.","And we're also enhancing our loan system environment to help us improve our servicing capabilities in our large corporate area. And so we have those types of projects active and on the board. And of course, we invest in compliance and other types of activity that keep us in the right spot on the regulatory front.","David Darst","And based on kind of what you have and what you're investing in today, do you think there will be a material change in the budget for next year?","David Rosato","No.","David Darst","And then just maybe on deposits. You alluded to your broker deposits being declining as a percentage of mix going forward. Is something kind of changing with your ability to generate retail deposits or commercial deposits, kind of excluding municipals?","David Rosato","No. The only reason we mention the broker deposits was that they ticked up $60 million in the quarter, and it's just the timing issue. So that was the only reason it was worth mentioning. I mean the good news is we're continuing to have really nice momentum in commercial and retail deposit gathering as a company. And where we really have been moving the needle is on the commercial side. And that as this audience on the call knows is something that we've been talking about for a couple of years now and having really nice success.","Operator","Our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert of KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","If I could just go back to your comments about loan growth, so obviously it's going to come in a little bit lower in the fourth quarter in that 8%. I think you guys had guided 8% to 12% at the beginning of the year, so below that. But just trying to reconcile that with your comments David about still thinking there would be a need for a midyear preferred issue.","As you guys kind of look at your landscape and you're talking to your customers and you go into the budgeting process in the fall, and everything that's happened globally, is your expectation that loan growth could rebound in '16? I mean how are you just thinking about it kind of in a broader sense?","David Rosato","Sure. Just broader, just talk about the preferred for a minute. So if you want to get really minute on it, we had slower growth in the third quarter than we though we would have, right. So you could take that preferred deal and push it out, let's say, three months. And that conceivably could happen. But today as we sit here, there's an expectation that we'll have reasonable loan growth in the fourth quarter.","And as we start working through the budget process, there is no reason to think that the momentum and the people that we have in the field and the customer relationships, there is a fundamental change in our ability to grow loan. So with all that said at a high-level, I can see a need for capital some time in the back half of 2016, whether it's midyear or whether it's some time in the third quarter or the beginning the fourth quarter, it's an open question at this point.","John Barnes","We certainly have a lot of confidence in the various business lines and the people that are running and active in those businesses and building customer relationships that that will continue. And I think that's at the heart on the loan growth side of that on the balance sheet side of it.","We've got a very good track record, if you look back over the last three years. We've got an average, probably 9%, 10% growth. And we continue to build those businesses and expect to make progress. I agree 2% GDP economic growth environment is not 4% straightly, but we continue to build relationships.","Collyn Gilbert","And then just quickly, David, back to the preferred, and if you guys have said this, I apologize. But what's kind of your capital targets, your tier 1 targets or whatever that's? Just to think about the whole that you'd be looking to sell?","David Rosato","Sure. So what we said on the call last time was that people backed into an issuance size of somewhere between $150 million to $250 million issuance. And that would not address obviously PCE, but it would address all of our regulatory ratios. We've also said that today as we sit here, our capital ratios are above our targets, our internal targets. But as you project growth, obviously those ratios will come down and you need to be fortified at some point.","Collyn Gilbert","And then just a final question. Jack, just coming back to your comments on M&A and indicating that you guys could be in a position to really be ready to do large M&A. Can you just sort of frame that for us in terms of what your interest or appetite could be on larger M&A?","John Barnes","Well, what do you mean by larger?","Collyn Gilbert","I don't know. That's what I think the question was. I have definitely written in all caps in my notes. So it sounded like it was [multiple speakers].","John Barnes","There are a lot of potential partners for us that across our Northeast corridor that some that are very attractive at $2 billion and some at $10 billion. And so we have a very good track record in terms of acquisitions and moving through integrations and conversions.","We have a great playbook that we have used in the past that we continue to update and be prepared when the right opportunity comes. We're also very disciplined and thoughtful about what we do. And we'll continue on that track.","So my reference to being prepared is just that that we look at our history. And moving through whether for this organization it was Chittenden acquisition at the time, which was a significant undertaking, and what we've done since, we've executed very well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Breese of Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Breese","Just curious, one more on the Kesten-Brown acquisition. Can you provide us with the dollar amount projected for intangibles or goodwill created?","John Barnes","No. Not at this point.","Matthew Breese","And then, going back to your asset sensitivity and some of the changes there, given the lack of a fed funds hike and some uncertainty around how and if the fed will move interest rates this year, was that intentional? Was this tied to the mortgage, the decline in mortgage warehouse balances? Can you just give us some color around why the shift?","David Rosato","First of all, I would say, it was a very modest decrease in asset sensitivity, really driven. If you'll notice the securities portfolio grew in the quarter and so that was the number one driver of the decrease in asset sensitivity. And then I would also just say that, if you pick the five year point on the swaps curve, quarter-over-quarter five year swaps were down about 40 basis points. So you're starting from a lower interest rate level, when you run your models and that also had a modest impact.","Matthew Breese","And then just touching on the potential preferred equity raise, can you walk us through the thought process of going down that avenue versus taking potentially some other capital strategies such as sub-debt or maybe potentially changing the payout ratio, which is a lot higher than a lot of your peers?","David Rosato","Well, I would start with our job is to manage capital ratios, both at the bank and at the holding company level. And I'd remind you that we did do a $400 million bank sub-debt issuance towards the end of the second quarter of 2014. As you can see some of the residual effects of that, where at the bank we have higher total risk-based capital currently, and you can see the changes overtime.","So we go back to -- there has been a long evolution of capital management at this company going back to being grossly over capitalized coming out of the Tier 2 second step conversions. And there has been a series of acquisitions, we bought back 25% of the stock that was issued in that transaction through a bunch of buybacks, and we've also had a nice and strong dividend payout to shareholders.","So the capital rules under Basel III are pretty clear about what an efficient capital structure is, and those efficient capitals structure does include preferred. And our job is to create that efficient capital structure, the most efficient capital structure we can for shareholders. And that's the simple logic behind the need to add preferred at some point and into the capital structure. And if you look at our peer group, you'll see many of them, not all of them, but many of them who have preferred in their capital structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Rochester of Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","Just quickly on the tax rate, were you guys saying that we should expect that to rebound back to that 34% level next quarter as the true-ups roll-off?","David Rosato","No. It will rebound, if you will, to about 33.5%.","Dave Rochester","And then just back on capital quickly. As you guys try to formulate how much capital you need, but what do you see is limiting regulatory capital ratio that you're watching more closely? And then, just second part to that, if you were to see the TCE ratio decline to a 6% handle next year, is that an issue at all with the regulators, given you're still growing or is it not something to worry about?","David Rosato","Well, two questions there. The first is what is the most limiting capital ratio for us. I would say it's total risk-based capital. We're a commercial bank, we generate a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets overtime. That was the reason that we had the bank level sub-debt issuance last year. I mean you threw out a hypothetical 6% TCE ratio -- ","Dave Rochester","Or just a 6% handle.","David Rosato","A 6% handle, and then couch that with issues with regulators. What we have talked about is TCE will probably end up the year at about a 720 or so rate, dependent on growth. We've said last quarter that that's about where our long-term preference is. In the short-term in this interest rate environment, we would have a tolerance to let it slip below that for a short period of time.","But we also believe that there will be some rate relief at some points that will help us create more cap, internal capital generation, even with our dividend payout ratio. So it's an internal comfort level, much more than a discussion with our regulators.","Dave Rochester","And just lastly, this is a long-term question here. But since you guys are still below $40 billion, you don't need to worry about this, this year, probably even next year, but I do have you crossing through $40 billion in assets at some point over the next couple years. Just wondering, at what point you actually have to start that glide path to crossing the $50 billion threshold and discussing that with your regulators and getting your systems ready. At what point you start having to do that?","John Barnes","Well, actually we've been talking about that for a couple of years and we've actually continued to work at it and on kind of the multiple fronts and trying to understand what it would mean and try to -- our view is that we should gradually to be ready. And that's the longer-term view that we've been taking.","So there is a lot of different angles on kind of the management of data being prepared to deal with big data being understanding what a CCAR filing is in detail, and then examining your data for that type of thing and examining other components of it.","So on multiple fronts we spend time and we give folks assignments and we also work with others in the industry to try to understand from their experiences what that means. And then we make preparation, as we don't want to get there eventually and start when it's too late.","Dave Rochester","Do any of those expenses -- sorry, go ahead.","David Rosato","Dave, the only thing I was going to add to that is we're a good DFAST bank, and we got there in the same approach that Jack is talking about. We got ahead of it early. We've build out a team overtime and improved our capabilities, and it was all just built into the run rate.","Dave Rochester","So I guess, as you're kind of in the process of thinking through this. Do you think that it might be not until maybe 2017 that you start seeing some accelerated expands in this area in terms of building out for this or would you expect that to be pushed even more into the future?","John Barnes","At this point, we're not expecting any accelerated expenses to hit us, but we don't have all the answers either. So we are making the incremental investments, as David, DFAST point is a real good one. We've built that staff over the last number of years and it came into our run rate.","And those are the kinds of things that we are doing incrementally to be compliant with DFAST and the requirements and successfully meet that requirement. So when we talk about expenses and say that we're managing expenses at a level, while we are also meeting increased regulatory compliance demands and making the investments in the businesses, those were the references we're talking about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan","Steven Alexopoulos","Just one follow-up on all this commentary around the larger M&A and CCAR. Jack you threw out two asset sizes that would each keep you below the CCAR line, much of that was intentional or not, but do you have an appetite to do a deal large enough that it would make you a CCAR bank sooner than later?","John Barnes","I would say it would depend on kind of the answer I just gave about preparedness and the time it takes. I don't think that we are clear yet about that and we continue to work at it. So I guess the right kind of response would be, we don't know enough yet to know exactly what those requirements are. So we would not prepare to undertake that without that understanding.","Steven Alexopoulos","I'll also add, just given that you have a dividend payout ratio that's significantly higher than the other CCAR banks, which I would guess would also be a consideration for you.","John Barnes","Correct.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the time we have for questions. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Hersom for closing remarks.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you, again, for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in People's United.

Good day."],"17017":["People's United Financial Inc., (NASDAQ:PBCT) Q4 2015 Earnings Conference Call January 20, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Andrew Hersom - SVP, IR","Jack Barnes - President & CEO","David Rosato - CFO","Analysts","Bob Ramsey - FBR","Casey Haire - Jefferies","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities","Collyn Gilbert - KBW","Matthew Breese - Piper Jaffray","Operator","Welcome to the People's United Financial Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Andrew and I will be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Senior Executive Vice President; and Jeff Hoyt, our Controller. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 1 of this presentation which is posted on our website, peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. As you have already seen from our release earlier today, we reported operating earnings per share of $0.22 for the fourth quarter, bringing the full year result to $0.87 per share, a 6% increase from the prior year. This marks the sixth consecutive year of growth in operating earnings per share. These results are driven by the strategic investments we have made in talent, products and services. Throughout 2015, we continued to move the Company forward by organically growing loans and deposits, strengthening fee businesses, implementing technology enhancements and furthering cross-sell efforts.","As always, we continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and improve operating efficiency. As such, on November 1 we closed on the sale of our payroll services business to the Company's current payroll software licensor and entered into a long-term referral agreement. The sale provides customers high quality payroll solutions at comparable cost and minimal transition impact.","Also during the quarter we strengthened our consumer credit card offering by entering into a new partnership with Elan Financial Services, a subsidiary of U.S. Bank. This arrangement provides consumers with a full suite of MasterCard-branded products with valuable reward options, as well as access to enhance payments technology. This is an exciting opportunity to meet the ongoing needs of our customers while generating additional revenue for the Company.","Now I'd like to discuss our results in further detail. I will speak to our full-year performance which can be seen on slides 2 through 8. And consistent with past January calls, I will also outline our goals for 2016. David will follow to go over the fourth quarter results.","Our 2015 performance reflects ongoing revenue growth and proactive expense management. Record full-year operating earnings of $263 million increased over 7% from the prior year. The continued successful execution of our business strategies is demonstrated by strong annual loan and deposit growth of 7% and 9% respectively, as well as sustained excellent asset quality across all of our portfolios. Operating results were driven by revenue growth of 3%, reflecting improvements in both net interest income and non-interest income.","Despite net interest margin compression of 21 basis points, net interest income grew 2%, primarily driven by continued loan growth as well as higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio. These improvements were partially offset by runoff in the acquired loan portfolio and modestly higher deposit costs. The net interest margin continued to be impacted by new business yields remaining lower than the total portfolio yield. However, it's worth noting that the pace of the net interest margin decline moderated during the course of the year and was flat from the third to fourth quarter.","Non-interest income, excluding non-operating gains in both years, increased 4%, primarily due to higher commercial banking lending fees and a continued success of our customer interest rate swap business. Non-interest expenses increased 2%. Non-operating expenses increased $3.4 million which is mainly attributable to higher branch closing costs.","In 2015 we closed 18 branches compared to 8 in the prior year as we continued to optimize our branch delivery channel. Since the beginning of 2011 we have closed 54 branches which were mostly traditional branches. During the same time period we opened 25 branches, of which 16 are more cost efficient in-store locations. In-store branches also provide us the unique opportunity to engage with the 3.3 million shoppers who visit Connecticut and New York Stop and Shop locations each week.","From an operating perspective, expenses increased less than 2%, primarily due to higher costs related to compensation and benefits, as well as professional and outside services. Overall, we're pleased with the Company's performance this year and our ability to sustain momentum we have built in recent years.","On slide 9, we included a snapshot of last year's goals compared to the actual results. As you can see, we were in line with all of our goals with the exception of the operating expenses which were slightly above the expected range. However, we remain confident in our ability to control costs going forward, notwithstanding the continued impact of higher regulatory compliance costs, as well as our ongoing commitment to strategically invest in the Company to create value for both customers and shareholders.","I wanted to take a moment on slide 10 to reflect on the significant progress we have made moving the Company forward over the past five years, particularly in light of the operating environment. We have been consistent in our approach, building the franchise for the long term. Over this time, we have remained committed to investing strategically to further grow the franchise and our expanded footprint, as well as deepen our presence across all of our heritage markets. We have also never wavered from our approach to relationship banking which customers recognize as an important differentiator.","Our extensive suite of products is comparable to that of the larger banks and our focus on exceptional customer service at the local level has uniquely positioned us in the Northeast Corridor. Accordingly, our balance sheet has experienced annual loan growth of over 10% since 2010. Importantly, this growth has more than offset significant net interest margin compression. As a result, net interest income excluding accretion has increased at an annual rate of over 7% during the period.","Additionally, over the past five years we have strengthened our fee-based businesses, as evidenced by 4% annual growth in non-interest income, despite industry headwinds. Building on this progress continues to be an important area of focus in order to further diversify revenues.","Finally, we look at the totality of our customer relationships from not only loan and fee income perspectives, but also deposits. Deposits are a large component of profitability. As such, we have emphasized deposit gathering across the organization and have made it clear that deposits are an integral part of customer relationships. Success of these efforts is demonstrated by the annual growth of organic deposits of well over 7% since 2010, with particularly strong results last year.","Turning to slide 11, you can see how our approach to building the franchise has favorably impacted profitability. Over the past five years full-year operating earnings per share has increased from $0.34 to $0.87, a compound annual growth rate of over 20%. This increase was primarily driven by our ability to grow earning assets both organically and through acquisitions which enabled us to more than offset the negative impacts of the extended low interest rate environment on net interest margin.","Given our unique position in the market which will drive continued increases in earning assets and our commitment to further strengthen fee-based businesses, we're confident in our ability to deliver consistent, quality earnings growth for shareholders.","Turning to slide 12, before discussing our goals for the New Year, I wanted to mention a reporting change in the coming year. Beginning with first quarter 2016 results, we will no longer classify expenses related to ordinary and recurring branch closures and severance as non-operating. We believe this decision will help to simplify our financial disclosures. In order to he provide a better understanding of underlying performance and trends, we will continue to highlight items of significance that we consider nonrecurring or infrequent in nature which impact GAAP results.","With this reporting change impacting our expense goal in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2016. First goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 6% to 8%. Secondly, our continued emphasis on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 4% to 6% range. This assumes no growth in brokered deposits. The next goal is for net interest income to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of 2.85% to 2.95%. This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of one 25- basis point rate increase in mid-2016.","We expect non-interest income levels, after adjusting for the gain on the sale of the Company's payroll services business, to be consistent year over year. Total expenses for the year are expected to be in the range of $865 million to $885 million as compared to 2015 total expenses of $861 million. The range includes expenses related to seven planned branch openings, of which six are in-store branches. We will maintain excellent credit quality, with a provision in the range of $40 million to $50 million.","Finally, we will maintain strong capital levels, with an expectation that tangible common equity to tangible assets will finish the year in the range of 7% to 7.2%. In addition, as we have mentioned on previous calls, we expect to issue preferreds in the second half of the year. We look forward to executing on the opportunities we have created to achieve these goals. With that, I'll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. With respect to our fourth quarter performance, please turn to slide 13 for an overview. Operating earnings increased 3% from the prior-year quarter to $67 million. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $0.22, consistent year over year. I will discuss the other results shown on this overview on subsequent slides.","On slide 14 we provide the detail behind the linked quarter increase in net interest income of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter. Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio, as well as strong loan growth, increased net interest income by $2.7 million and $2.2 million respectively. Net interest income also benefited from slightly lower deposit cost.","On slide 15, net interest margin of 2.87% was consistent with the third quarter. This marks the first time net interest margins has not declined on a linked quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011. Higher average balances and yields in the securities portfolio increased the margin by 1 basis point. While new loan volume unfavorably impacted margin by 1 basis point, as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield.","Turning to slide 16, as we discussed previously, the fourth quarter historically has been our strongest in terms of loan originations. And the fourth quarter of 2015 continued this trend. The loan portfolio grew $739 million or 11% annualized from the third quarter, marking the 21st consecutive quarter of growth. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $784 million. Originated loans in the commercial portfolio increased $685 million from the third quarter, as growth was broadly diversified.","C&I contributed $207 million of total originated growth, while commercial real estate and equipment financing added $260 million and $145 million respectively. Within C&I the mortgage warehouse quarter-end balance was $963 million, up $124 million from September 30, as balances were aided by TRID-related purchase delays which have since subsided. Retail contributed $99 million of originated loan growth which was driven by residential mortgage growth of $86 million.","As is our practice, most of the residential mortgages retained in our portfolio were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The consumer portfolio had $13 million of originated growth, its largest quarterly increase in over a year. We experienced acquired loan runoff of $45 million this quarter, compared to $59 million in the third quarter. The remaining balance of the acquired portfolio at quarter end was $797 million.","Slide 17 shows the change in deposits by segment from the third quarter. Total deposits increased $137 million or 2% on an annualized basis. As planned, we reduced brokered deposits by nearly $100 million during the quarter. As such organic deposit growth was $232 million or 4% annualized. Retail grew $251 million or 5% annualized in the quarter, compared to a $114 million reduction in commercial. Excluding the reduction in brokered deposits, retail grew $345 million or 8% annualized. In commercial, the seasonality in our municipal business had a negative impact on deposits of $170 million during the fourth quarter.","It is also worth noting that our cost of deposits came down 1 basis point in the quarter. Overall, we're very pleased with our progress-gathering deposits. As we maintain emphasis on franchise-wide cross-sell and deposit gathering efforts, we should continue to see further growth.","On slide 18 we take a closer look at the change in non-interest income which, excluding the $9.2 million gain from the sale of the payroll services business, declined $3 million or 3%, from the third quarter. As expected, insurance revenues lowered non-interest income by $1.6 million due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals. In addition, lower bank service charges, primarily due to three fewer business days in the fourth quarter and lower commercial banking fees, negatively impacted non-interest income by $1.4 million and $1.1 million respectively.","On slide 19 we illustrate the key components of changes in non-interest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Non-operating expenses increased $3.7 million, reflecting lease buyouts on branches that were previously closed, as well as severance-related costs. From an operating perspective, expenses improved nearly $1 million from the third quarter due to a decrease in compensation and benefits. Expenses were also favorably impacted by lower regulatory assessments of $2.4 million as a result of a credit received for overpayment of FDIC assessments in prior quarters.","A primary offset to these improvements was a $900,000 increase in professional and outside services. Similar to previous quarters this year, the increase is primarily related to costs associated with a number of initiatives focusing on enhancing our product offerings and processes.","Fourth quarter operating expenses were modestly higher than the $211 million we guided to on October's call as a result of higher than expected incentives, as well as the timing of costs related to healthcare, a single REO property and professional and outside services. As we have discussed before, we continue to tightly control expenses while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of regulatory compliance.","As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401-K matches and winter-related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, expenses are expected to be approximately $5 million higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter total expenses of $217 million.","The next slide displays our efficiency ratio improvement in the fourth quarter compared to recent quarters. As we have mentioned before, continuing to improve operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management remains a highly important focus of the Company.","Slide 21 is a reminder of our excellent credit quality across each of our portfolios. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 66 basis points remains below our peer group and top 50 banks and has improved from 88 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Net charge-offs for the quarter remained at a very low level. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets as well as our conservative and well-defined underwriting philosophy that has served us so well for many years. As shown on slide 22, operating return on average assets decreased slightly, but remained generally consistent with recent quarters. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the interest rate environment. Our return on average tangible equity was 10.2% for the fourth quarter, a decrease of 30 basis points on a linked quarter basis, but an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter. As we continue to focus on improving profitability, we expect to see further progress in this metric over time.","Turning to slide 23, capital levels at the holding company and the bank continue to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and history of exceptional credit risk management. Finally, on slide 24, we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, we remain asset sensitive and well positioned for rising interest rates as our loan mix continues to trend towards floating rate loans. At yearend, 42% of the loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based, up from 38% a year ago, as 56% of originations in 2015 were floating rate loans.","Now, I'd like to pass it back to Jack to wrap up.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, David. Looking ahead to the New Year, the franchise is well positioned to achieve ongoing growth as we continue to execute on the significant opportunities that exist across our attractive footprint, particularly in the Boston and New York markets. We remain focused on improving profitability while continuing to build the business for long-term success.","This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey from FBR. Your line is open.","Bob Ramsey","My first question, I want to be sure I heard you correctly. On the expense guide for the first quarter, I know you said it would be up by about $5 million. Was that from the GAAP $217 million or from the operating $213 million base?","Jack Barnes","That's the GAAP $217 million.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. So something in the ballpark of $222 million is what you expect in the first quarter.","Jack Barnes","That's correct, Bob.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. And then on the fee income guidance for the year, I know you guys expect it to be more or less flat. Maybe you could just give a little bit more color about sort of which lines are growing which lines are contracting and sort of how you shake out at the flat number overall?","David Rosato","Sure, Bob. It's David. So underlying that, there's solid growth across wealth management, cash management. And from the highest level, the fee income challenge for us which is really an industry issue, is just bank service charges and within that we're really talking about NSF fees. That was down year over year 2014 to 2015 and we would expect a similar trend from 2015 to 2016.","Bob Ramsey","Okay. But I guess still in 2015 you all, let me check here before I say - your total deposit fees were relatively flat. You were down a few million, but you were able to offset that with growth in all of the other line items. And so if we do a similar sort of level of maybe decline in 2016 on that area, I guess I'm just curious why you're not seeing more offset in the other lines?","Jack Barnes","Well, we're seeing I guess, again, if you look across wealth management which will grow - we expect our wealth management business to grow in the 7% to 8% range year over year, insurance revenue will be up over 10%, call it 10% to 12% year over year, cash management will be 6% to 8% as well. So the offsets would be the bank service charges.","The other thing I would mention would be - we also will have strong growth in our business credit card income. That will probably be about $2.5 million or so over the course of the year. As a reminder, we did the payroll services sale that we mentioned, that's a little over $4 million of a headwind as well.","David Rosato","Gain on sale in the mortgage business down.","Jack Barnes","Yes, gain on sale will be down modestly.","Bob Ramsey","Maybe part of what I'm missing was the payroll services sale. And so thanks for pointing out that's about $4 million. What is the expense side of that piece? Just want to be sure I kind of take it out everywhere appropriately.","Jack Barnes","That expense base is about $3.3 million, $3.4 million,.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Casey Haire","So wanted to, I guess, touch on I guess, first clarify on the fee guide. Is that maintained non-interest levels with 2015 of $343 million? Is that about right? Or is that versus the fourth quarter run rate?","Jack Barnes","No, it's full year, the $343 million.","Casey Haire","And the payroll business, the $4 million of fees, that's per annum or is that per quarter?","Jack Barnes","That's per annum.","Casey Haire","Now switching to NII, if I layer in your loan and deposit growth, it looks like the loan balances are going to grow more than deposits and take your loan to deposit ratio above 100%. So you had mentioned you're not going to use brokered deposits. Was it going to be the funding source for the incremental loan growth above deposit growth?","Jack Barnes","It will be wholesale borrowings, most likely from the Home Loan Bank of Boston.","David Rosato","It's still coming in right around--","Jack Barnes","Yes.","David Rosato","We're not expecting it to go much further over 100%.","Jack Barnes","That's correct.","Casey Haire","Right, yes. No, it's not much. But, okay, understood. I'm assuming that's going to be relatively short term in nature, those borrowings?","Jack Barnes","Yes. With the way we see the economic and interest rate environment today, that would be our plan.","Casey Haire","Okay. So I guess what I'm wondering is we have - and you also have a Fed hike baked in mid-year 2016. We also have the one from December last month, with some wholesale borrowings which could help your funding source. Why is NIM going to be flat on the year? Wouldn't that be stronger with those kind of tailwinds?","Jack Barnes","You're right from the benefit that we receive for our asset sensitivity across an ever-growing loan book that's floating. But there also is an assumption there with what's been going on in the last several weeks about a flattening of the yield curve. So we've seen 20 to 25 basis points come out of the whole yield curve in the last couple weeks and that gives us a little bit of pause.","Casey Haire","Just last one from me. You guys mentioned M&A as something you guys were looking to pursue last quarter. Just any updated thoughts there and activity levels, chatter, et cetera?","Jack Barnes","I would say no new color and I know we got more questions on it last quarter. I'd say our general efforts on the M&A front, looking to be opportunistic and certainly have relationships has been consistent for quite some time. And it's the same now. So certainly would be interested in good opportunities if we can make them happen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Darst from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","David Darst","Jack, just following up on the M&A question, is there a size fit that you would kind of consider optimal to keep you in a comfortable range below $50 billion?","Jack Barnes","No. I think last quarter we mentioned $2 billion to $10 billion. Is that a kind of hard line on both ends? No. Again, I think I was trying to be responsive to a specific question about size last time. But there is a variety of potential partners across the Northeast that we find a good match for us in terms of business model, et cetera. We would be interested if it makes sense across the size spectrum, if you will.","David Darst","Okay. And then as you're looking at growing your core deposits this year, are you anticipating any more deposit competition or do you think you'll have to raise rates to gather the funding that you want?","David Rosato","The short answer is no, not really. To date, we really haven't seen any change in level of competition on deposits in our market. Again, we've only seen one Fed move. But I tend to think that is going to stick. So we've been able to continue to deepen relationships and grow our deposits across all fronts, meaning retail, commercial and then government banking within the commercial segment as well very nicely last year and we expect that to continue this year as well.","David Darst","Okay. Just on the GE headquarters relocation, do you think that there's any impact either to Connecticut or Boston for you from that?","Jack Barnes","I would say yes, naturally, but nothing - I think short term material in nature, had very disappointed phone calls from Fairfield County and some very happy phone calls from Boston. So interesting how it impacts different parts of our footprint. But the Boston folks are very optimistic about it over time. When we look at Connecticut, Fairfield County, naturally it's a big disappointment to lose that headquarters.","If we look at our portfolio, we have a very modest amount of personal loans, residential loans to the GE employees. And when you really stop and think about it, some of those mortgages are 20 years old and some are 10 years old and some are a couple years old. So when you think about it from an impact of the portfolios and the bank deposits, et cetera, it's not going to be significant.","Over time, I think depending on how many people, they're talking about 200 people going from Connecticut. So again, when you think about the real estate market and other things, we don't expect it to be significant.","David Rosato","I would just add, the GE Capital has been going on for about 1.5 years now and we haven't seen any impact, noticeable impact from that as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert from KBW. Your line is open.","Collyn Gilbert","Dave, maybe could you just talk a little bit about the securities portfolio? And I guess maybe specifically what's driving the strategy to grow that book? I think it was up a fair bit this quarter, just how you're thinking about that.","David Rosato","Sure. We have grown it in the last year. Really the strategy - and there was some growth in the fourth quarter as well. Part of it is to create interest income in this low rate environment in a very low risk asset class. But also what we did in the fourth quarter was really, in our view, in response to what we thought was a developing weakness in the economy.","So we were starting to watch what was going on in the commodity space. Didn't think we'd have anything like what were experienced in the last couple of weeks. But we decided it was probably prudent to put a little more leverage on the balance sheet. From a mix of securities, we're not doing anything different than what we've done in the past. So there was a small reduction in short CMO paper, but the growth - that was replaced and then the additional growth was primarily in 15-year pass-throughs. And then we added to our municipal securities book as well.","But that's been our strategy for the last couple of years from an asset selection perspective. So really just what changed was a little bit of a growing sense that a little more fixed rate assets on the books was appropriate.","Collyn Gilbert","And maybe we could kind of segue to my next question? Just on your general outlook for the environment, the economic environment. Commercial real estate, obviously there's been increased discussion around exposures there and increasing leverage there. Can you just talk a little about maybe what you're seeing in the market and just what your general view is overall?","Jack Barnes","I think our general view - I've been not overly optimistic, but I've been optimistic through the end of the year. The jobs report, the end of the year, 290,000, I felt like certainly the Fed was going to move and that the general momentum was going to continue. And in the last three weeks obviously there's been a lot of fear about China and oil prices, et cetera. It still doesn't feel to me like that cautious optimism needs to change.","Our companies - our customers and the companies that we do business with are going to continue to make progress and operate at a profitable level. Consumers have deleveraged. You look at our numbers around problem loans and the like and the demand side, things are pretty good. So we're concerned about certainly the noise right now and concerned about what it's doing for the yield curve, et cetera. But I'd say we're cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy and the Northeast economy is going to continue to move forward at a similar pace to where we've been.","We certainly appreciate the regulatory concerns about commercial real estate. And I would say the largest piece of that is concern about rates staying as low as they've been for as long and what's that done to cap rates and valuations. But when we look at our portfolio and the performance of it, we feel very good about the consistency and our approach to underwriting over time and including right up until today. And the performance of the credits have been very strong. Our non-performers, our delinquency, our charge-off in commercial real estate is quite modest. And we believe it will continue to be that way.","So a lot of discipline in our underwriting, I hope that the messages from the regulators will take some of the more competitive counters that we sometimes get with customers off the table. I hope it slows some people down that are being a little too aggressive, but we'll see.","Collyn Gilbert","And then one just final housekeeping, Dave what tax rate should we use for 2016?","David Rosato","33.5%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey from FBR. Your line is open.","Bob Ramsey","Just a quick housekeeping, could you tell me where the payroll services revenue line which line item does that go in? Is it in the Other line?","David Rosato","Yes, it's in other.","Bob Ramsey","In terms of margin, I know you've given sort of an outlook for the year. I was wondering if you could help us sort of think about what the trajectory looks like? I guess maybe particularly how we start the year off in the first quarter. Do you see any modest lift from the move that took place in December or do we start a little bit lower and then build? Or just kind of curious how you're thinking about it?","David Rosato","Sure. What's somewhat interesting is normally you lose two days in the first quarter which usually has about a 5 basis point impact. We have a leap year this year. So just rates not changing, you would have this year about a 3 basis point decline in the margin. That will be offset with the action by the Feds last month.","So at this point with the uncertainties around the steepness of the yield curve, I would expect that, for the full year, we would be right about the middle of the guidance that we're giving. And I would think around a fairly steady margin over the course of the year, similar to what you saw in 2015.","If you go back and look at the quarters in 2015, we were down, I believe, 9 basis points from first to second quarter, down 1 second to third and then flat in the third and fourth. And so we've really seen a flattening out of the margin on a quarter-to quarter basis. So aside from a little noise in this quarter from day count negative, Fed tightening last month a positive, we'll have roughly a fairly flat margin over the course of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew Breese","Just thinking about the preferred equity offering, I know you've given some detail on it in the past. Now that we're closer, I was just hoping for an updated estimate on the size of that offering.","Jack Barnes","We haven't really changed our thinking around that. So the size is in the $200 million to $250 million range. Timing is still in the back half of the year.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And then going back to the M&A discussion, I know you outlined some size parameters. But across your footprint, are there any geographies you find more or less attractive? How would you think about maybe going outside of your core footprint and looking for contiguous geographies?","Jack Barnes","We would be and have been, open to contiguous adjacent markets, again, that fit our profile and continue to build the franchise in, I guess, what we would consider a logical way. We like having the franchise cover the market effectively and kind of benefit from that contiguous branch footprint and bankers in the markets in a consistent way. So across the Northeast Corridor, including adjacent markets are on our list, if you will.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].

My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our second quarter results. Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 from our presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our second quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $67.2 million or $0.20 per share, up from $60.6 million or $0.18 per share in the first quarter. Net income after -- net income for the quarter, including non-operating items, was $64.8 million or $0.19 per share. The net interest margin declined to 3.97% compared to the 4.01% in the first quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields and higher levels of securities purchased earlier in the quarter in anticipation of our receipt of the proceeds for the Citizens branch transaction late in the quarter. This is partially offset by cost recovery income related to negotiated settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio.","Loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios, amounted to 2.3% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth.","Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 11.2% on an annualized basis. Noninterest income increased $3.3 million compared to the first quarter, reaching $75.7 million. This increase was primarily due to growth in cash management fees, operating lease income, prepayment fees and gain on sale of acquired loans.","The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% from 63.2% in the first quarter. This is a result of improved operating leverage from higher revenues and lower expenses. Capital ratios remained strong with the tangible equity ratio at 11.5% for the second quarter. We continue to make progress deploying our capital through balance sheet growth and share repurchase activity.","On Slide 3, we discussed several recent initiatives. Most importantly, we continue to expand our presence in key growth markets such as the New York metro area. We recently completed the acquisition of 57 Citizens branches in the greater New York metro area and rebranded all of the acquired branches over the weekend of June 22. 53 of the branches are in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches.","Through these branches, we will be reaching approximately 900,000 weekly visitors to Stop & Shop stores, which will significantly strengthen our brand awareness in the country's largest MSA. We now serve customers in approximately 100 branches in the New York metro area. As is the case throughout our footprint, we strive to bank the market. As we continue to build our deposit footprint in the New York metro area, we are simultaneously adding asset generation capabilities.","First, as we have said about our Stop & Shop branches in Connecticut, we generate a substantial portion of our residential mortgage and home equity originations through these in-store branches. We also see significant commercial activity in these branches. In time, we expect the recently acquired branches will also become significant asset generators.","In addition, we have expanded our C&I and asset-based lending efforts in New York metro area, adding 5 seasoned in-market C&I lenders on Long Island and 2 ABL professionals.","Recently, we also added 3 senior New York commercial real estate professionals. These individuals have spent their careers focused on New York commercial real estate relationships and are well known to both the market and our management team. Further, within the last week, we added a senior private banking professional, who will lead our private banking business, including expansion in the New York metro and Boston.","Second, over the last few quarters, we have built upon the depth of our cash management talent, and we are now starting to see the benefit of their efforts. In addition, we've been working to deepen our brokerage penetration throughout the footprint.","Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares or $53.7 million at a weighted average price of $11.93 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we repurchased 9 million shares or $110 million at a weighted average price of $12.24 per share. This results in approximately $6 million of annual dividend savings. We have 9 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.97% net interest margin for the quarter. As you'll recall, our first quarter net interest margin was 4.01%. Lower loan yields and higher levels of securities negatively impacted the margin by 8 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. The expanded securities portfolio relates to both the cash proceeds from the Citizens branch acquisition and deposit growth exceeding loan growth. This was partially offset by an 8-basis point improvement from cost recovery income related to settlements and payoffs in the acquired loan portfolio. Deposit costs, excluding fair value amortization, were 50 basis points, down from 55 basis points in the first quarter, which benefited the margin by 4 basis points.","The progress in reducing core deposit costs was offset by the expiration of the Bank of Smithtown and RiverBank fair value CD amortization, which negatively impacted the margin by approximately the same amount.","It is worth pointing out that the fair value amortization from the Danvers acquisition were run off in October 2012 and negatively impact our fourth quarter deposit cost by approximately 3 basis points.","Fair value amortization from the Citizens transaction is negligible with less than 1 basis point of positive impact on funding cost. In this rate environment, there continues to be opportunities to lower the deposit costs, particularly in the markets we have recently entered via acquisitions.","On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 3.89% in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and operating net interest margin is the cost recovery income, which we view as discrete and transactional in nature. Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.1 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2.5 years. Let me provide you a little more detail on the next slide.","Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $56 million, down from $60 million in the first quarter. The decline in accretion primarily related to Fin Fed, which accounted for $3 million of the difference. As we have said, we expect Fin Fed accretion is likely to expire at the end of this year, negatively impacting the net interest margin by approximately 5 basis points in 2013.","The carrying amount of acquired loans appeared in total $3 billion. During the quarter, there were reclassifications associated with our reassessments -- of the Butler and Smithtown portfolios. These reclassifications were driven by better-than-expected credit performance in these portfolios. For Butler, we reclassified $6.5 million from non-accretable to accretable. For Smithtown, we reclassified $2.4 million from non-accretable to accretable.","As with all prior reclasses, the amount of periodic accretion will be adjusted respectively over the remaining life of the underlying loans.","Slide 7 is a new slide that illustrates the amount of noncash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you see we booked total accretion of $56 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance of the acquired loan portfolio, gives us an effective yield of 6.97%. The weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.51%. This is the actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.97% effective yield and the weighted average coupon is 1.46%, which amounts to $11.7 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualizing this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the second quarter shows the 19 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion.","So if you want to think about our core underlying margin excluding the noncash accretion, it would be our operating net interest margin of 3.89% less than 19 basis points to 3.7%. The noncash accretion is equivalent to $0.02 a share this quarter, which is similar to prior quarters as shown on the right-hand side of the page. There has been some confusion about this topic, but we believe this slide helps set the record straight. We will continue to update this slide in the quarters ahead.","Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference bucket to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.","Slide 8 provides a breakdown of elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 11.2% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth for a total loan growth of 2.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized on a period-end basis. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $477 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas.","Originated commercial loans increased $374 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $143 million, $119 million and $111 million from C&I, equipment financing and commercial real estate, respectively. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight a few businesses that continue to outperform. Our equipment finance businesses, PCLC and People's United Equipment Finance, grew originated loans $48 million and $71 million, respectively, in the quarter. Since the acquisition of Financial Federal, now known as People's United Equipment Finance, closed in early 2010, the loan outstanding within this portfolio had consistently declined. However, over the last 2 quarters, we have seen this portfolio begin to grow.","Originated residential mortgages grew by $104 million or 13% annualized. The residential mortgage originations, approximately 57% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, and 55% of the pipeline is jumbo product. Second quarter 2012 originations average loan size is $574,000. Average FICO score for the second quarter originations was 755 with an average LTV of 65%.","Originated home equity loans increased by $11 million. Home equity loan closings totaled $164 million in commitments compared to $126 million in first quarter 2012. In terms of recent originations, the average line size the second quarter originations was $132,000. The average FICO score was 766 with an average combined loan-to-value of 58%. Consistent with our past practices, 100% of home equity loans are retail originated.","The acquired portfolio declined by $360 million or 43% on an annualized basis. Acquired loans are running off with a faster-than-anticipated rate for several reasons. First, the low interest rate environment is pushing customers to settle or pay off acquired loans relatively quickly. Second, the lack of prepayment fees in the acquired loan portfolios encouraged customers to refinance. This dynamic is due in part to the transactional nature of the acquired companies' portfolios, whereas our business is much more focused on building long-term relationships.","Further, there is a concentration of criticizing classified loans and runoffs that we are comfortable parting ways with. This decline in the acquired loan portfolio, coupled with a challenging economic and competitive environment, will likely pressure loan growth towards the mid-single digits for 2012.","You can see in Slide 9 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We have witnessed steady growth in both retail and commercial -- in both the retail and commercial segments with annualized total deposit growth of 3.6% in the quarter. Deposit growth was positively impacted by the Citizens transaction, which closed late in the quarter, but was partially offset by seasonal swing in Vermont municipal deposits.","Excluding the seasonal swing in municipal deposits, commercial deposit growth was 12.6% on an annualized basis. We have also seen an improvement in deposit mix with increases in non-interest-bearing and savings deposits of $25 million and $150 million, respectively, and $114 million decrease in time deposits. Average total deposits were up $346 million quarter-over-quarter.","The larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to increasing our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits with better utilization of the acquired Citizens branches.","Slide 10 shows that we continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 20% and 19%, respectively.","Slide 11 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $3.3 million from the first quarter. The income areas that demonstrated momentum included cash management and operating lease income, which increased $1.8 million and $1 million, respectively. Loan prepayment fees and gains on the sales of acquired loans also contributed to quarterly fee income growth, increasing by $1.6 million and $700,000.","As a reminder, our insurance business is seasonal. The second and fourth quarters tend to be weaker than the first and third quarters.","On Slide 12, you can see that our noninterest expense based improved to $206 million from $209 million last quarter. During the quarter, we experienced $3.6 million of non-operating expenses, $2 million of which related to the Citizens transaction.","As we think about noninterest expense, we are focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The second quarter operating expense base was $202.1 million, which included $700,000 related to the newly acquired Citizens branches and was down from $205.6 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was attributable to compensation benefit reductions, which declined $5 million to $103 million in the current quarter. Approximately $3 million of this decline relates to lower payroll taxes, which are typically higher in the first quarter as a result of the timing of annual incentive payments.","The third quarter will contain a full quarter of expenses for the newly acquired Citizens branches, which we estimate to be $7.8 million or an increase of $7.1 million from the second quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range of $825 million to $830 million. In the quarters ahead, we are committed to continuing to bring the absolute expense levels down on a pro forma basis.","On Slide 13, we provide a historical perspective on our efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio improved to 61.5% for the second quarter compared to 63.2% in the first quarter and 64.9% in the second quarter of 2011. Although exhibiting progress, the efficiency ratio has been negatively impacted by slower-than-anticipated loan growth and a decline in net interest margin. In particular, the reduction in the absolute level of interest rates from the end of last year was unexpected. And if interest rates remain at their current record low levels, we may see the timing of achieving our 55% efficiency ratio goal slipping into 2014.","As we discussed in the first quarter earnings call, the newly acquired Citizens branches are expected to cost us $0.01 per share in 2012, $0.02 per share in 2013 and breakeven in 2014. This transaction will also impact our reported efficiency ratio progress until we reach the breakeven point.","Next, we move on to an overview of recent expense initiatives. Given the difficult economic climate and the industry's increased regulatory and compliance burden, we established the expense management oversight committee in the fall of 2011. This committee is comprised of 3 senior executives: The Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer, that enables us to operate with a much more rigorous approach to expense control. This table outlines several key initiatives for 2012, as well as the new ones from this quarter to provide us an update on their current status. One of the goals of expense management oversight committee has been to focus on a longer planning horizon. For example, we now begin negotiating contracts 1 to 3 years in advance of expiration, which gives us a stronger negotiating position since the vendors recognize with this much lead time, we have the ability to switch providers.","We will provide an update on our cost reduction progress and the latest expense initiatives every quarter. It is important to note that we are still investing in the business while continuing to reduce expenses. The revenue initiatives that we have funded over the last year include the additional commercial relationship officers and support staff in the New York metro area, as well as additional talent in several key growth areas, including asset-based lending, mortgage warehouse lending, wealth management and private banking.","We are pleased to say these initiatives have produced sufficient increased revenues to cover their expenses and contribute to the bottom line with the exception of wealth management, which we expect to break even next year; and the acquired Citizens branches, which we project to break even in 2014.","Slides 15 and 16 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. NPAs decreased approximately $22 million to $295 million. Nonperforming assets at 1.67% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.","Looking at Slide 16, net charge-offs were 26 basis points compared to 22 basis points last quarter. Approximately 5 basis points of our charge-offs this quarter related to losses in acquired loans. Accordingly, net charge-offs and originated loan portfolio was effectively flat on a linked quarter basis. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets that stand at approximately 50% of our peers.","Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 48% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","On Slide 17, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.28% with a coverage ratio of 82% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $13.5 million in charge-offs, including $7.5 million at the previously established specific reserves and $4.6 million of additional allowance billed in response to loan growth.","Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 18, you can see our operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 97 basis points, up significantly from the first quarter. However, this includes approximately 6 basis points of improvement related to cost recovery income, which we regard as discrete and transactional. It's also worth noting that the operating return on average assets in the third quarter of 2011 was positively impacted by securities gains amounting to 8 basis points.  You'll recall that we took this action to reduce the premium on our books and protect against amortization exposure.","Making both of these adjustments, the chart would then illustrate consistent returns on average assets over the last 5 quarters of approximately 90 basis points. With this in mind, it's important to reflect upon the progress that we have made over the past 3 years.","As we have strengthened the earnings power of the franchise through the additions of key personnel, the expansion of key business lines and through the thoughtful deployment of capital, we have also absorbed the negative impact of regulatory reform to related higher cost of compliance and the impact of a prolonged low interest rate environment. Through all of this, we have nearly doubled our return on average assets from 49 basis points in the second quarter of 2009 to consistently performing over 90 basis points.","On Slide 19, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deployed capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 350 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with return on average tangible equity at 12.4%.","On Slide 20, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower throughout 2012. While we were aided by cost recovery income this quarter, steady loan and deposit growth, together with consistent share repurchase activity, has and will continue to reduce the dividend payout ratio.","On Slide 21, we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.5% and Tier 1 common at 13.6%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 11.3% as of the first quarter, respectively.","While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. This is the result of having a larger commercial loan portfolio, as well as smaller residential and securities portfolios than our peers. It is worth noting that we have spent some time with the Basel III proposal released on June 7, 2012. Given our strong capital levels, we do not anticipate any material impact when the new rules are implemented. However, it will take time to be precise about the impact on our capital levels because amongst other considerations, Basel III risk weighting will require loan specific risk-weighting adjustments.","Our game plan for successfully navigating the low interest rate environment includes growing loans and deposits, maintaining discipline on all asset repricing, lowering the cost of funds, lowering absolute expenses, growing fee income and maintaining excellent credit quality. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage.","This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Unknown Analyst","This is actually [indiscernible] for Steve. Kirk, could you give us some more color on the amortization of the deposits that detracted from the margin this quarter? It sounds like from your prepared comments, this is more one-offs. Should we expect the deposit costs? I think there were 107 in the quarter to normalize? Or do they ran at these levels?","Kirk W. Walters","The amortization that ran off in the quarter, which related to Bank of Smithtown and such did cost us about 4 basis points. It's a one-off, it's gone at that point -- at this point. And the other item that we tried to highlight was the only remaining amortization we have in our deposits relates to the Danvers acquisition, and that will cease to be around -- it goes away in the fourth quarter, which will cost us about another 4 basis points. So after those -- after the Danvers piece is gone, which will be a onetime, then we have no more left.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. So -- and then we should expect that 107 to kind of trail down from there in terms of your time deposit costs?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the -- remember this amortization is reducing the cost of the deposits, right? When we acquired the institutions, the time deposits were at a rate higher than where the market was so it's bringing it down. So like in this quarter, we actually brought our overall cost of deposits down 5 basis points, which was good progress, but the onetime basically offset it for this quarter.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Okay. So this is a new level for us. Could you speak to the rates that securities were added on in the quarter? And then should we expect you to build cash from here? It seems like the balance is pretty low at the end of the period.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. To the first question, we're investing predominantly in short tranche CMOs. They're coming on at about 140 basis points. So it's really a cash substitute, almost, that we're putting the money into. And we're keeping the duration of the securities portfolio right around 3 years. In terms of the second question, we do, on the deposit side, we do tend to hit sort of our seasonal lows during the summer as we come into the summer and then through August, and then it starts building from there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just hoping to get a little more color on this cost recovery income. I guess I heard you guys say it was discrete, transactional. I mean, is this something that was completely a one-off? Or, and if not, why would we see it again?","Kirk W. Walters","If look back in the fourth quarter, you'll see we had cost recovery income in that quarter as well. And this comes about when we do the reassessments, and it relates to loans that either are settled or paid off, and we in essence get proceeds in excess of the amount of the carrying value of the loans. So we've chosen the wording discrete and transactional carefully because it's not a case that it won't be -- that we won't see more of this as we go and the portfolios continued to run down. But it is erratic in terms of when it occurs and as it comes through.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Now, that makes sense. And then maybe just more -- taking a broader approach to the margin. I guess when you think about all the items in terms of what runs off, what doesn't, the resetting of your loan and security yields, pretty big drop. And then down to the 389 ex the cost recovery item. When you look forward over the rest of the year, any reason to assume that might not fall as much as it did or sort of outlook on them, please?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. I think this drop, the drop this quarter was a little bigger than what we would expect to see in the third and fourth quarters. As we have given guidance throughout the quarter, we do expect third and fourth quarter to continue to trickle down partially because of the rundown on the Fin Fed accretion and also the Danvers fair value amortization running off in the fourth quarter. But this quarter, we did lose about 8 basis points on loan repricings and another 5 on the securities side. And I would expect the securities side that we won't be probably adding as much to that portfolio as we go into the latter part of this year. So you wouldn't see the impact there. And on the loan side, we would certainly hope that, that would slow down from the level we experienced this quarter.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got you. But the 8 basis points talking about on the loan side does not have to do with acquisitions. That's just purely on -- originated loans?","Kirk W. Walters","That is strictly on originated loans. And remember, 40% of our loan portfolio floats. And as short LIBOR and short rates have come down, we've unfortunately had that pain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Kirk, just wanted to confirm, the $7.1 million of additional expenses that's coming on in the third quarter related to Citizens, the Citizens branches, is that -- did I hear that right? Is that just $7.1 million on a quarterly rate and we -- or how is that getting allocated? And did you give indication of that number in the past?","Kirk W. Walters","The first, the run rate which you can back into, because we did incur $700,000 expenses this quarter, is $7.8 million. We have given guidance in the past that we expect expenses to run in that range of probably $7.5 million to $8 million. And on the other side, obviously, we have revenues coming in from fees, the cash that we invested and as we're starting to generate loans, loans to the branches. So we have given the consistent guidance that we expected that it would cost us $0.01 a share this year, which includes the additional operating cost and $0.02 a share next. And by then, we would have built the deposit and asset generation capabilities to a place that we expected to break even in '14.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And just the $360 million of acquired loan runoff that you guys saw in this quarter, how does that break out between commercial, residential and CRE?","Kirk W. Walters","It is -- I mean, the biggest piece of -- and I don't have it right in front of me, but when you think about your runoff that occurs there, the biggest piece of it is in commercial. And it comes from Fin Fed, which rolls up into our C&I book. And in the commercial real estate, which is largely the Bank of Smithtown portfolios that are running down or we are in some cases pushing the loans out.","John P. Barnes","I think -- Collyn, Jack, I think, it's probably important to -- the perspective on that should be really is a mixed bag. We have interestingly, it's a competitive market, there are those that are paying off and refinancing, and our workout group continues to make very good progress on the troubled pieces as well. But definitely, the commercial real estate in the Smithtown portfolio is a big piece of that change.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And just a final question, on the mortgage banking line, I guess I was surprised it didn't go up more this quarter. What was the dynamic going on there? And what do you think we can expect for the remainder of the year?","Kirk W. Walters","Actually, the dynamic there is that we had a very good first quarter. And so I think activity was still very good in the quarter. Pipelines are at the same level and actually up a bit this quarter from where they were first. And so we, overall, have had good gains, good activity, and we would certainly expect to continue to see some strong quarters in the third and fourth in terms of activity there. But i think was more a function of first quarter being particularly strong and maybe a little better margins than anything in terms of this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","My first question has to deal with the provision outlook. This is the second quarter in a row, I think, where you've been slightly at or above the $10 million to $11 million range. How do you look at the provision in the upcoming quarters given your outlook for loan growth?","Kirk W. Walters","One of the things that we have tried to give a lot of color and detail on is sort of the building blocks of our provision, which, of course, includes charge-offs and charge-offs net of specifics and the loan growth. And so right now, we put away about $4.5 million for the loan build for this quarter. And certainly, as we hope for stronger loan growth in the third and fourth quarters, I would expect the provision to come up but could very conceivably run in that 10.5, 11 to 15 range depending on where the loan growth is. That's the biggest variability in the provision at this point.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then do you think you guys mentioned that the Fin Fed portfolio starting to show some growth. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing the way of growth, maybe the size of the loans and what the pipeline looks like and where your seeing -- geographically, where you're that growth?","John P. Barnes","Sure. This is Jack, Damon. From a -- without seeing all that detail in front of me, our discussions about that, we basically turned the corner several quarters ago and have started to grow the portfolio modestly and are really encouraged by that. Most of that growth is coming across their -- across the country and across their -- through their sales offices. And I'd say it's kind of modest within all their business lines. Construction had historically been the majority of their -- the biggest part of their portfolio and the majority of lending. That is why it had strong shrunk and run off at the pace that it did. Construction is not coming back in any strong way, but it's showing some increases in some of their longer-term relationships.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. Probably the other couple of things to add there is the long-haul trucking, which was another piece has shown a little better legs than both PCLC and Fin Fed, and the waste management business, we've added some people there, which has seen a little better activity too.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And my last question, just a point of clarification on the Citizens branch deal. So you expect to be breakeven, you said, in 2014? Does that mean that you have -- would have recovered the drag that you experienced in '12 and '13? Or that just mean that you will be in the black, so to speak?","Kirk W. Walters","That would just mean we'd be in the black for '14.","John P. Barnes","I just want to add. Can't help but add a little bit of color. We had a really great transition there and our focus coming off of that conversion and rebranding and the initial training in a very positive way, which we've already generated mortgage transactions and home equities and some really nice activity in our licensed sales brokerage group as well. So off to a great start.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just getting back to the margin discussion, if all the accretable yield is gone today and you had a 370 margin, what would your outlook for next year be? Trying to get your core margin dynamics excluding the impact of the transactions.","Kirk W. Walters","So let's make sure that we're all clear on terms because under the accounting, all accretable gone means literally those $3 billion of loans and all the income off them would've gone. So that's why you probably saw in our deck, Matt, that we put in a chart, it's on Page 7, that really looks at what this issue is because we have cash income that comes off the loan portfolio and we have noncash. So if you, the 370 reflects the fact that the noncash accretion or if you think about it, the purchase accounting mark, would have run off and be down at 370. Now, that's tied to the -- if you look at the underlying loans, it has some fairly -- it's going to take a while to get to that, but it would give you some clarity. So if you think about the 370, we would probably run in terms of the core margin because we do have some additional discount running off and a couple of other things in there. My guess would be somewhere between that 350 and 370 range depending on where interest rates are.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And if you just annualize the accretion and compare that to the total accretable yield. I mean it's about 5 years of run rate. I mean, is it fair to think it's gone a straight-line? How does it -- how could it change or be accelerated over time just all due to rates? I mean, it seems like it would be at the fastest level now just given where we are on the rate environment.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I think you have a couple of things. First, you have to, which give you the accretion for Fin Fed. That piece pretty well runs out by the end of this year or early next. And then the rest of it is bank-like type assets and really will be driven off of, as you mentioned, driven off of refinances, settlements, et cetera. So that's the estimate that you just gave there is certainly in the ballpark.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the reserve coverage, I believe in the past, you guys have talked about keeping the reserves around on the originated loans, around 100 basis points. Is that still a good benchmark? And you want to maintain above 100 basis points of coverage on originated loans?","Kirk W. Walters","I think what I really focus on in the reserves, and that's why we give all the color here, back in the deck on Page 17 is how that splits out. And in particular, the coverage on the commercial loans and the coverage in the residential. So right now, they're sitting around 1%. Could it hover a little bit below, or a little bit above depending on mix? I think the answer is, yes. But it has been hovering right around that 1% level. But I could say, what I really focused on is that commercial coverage historically, we've had very little in terms of charge-offs in the residential loans.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as we're thinking about expenses, the guidance of $825 million to $830 million for full year '12, is that operating or total expenses?","Kirk W. Walters","That is operating expenses.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And last question, can you give us a little update on the mortgage warehouse business, kind of balances there, yields there? And also just your gain on sale business that runs through the fee income portion of your P&L?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. So let me outstart on the gain on sale and then let Jack comment on the mortgage business. The gain on sale, I think we had another good solid quarter. It's down a little bit from the first quarter. A lot of that was that we had a very good first quarter. Spreads were a little wider than this quarter. But the pipelines itself remain very solid and, in fact, at this point, are up from where they were during the second quarter. So I think we'll continue to see good activity in the gain on sale of residential loans for -- as well as originating portfolio loans for the third and fourth quarters. In terms of the gain on sale of acquired loans, that's really sort of a hit or miss deal. This quarter, we happened to get some loan sales off and made a little money, but it can be fairly erratic. Let me turn it over to Jack to talk about the mortgage warehouse side.","John P. Barnes","So I think I would mention 2 things on the mortgage warehouse side. One is, we continue to see very steady good growth there. It is a little less than $350 million now as compared to a couple of hundred million dollars at the end of last year. So we're seeing a very, very nice pace in the buildout of the book. And we are enjoying the fact that they continue to maintain spreads in the most recent quarter, even saw a little bit of uptick.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, what were the spreads?","Kirk W. Walters","The spreads in that business tend to run between 3.25 to 3.75.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And actually, one last question. Could you just update us on your appetite for multifamily lending in the metro New York area, some of the rent-stabilized, rent-controlled type of product? I know you made a hire there recently, commercial real estate. Just talk about your observation and what you're seeing from multifamily yields and business?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. Let me, take a first crack and then Jack will chime in. I think it's important that what we have done is we've hired some experienced commercial real estate professionals, and we're not going into that market with just a bent that we're just doing multifamily. Certainly, multifamily will be in the mix. It'll be one of the things we'll be doing. But we will be doing all types of commercial real estate, and we have been doing that for quite a while in the market and have some fairly good footings in New York City, as well as the Metro areas as we sit here. The -- so overall, it's a business that we expect that we're going to build out. One that will be relationship-oriented and that we do have a good strong history on the commercial real estate side but also other products and offerings that we'll be able to lever in that market. So if you look at our commercial real estate as a whole, and the portfolio, the multifamily portion is relatively small when you consider it as a whole. So we do have some capacity if we find some interesting and good production to do. But I'd re-emphasize that we're looking at commercial real estate as a whole in the city.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Up next, we have Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I just want to be sure that I'm thinking about the margin correctly. I know we've talked on it. But as I think about the third quarter, basically, you start out of the gates losing the 8 basis points the was sort of non-core this quarter. And then beyond that, you all had about 8 basis points of core compression on the loan side and you're expecting something less than that in the third quarter. Is that the right way to think about the margin then? Is there any other impact from the Stop & Shop acquisition?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think as you start off the quarter. The 389 we've given as an operating already excludes the cost recovery income. That's already taken out. So you're basically starting with the 390 base. And as far as the third quarter goes, we don't have any headwinds of fair value adjustments. We are continuing to reduce our deposit cost. And the overall loan production and such, we obviously could continue to feel some repricing pressure. We had hoped it would be more similar to the first quarter where we weren't able to entirely offset it but at least got in the ballpark. As we get to the fourth quarter, we will give up 4 basis points with the Danvers fair value amortization running off. And so that could edge it down a bit more in terms of that portfolio. So a lot of that will continue to be our success in bringing the deposit cost down, and about 18% of our deposits are acquired deposits and the cost of those deposits is still around 90 basis points.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And obviously the Stop & Shop branches don't have a material impact one way or the other?","Kirk W. Walters","No. They actually come in -- yes, it's going to be almost a little bit of a -- the mid-40s is where they're at.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just one question on capital management. And I was just wondering if you could give us a sense for any M&A opportunities in footprint that you're seeing. Obviously, it sounds like a pretty tough operating environment. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for what you expect in terms of M&A opportunities upcoming.","John P. Barnes","It's been -- I would say the environment has been very quiet, and we remain focused on building the company through organic growth and doing the things that we have been doing in terms of capital deployment. We are building relationships as we've said in the past. I definitely feel like our relationships across the Northeast are stronger than they have been in the past, which is great. But it is a difficult environment as you point out, and I certainly don't have a sense that there's going to be any big piece in M&A.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Alonso with Macquarie.","Thomas Alonso - Macquarie Research","I just want to just walk through the expense stuff because it's been a long day and a lot of numbers. So we start with the $202.1 million. That goes up for -- by 7.1% for Citizens and then it walked down from there and you wound up in that $825 million to $830 million run rate. That's the way we should look at it?","Kirk W. Walters","That's correct. Now I'm sure it's been a long day for you. You got it right on.","Operator","Our next question is a follow up that comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I actually had 2 follow ups. First, regarding the comments, I don't want to beat a dead horse because there's a lot of talk about expenses. But you're going to push out the efficiency ratio because of the rate environment. I think we get that. Have you changed the expectation for dollars of cost saves? If you could maybe break it down for us in the dollar view and maybe what's in the run rate so far? I think that would be helpful.","Kirk W. Walters","The -- I think in terms of that analysis, it's one that we did in the second quarter investor book. We haven't put that out right here. But we gave a range before of expecting the Citizens deal closed that it would be toward the high end of the $830 million. And as we calculate based upon where our run rate and Citizens coming in at about 7.8%, that certainly translates into that range. As we have looked at this analysis before and thought about the level of expenses that we have taken out, if we had done nothing, and you may be referring to that one graph that we had in our investor book that we used during the second quarter, that when updated would indicate that if we had done nothing, we'd be at around $240 million. And obviously, we came in around $203 million. So a quarterly run rate which is a little over $30 million difference and -- or $38 million difference, which is well above what we thought we'd get in cost takeouts of the acquired entities. So we continue to work pretty hard, but we are obviously picking up these costs with the Citizens deal, which we strategically think is a very good transaction but one that is going to take us a little while to get it to a breakeven.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. And Kirk, maybe just one follow up. How much of the C&I loan growth was asset-based lending? And how's the pricing looking in the asset-based book?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. In the C&I loan growth, probably...","John P. Barnes","That book actually would be fairly modest growth during the quarter. We had, I think, as we pointed out in the commentary, good growth from our core markets, if you will, C&I lending across our footprint. We also had very nice growth in the PCLC unit and equipment finance. That was a nice pace. We had growth in the ABL unit, but I would say modest comparatively.","Kirk W. Walters","And, Steve, on the C&I side, probably the biggest contributor to the growth this quarter was the mortgage warehouse, which we had commented on earlier that had a pretty good quarter. In terms of the ABL business and the spreads in that business, they are -- they've continued to hang in really well from an overall standpoint, but we're looking at probably 250 to 300 basis points over, maybe 350.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you for joining us today.

My name is Andrew Kristiansen, I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial Incorporated. Please go ahead, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our first quarter 2017 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on the Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate everyone joining us today.","Let\u2019s get started by turning to the overview on Slide 2. We are pleased to report first quarter net income of $70.8 million, which increased 13% from a year ago. The quarter benefited from a 4 basis point improvement in the net interest margin from the fourth quarter, which was primarily attributable to loan yields our new business exceeding the total portfolio yield during the quarter.","Revenues grew on both a linked-quarter and year-over-year basis as a result of both higher net interest income and non-interest income. Revenue growth drove an efficiency ratio of 59.4%, which is comparable to the fourth quarter and an improvement from a year ago, despite modestly higher expenses.","We remain focused on enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and proactive expense management. Therefore, over time, we continue to expect further improvements in the efficiency ratio. Loan balances declined 1% on an annualized basis, primarily as a result of paydowns in the mortgage warehouse lending due to the rate driven nature of the business.","Excluding mortgage warehouse lending, the loan portfolio experienced an annualized growth of 3%, driven by favorable results in residential mortgage, as well as middle market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance of our diversified business mix. In addition, we remain successful gathering deposits across the franchise as evidenced by 9% annualized growth since year-end. As a reminder, the first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth.","Looking forward, at quarter-end loan pipelines were solid causing us to remain optimistic about our Commercial Lending segments, while expecting a somewhat lower level of growth in retail. Our view is that, our commercial customers are managing their businesses very thoughtfully in light of the current environment. While uncertainly exist due to unknowns around potential fiscal regulatory and tax law policy changes, we find clients remain hopeful and are looking to take advantage of growth opportunities as they arise.","With the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp completed, we are excited to further strengthen and expand People\u2019s United in the New York metro area. Experienced teams on both - from both companies have worked closely together throughout the integration process to ensure a seamless transition for clients. As planned, the core system conversion will take place in early May.","Howard Bluver, former President and CEO of Suffolk is now our New York market President. Howard\u2019s deep roots in the region, understanding of the local economy, and proven track record growth will greatly benefit the franchise. In addition, Suffolk Board of Directors has agreed to function as an Advisory Board to support integration, provide market insights, and help meet our growth expectations.","All of the expectations that we had at the announcement of the transaction have only been strengthened. They\u2019re optimistic about the revenue synergies of the combined company, particularly given the success achieved, while the two teams working together on client relationships in the months leading up to closing. We also remain committed to the cost saves we originally set forth.","Our team has identified and scheduled to close 13 branches, which include both Suffolk and People\u2019s locations. Overall, the positive economics of the transaction remain unchanged, and as such, we are very confident this combination of similar customer-focused cultures will create significant value for shareholders.","Suffolk is a terrific compliment to our already strong position in Metro New York area. Since the end of 2012, our New York franchise has experienced organic compound annual loan growth of 18%, making it our fastest growing market within the company\u2019s footprint over the period.","At quarter end we had $5.7 billion of loans in New York, which represent 19% of our total loan book and trails only Connecticut\u2019s $7.8 billion portfolio. The addition of Suffolk will bring New York\u2019s loan portfolio almost on par with Connecticut. And we expect in time it will become the largest market.","In New York, the experienced commercial real-estate team we brought in last year continues to generate increasing momentum. As such the headwind related to the decision to reduce the transactional portion of our multi-family portfolio has abated as new business originated from the full service relationships is offsetting approximately $20 million in monthly run up.","It\u2019s also important to note the strength of our Massachusetts franchise. Since the end of 2012 we have experienced again a compound annual loan growth of 8% in the Commonwealth, making in our second fastest growing market. At quarter end we had $5.5 billion of loans in Massachusetts. I spent time during the quarter visiting customers and employees in Massachusetts and came away impressed with the continued progress we were making and the momentum that we\u2019re generating, particularly in the Greater Boston area.","As we noted on our call in January, we opened a branch in Copley Square at the end of the last year, it\u2019s an excellent location to serve clients and has been very well received. In addition, during the quarter we began the on-boarding process for the Commonwealth and Massachusetts as we were selected to manage its core banking services, which is a significant win for People\u2019s United and should drive further opportunities for the Bank.","Finally, we are extremely pleased that Greenwich Associates recently recognized People\u2019s United for its commitment to service with 7, 2016 Excellence Awards in middle market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It\u2019s an honor to be recognized once again by Greenwich Associates and more importantly by our clients.","This way, I want to take a moment to thank our employees for their unwavering commitment to providing excellent exceptional service that delivers thoughtful, straightforward solutions that address the financial needs of our clients. This commitment in combination with the breadth of products and services we offer truly differentiate People\u2019s United in the market.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter\u2019s results in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Turning to Slide 3, net interest income increased $1.8 million or 1% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $7.8 million to net interest income due to higher yields on new business, re-pricing a floating rate loans, as well as slightly higher average balances. The largest offset to this increase was a $3.4 million reduction in net interest income resulting from two fewer calendar days in the first quarter. In addition, higher deposit cost and volumes lowered net interest income by $2.6 million.","Moving to Slide 4. Net interest margin of 282 basis points increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter. New loan volume favorably impacted the margin by 9 basis points as new business yields were higher than the total portfolio yield. The margin also benefited by 3 basis points from a higher yielding securities portfolio EBIT in part by a reduced level of premium amortization of mortgage-backed securities.","Two fewer calendar days in the first quarter unfavorably impacted the margin by 4 basis points, while higher deposit and borrowing costs collectively reduced the margin by another 4 basis points. Deposit costs were 36 basis points in the quarter, up 2 basis points from the fourth quarter.","On Slide 5 you can see period end loan balances dropped slightly from December 31st. The decrease of $58 million or 1% annualized was due to a $307 million reduction in the commercial portfolio, largely offset by strong retail growth of $249 million. On an average basis, the total loan portfolio was up slightly in the fourth quarter. Retail was driven by residential mortgage growth of $271 million, partially offset by lower balances in the consumer portfolio.","As we have grown our residential mortgage portfolio in the recent years, originations continued to be of outstanding quality. The portfolio\u2019s LTV and FICO metrics have remained consistent and the overwhelming majority of business retained continues to be hybrid, adjustable rate mortgages. For originated mortgages added to the portfolio during the quarter, the average LTV is 66% and the average FICO score is 750.","The decline in the commercial portfolio was primarily attributable to a lower C&I balance of $207 million. Within C&I, mortgage warehouse balances ended the quarter at $822 million, a $263 million decrease from year-end. As Jack mentioned earlier, this decline was attributable to paydowns due to the rate driven nature of this business. Excluding mortgage warehouse, the C&I portfolio grew 3% on an annualized basis.","Slide 6 shows the change in deposits since December 31. Deposits increased $645 million or 9% on an annualized basis during the quarter. While deposit growth occurred across all categories, the increase was primarily driven by higher interest bearing checking and money market balances. One a business segment basis, deposits in both retail and commercial increased during the quarter by $504 million and $141 million respectively. Once again, please note that first and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters for deposit growth.","On Slide 7 we look at non-interest income which increased $500,000 or 1% compared to the fourth quarter. During the quarter we sold approximately $500 million of lowering yielding short maturity securities, which resulted in net security losses of $15.7 million. These investment sales increased our asset sensitivity, which should be beneficial as the Fed further tightened monitory policy. We have partially repurchased securities to offset the loss carry income and expect all securities to be repurchased before quarter end. As such, the overall transaction is income neutral and enables us to hold smaller securities portfolio.","As you will recall, in the fourth quarter we reported net security losses of $6 million. Included in non-interest income was a $16.1 million gain from the exchange of an ownership interest in a legacy privately held investment. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter we reported a $6.3 million gain from the sale of a similar type investment.","Insurance revenues increased non-interest income by $2.3 million, reflecting the seasonal nature of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year. In addition, the quarter benefitted from higher investment management fee of $1.8 million, primarily attributable to a full quarter result of Gerstein Fisher. As you will recall, the acquisition of Gerstein Fisher closed in November of last year. The primary offset to these improvements was a $1.7 million lower net gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans.","On Slide 8 we illustrate the components of changes on non-interest expenses on a linked-quarter basis. First quarter expenses of $226.1 million increased $8.9 million or 4% from Q4. Included in the quarter\u2019s results were merger related and acquisition integration cost of $1.2 million compared to $1.6 million in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter, $700,000 of these costs are reported in professional and outside services, $400,000 in occupancy and equipment and the remainder in other.","Compensation and benefits excluding fourth quarter merger related and acquisition intervention costs of $700,000 increased $12.3 million. This result was primarily due to seasonally-higher payroll and benefit-related cost, as well as an increase in healthcare and incentive expenses. The line was also impacted by a higher salary expense, reflecting a full quarter of Gerstein Fisher, annual merit increases and new hires to support continued growth of the Bank. The primary offsets for this increase were lower regulatory assessments of $800,000, as well as lower professional and outside service expenses, excluding merger related and acquisition integration costs in both quarters of $600,000 due to the timing of certain projects.","Before moving to the next slide, I wanted to mention the income tax expense for the quarter reflect a $1 million benefit associated with the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting rules, which require the income tax effect of [Indiscernible] be recognized in income tax expense. For the period, this benefit had the effect of lowering the effective tax rate by 1%.","Turning to Slide 9, our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter was 59.4%, consistent with the fourth quarter and improved from the prior year quarter. As Jack referenced earlier, we continue to focus on enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and thoughtful expense management.","Maintaining excellent asset quality is an important lever in building sustainable long-term value. As such, we are pleased with our continued exceptional results as demonstrated on Slide 10. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 63 basis points remains well below our peer group and top 50 banks. First quarter net charge offs of 3 basis points remained at a very low level and continued to reflect the minimal loss content at our non-performing assets.","Moving to Slide 11, on a linked-quarter comparison, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity declined 5 basis points and 10 basis points respectively. Primarily due to the seasonally higher first quarter payroll and benefit related cost previously discussed. As displayed on the slide, compared to the first quarter of 2016 each of these return metrics showed improvement.","Continuing on to Slide 12, capital levels at both the holding company and the bank continued to be strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","Finally on Slide 13 we display our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. As you can see, we are a bit more asset sensitive compared to last quarter, primarily due to a smaller security portfolio resulting from the previously discussed investment sales. We remain well positioned for additional increases in interest rates. At quarter end 44% of our loan portfolio was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based consistent with year-end and up from 42% a year ago.","Before passing the call back to Jack, I wanted to briefly comment on our full year 2017 goals. As a reminder, the goals we outlined in January did not incorporate Suffolk. With the transaction closing less than three weeks ago, we are currently going through the purchase accounting process. As such, we are not going to provide an update to these goals to include Suffolk until the second quarter earnings call in order to fully complete the process.","However, we wanted to share some March 31st data points for Suffolk. The loan portfolio closed the quarter at $1.656 billion, while deposits were $1.852 billion. The inherent earning strength of Suffolk remains in place and joining People\u2019s United will only serve to enhance its potential going forward.","Jack Barnes","Thank you David. Our prudent capital management has enabled us to deliver shareholder value through the consistent return of capital, while still growing organically and investing strategically in the franchise. We remain committed to this strategy as evidenced by the Board declaring a common dividend for the 95th consecutive quarter, in addition we are pleased to announce the Board also voted to raise the common dividend to an annual rate of $0.69 per share, this marks the 24th consecutive year of common dividend has been increased.","This concludes our presentation. Now I\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your question. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll be taking our first question for the day from the line of Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jared Shaw","Hi, good morning.","Jack Barnes","Good morning Jared.","David Rosato","Good morning.","Jared Shaw","Just - if you could share a little bit on the loan portfolio and some of the opportunities as we look post Suffolk. Could you give us an update on where you were in terms of commercial real-estate concentration for the quarter? And then as we look to see growth going through the rest of the year, do you think that there is an opportunity to expand as some of the competitors have pulled back from the CRE market? And if you could also then talk to what the investors are looking for in terms of cap rates and if that\u2019s dramatically changed?","Jack Barnes","Sure. So we are below the 300% of capital, somewhere around 285% in terms of commercial real-estate concentration levels, so we\u2019re not concerned about that. And as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, we have enhanced risk management around the monitoring of that portfolio and have not been concerned when we move above 300%, so just so everybody has kind of that perspective on our sense of that.","We see good potential growth in the commercial real-estate portfolio. Our strongest market pipeline right now are in New York, particularly revolving around the new team we have there and Connecticut where we have a lot of long-standing strong relationships and again, a good solid pipeline.","The rest of the markets I\u2019d say are kind of in line with the historical perspective. And I would say just generally to your question about, I think cap rates and where the market is, it feels like there is no significant change in People\u2019s appetite for investment with good properties and we focus on good operators with a lot of experience and People will continue to invest.","Jared Shaw","Thanks. And if I could just ask one additional question. As you look at your asset sensitivity and post the Suffolk deal, should we expect to see maybe opportunities for more restructuring on the securities book on either the Suffolk book or your book and then what would you expect, would you expect a big change in your pro forma asset sensitivity post the conversion or integration?","David Rosato","Yes. Hi Jared, it\u2019s David. No, the most - the components of the Suffolk portfolio that we liked, we\u2019ve taken onboard, there are few asset classes that were similar to ours and the others we have since exited. But the - again, they are only 5% of our asset size, so it\u2019s not going to have a noticeable impact on our overall interest rate risk profile. So you should expect us to maintain sensitivity very similar to what we have. I would note that you saw an uptick in sensitivity this quarter, that was primarily due to the sales of securities in the first quarter that approximately $500 million of short senior notes delivered.","Jared Shaw","Okay, thanks. And then just finally, at 40 - you are going to be closer to the $50 billion threshold now Suffolk, what\u2019s the appetite for additional M&A versus organic growth in terms of passing the $50 billion threshold?","David Rosato","We continue to prepare to cross $50 billion, as we\u2019ve described in the past we\u2019re making good progress on that front. And as we\u2019ve said again in the past, if the right opportunity were to come along in M&A, then we would be certainly looking to respond to that and dealing with the process with our regulators, having the dialogue about that potential and feel good about having a good solid dialog with the regulators about that and so we wouldn\u2019t be shying away from a conversation just because of the $50 billion mark.","Jared Shaw","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","David Rosato","Sure.","Jack Barnes","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Casey Haire","Thanks, good morning guys. Dave, I wanted to follow-up on the securities restructure, can you just give us a sense as to when this took place in the quarter? And then also, maybe disaggregate how much of the uptick in the securities portfolio yield was from premium am and from the restructuring? Just trying to get a sense of where that securities yield could potentially go in the next quarter?","David Rosato","Sure. First of all, the sales were late in the first quarter. Again, what we emphasized was short maturity low yielding, so the average yield on that portfolio was about 133 and after funding cost it only had about a 35 basis point positive spread. Our strategy will be exactly the same as what we talked about three months ago when we did this in the first or in the fourth quarter is to replace that income with higher-yielding securities, which allows us to shrink the securities portfolio, it\u2019s additive to capital, it\u2019s additive to the margin, but it\u2019s income neutral. The overall effect on the yield of the securities portfolio was about 3 basis points or so.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. Alright and then just switching to the loan growth front, you guys are tracking pretty nicely towards your - towards the bottom end of your loan growth guide for the year even with the mortgage warehouse downdraft, I\u2019m just - you know is that in line with your thinking and do you see stability in the mortgage warehouse lines going forward or is there further pressure there?","Jack Barnes","Casey, this is Jack. Yes, we\u2019re basically feeling kind of exactly as you described. The utilization on the mortgage warehouse lines that dropped to somewhere in the mid-40% range and that\u2019s a low point for sure. And we would think it\u2019s going to be somewhere in the range, maintain the balance that it\u2019s - where it is now. We didn\u2019t plan on the balances that were very different from where we are now. So, in terms of expectations on our garden, I think it\u2019s kind of in line with that. I\u2019ve described a little bit about the three pipelines, talking with Jared, and I would reinforce that on the C&I side, I think particularly the Boston area and Connecticut have very solid opportunities in front of us, so we\u2019re feeling fine about where we are.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. Just one last one from me, Dave, on the fee guide, it looks like it\u2019s coming in a little light this quarter, tracking below that 5% to 7% guide, are you guys still feeling good about that? I mean, it doesn\u2019t seem like you are going to need a very steep ramp in the remaining three quarters here to hit the low-end of that guide.","David Rosato","Casey, thank you, it\u2019s David. We\u2019re still comfortable with the guidance that we provided. The first quarter from, both a loan origination and a fee income perspective was slow season, but seasonally slow, not unlike last year. So, we would expect to see a ramp in most of the line items as the year progresses and we\u2019ll provide an update with the Suffolk guidance next quarter; but where we stand today, we\u2019re still comfortable with the guidance.","Jack Barnes","The day count impact...","David Rosato","Yes, you know in first quarter two fewer calendar days, three fewer business days did have an impact across a lot of those businesses and the lower originations actually affected, for example, our FX business, our customer interest rate swap business et cetera and we feel fine about those as the year unfolds.","Casey Haire","Okay, great. I mean it does look like that that other income line net of the securities or the one-time gain was a little low. Maybe there was some, I don\u2019t know if there was any noise in there, but that did seem like you underwent there.","David Rosato","It\u2019s struck down a little over $1.5 million quarter-over-quarter once you make the adjustment for the security - the one times.","Casey Haire","Okay, great, thanks.","David Rosato","You\u2019re welcome.","Jack Barnes","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll be taking our next question from the line of Steven Alexopolous from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Steven Alexopolous","Hey, good morning everyone.","Jack Barnes","Good morning.","David Rosato","Good morning Steve.","Steven Alexopolous","I want to start on the efficiency ratio. You guys have chopped quite a bit of wood on the expense front over the past few years. I\u2019m curious how much is left to do on the expense side and are we getting closer to the point where you really need to start seeing stronger revenue growth to start moving the efficiency ratio needle?","Jack Barnes","Yes, Steve, I mean as we\u2019ve said on the expense front, it\u2019s working at it every day and working at our expense management process, but there are certainly no large unique efforts there that we have planned. You know you remember in - it seems like 2013, 2014, 2015 we closed a lot of branches, particularly in places where we had either dense, density locations Connecticut, but also places where we acquired banks in the same market like in Boston. So we\u2019ve made a lot of promise on that front. We continue to work at that kind of thing, but we - it won\u2019t be any big 10 or 15 at a time. It will be continuing to work at it over time.","So, on the expense front, we just continue to work to realize saves wherever we can. More about automating processes, you know continuing to put in technology to improve efficiency where we can. It is that I think mostly a revenue opportunity for us and there are just many, many markets New York and Massachusetts and many business lines, you know ABL, equipment finance, large corporate where we\u2019ve grown businesses, but they have plenty of potential to continue to grow and as we do that, we expect to see revenue expansion.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay, that\u2019s helpful color. And maybe for David on the deposit side, overall deposit cost were up only modestly in the quarter. Can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing from a local markets view as you go out there and raise deposits and how are you thinking about deposit data\u2019s for the rest of the year?","David Rosato","Sure. The - we haven\u2019t really seen any noticeable customer demand or push for higher deposit costs. The 2 basis point linked-quarter increase was really driven by our broker deposits, which are essentially Fed funds index type deposits.","From a - if I look across the retail businesses and the commercial businesses, the only segment where we\u2019ve really seen any type of pressure is very small subset of the largest Government banking client. So that would be both the state money that we have in a few states. The savviest of that client vertical and so that\u2019s - we\u2019ve seen a little bit there, but your bread and butter municipality across our franchise, we have not.","On the retail side, we\u2019re seeing a few more banks run CD specials across the market. Not incredibly impressive, but modestly more aggressive than we\u2019ve seen over in the past few quarters. But again, our increase in deposits really wasn\u2019t across our core customer base, it was across the broker deposits that we have on the balance sheet.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay, does that mean you expect betas to remain very low from the rest of the year?","David Rosato","Yes, so if you think about betas, we\u2019ve had now 325 point rate increases, so 75 basis points and our deposit costs are up 2 basis points. If you go to our very low end 33, so you can say we\u2019re up 3 basis points for a 75 basis point move. We\u2019re - you know addition of 0.04. We won\u2019t think that when the piece of Fed moves becomes closer together and more consistent, if we get to that, you\u2019re going to see increasing pressure on betas and we would expect them to slowly gravitate towards more normal betas, which I would say for the industry in aggregate it\u2019s probably around a 0.05 or so. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re close to that point by any means right now.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay. That\u2019s really great color. If I could squeeze one more and sorry if I missed it. On the mortgage warehouse what was the split of purchase and refi in the quarter?","David Rosato","In the mortgage warehouse business or in our business.","Steven Alexopolous","Yes, no, in the mortgage warehouse business.","David Rosato","I don\u2019t - I would say, it was probably close to 50-50 off the top of my head. I don\u2019t have that in front of me Steve.","Jack Barnes","I think it was a little bit more with the refi score still little lower, I think 50%.","David Rosato","Yes, maybe, yeah. What we\u2019re seeing generally in our Bank and in the business, you know there is a much, much more talk about purchase activity and we\u2019re seeing it in the numbers and of course the refi applications have dropped pretty considerably.","Steven Alexopolous","Okay. Have you historically been about 50-50 in that business?","David Rosato","I would say no, you know as that business goes, in the last few years it was much higher refi and slower purchase. So, the expectation in the business is that as the economy improves and the demand for housing stock improves or increases, I should say then the purchases will pick up and it is picking up both in our footprint, in our retail bank and in that business.","Jack Barnes","Steve, just to add a little more color to that. So, not our mortgage warehouse business, but our retail business in the first quarter 65% of the volume was refinanced, 35% purchased. I would add to that though that just in this quarter we\u2019ve seen the purchase component creep up, which is a normal seasonality.","Steven Alexopolous","Yes, okay, thanks for the color guys.","Jack Barnes","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thank you. Just going back to the commercial real estate, because it seems like you are somewhat bullish about the growth outlook there. Obviously just - there is still concerns about credit quality in the industry, right in underwriting terms of the industry and we\u2019ve seen some indications that the terms have gotten better. From your experience like is that - how meaningful are those industry changes and is that having any noticeable impact on your ability to grow commercial real estate? Thanks.","Jack Barnes","I would say that challenge generally is a challenge for us. We are pretty firm in our underwriting approach and you can see that in our results over time, including right now the level of non-performers and delinquency and charge off in our CRE portfolio is minimal. So, we kind of always deal with a pressure from a competitor that will do something that we\u2019re are not willing to. I would say on the larger properties, most of our competition is the - or moderate to larger banks and the discipline around underwriting is there, you know pretty consistent with ours. So, I don\u2019t think there is a big problem from my perspective generally in the industry.","Locally, smaller banks often are more aggressive with a borrower and a property that they feel they know very well and they will work hard to either keep or win that type of business. So, that\u2019s our biggest challenge on the competitive front.","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay and then, the other question. Just in terms of updates on the timing of potential merger costs over the next three quarters? Thanks.","David Rosato","You don\u2019t see most of those costs next quarter, but some will - in the second quarter, but some will leak over into the third quarter as well.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Provided fourth quarter it\u2019s totally gone or done?","David Rosato","Yes, it should be, except for maybe a few items there, but\u2026","Ken Zerbe","Great. Okay, thank you.","David Rosato","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Matthew Breese","Good morning everybody. Just going back to the securities portfolio for a second, I just wanted to get a sense for how we should be thinking about modeling it from a size perspective and are the restructurings done and maybe said in another way, what percentage of assets would you like to hold that securities portfolio at?","David Rosato","It is a question of whether we would expect any more restructurings, the answer - that short answer to that would be no. We are not foreseeing that. And I should add if I wasn\u2019t clear to Jared\u2019s first question, any restructuring having to do with the Suffolk portfolio has also been completed. What we are really trying to do is, recognize that we are in a slowly rising interest rate environment. We believe that even though some of the timing of the next Fed news in the last weeks has started to leak out of the market. The first quarter was - generally had expectation due to three more Fed tightening and we\u2019ve seen a flatter yield curve. So we traditionally have always wanted a smaller securities portfolio than our peer group in the last couple years, when rates have been down that has crept up closer to the peer group, but still below.","So what we are trying to do going forward in the environment that we foresee is just to run a smaller portfolio or a small of a portfolio as we can, while still generating the proper amount of income, as well as to manage our rate sensitivity. So, I wouldn\u2019t look for all of these loans to go back or all of these securities to be going back on the balance sheet anytime soon.","And the other important point in this is, similar to what we did last quarter, the bonds that will be repurchased will cover the income that was given up from the sales. So it\u2019s income neutral transactions.","Matthew Breese","Understood, okay. And then going to expenses, the $225 million core number, is that a good number to work off of for the rest of the year? And as a follow-up to that, how do you think that\u2019ll trend in 2Q and 3Q, will there be any pullback from changes in seasonality?","David Rosato","Well, as you know, expansions are historically elevated in the first quarter, so if you make that adjustment and then - use that as the run rate for the year, I would say, you would be underestimating the expansions that we\u2019ll - we saw. Some of our expansions were a little subdued in the first quarter due to the timing of projects. We do expect a little bit expense build over the course of the year, plus don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ll be adding Suffolk into the mix and then we will be updating guidance from the beginning of July.","Matthew Breese","Okay. Is it sufficed to say that, you know excluding Suffolk, expect it should head towards the upper end of your guidance for the year, the $915 million number?","David Rosato","I wouldn\u2019t say the upper end of the guidance, I would say we are still comfortable with the guidance that we provided three months ago.","Matthew Breese","Okay. And then on the margin, considering the twist scenario and how the 10-year has moved over the past several weeks, how will that impact things over the course of the year, now with the 10-year back to 220?","David Rosato","If the yield curve stays flat or goes flatter, it\u2019s not good for the margin. The - we modeled one - in our original guidance, 125 basis point increase in the middle of the year and it\u2019s come earlier obviously and it seems like we might get another one this year, so if you put that together that\u2019s positive to the margin. Our guidance for the margin was 280 to 290 first quarter which is usually a lower quarter, because at day count we were at 282. So, if rates continue to rise, if the yield curve does not flat further, we\u2019re comfortable with that guidance and think we may wind up gravitating towards the upper end of that all else equal.","But really the key as you are pointing out in your question is the optimum shape of the yield curve and we\u2019ve seen a flattening of the yield curve in the first quarter, quite considerably the 10-year is down about 15 basis points, 12\/31 to 3\/31 and the two-year is up probably five - maybe even 5 to 7 basis points and Fed funds are up 25.","Matthew Breese","Great. Understood. Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.","Jack Barnes","You\u2019re welcome Matt.","Operator","We\u2019ll be taking our next question from the line of Collyn Gilbert from KBW. Your line is open.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks, good morning gentlemen.","Jack Barnes","Good morning.","David Rosato","Good morning.","Collyn Gilbert","So, just to talk quickly on the credit side, the uptick in commercial NPLs and the equipment finance and C&I portfolio, what was driving that and kind of what\u2019s your outlook there?","Jack Barnes","Really very isolated on a few credits, just unique situations and not concerned about that at all in terms of the overall outlook. So we just had a transportation related company that had operating issues.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay. And just tying to that, you guys had provided guidance at the end of the year for provision running in the $40 million to $50 million range for 2017. Obviously coming in much slower than that on an annualized basis, are you still holding to that same guidance then which would suggest a bump up in the provision as we go out through the year?","Jack Barnes","Yes, we are right now obviously had very good performance in the quarter and we have in the last number of quarters, so we are thinking really two things, we look at net charge-offs in the quarter and then we look at loan growth and this quarter\u2019s level of provisioning was tied to both of those. As we moved through the year, we expect continued strong credit performance and the piece of our loan growth and provisioning around the growth of the portfolio will kind of determine where we end up in that range, that\u2019s makes sense, Collyn?","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, yep, yep, that\u2019s helpful, okay. And then just on the investments that you guys have been able to monetize and I apologize if you may have done over this last quarter, but can you just remind us of what the overall pool is of these investments and maybe what your outlook is for future themes from here?","David Rosato","Sure Collyn, it\u2019s David. There is really nothing left of substance that\u2019s similar to what happened in the last two quarters. Last - at year around that was a legacy People\u2019s United investment, this quarter we are actually one investment that came from two different acquired banks over time. And really nothing else that we see on the horizon.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, okay that\u2019s helpful. And then, just bigger picture on the M&A front, Jack, I mean you indicated that obviously you approaching $50 billion is not causing you to shy away from M&A. Would your preference be, I mean given where you guys, how much you\u2019ve built the infrastructure and the overall organization over the years, would your preference be at this point to do a larger deal if it should present itself rather than kind of some of the smaller ones or how do you think about the size of M&A now as we look out over the next few years?","Jack Barnes","I\u2019ll speak to them and I think I guess just for the record, my strong preference would be for Congress to move the $50 billion mark, $250 billion or something. I feel the weight with that, but I\u2019m still hopeful that something will happen on that front. So, on the M&A front, I would continue to have everybody think about us being opportunistic and so whether it\u2019s something like Suffolk that isn\u2019t large but is meaningful in terms of improving our presence in the market and strengthening our position, bringing on some really talented folks and we really think that that deal is bigger than it looks when you think of all of the potential it has to help us move forward.","And so whether it\u2019s something that\u2019s $2 billion or $2.5 billion or a $10 billion, it really is about what will it do for us, how good is the opportunity? How accretive is it? What does it do for the shareholder? It\u2019s not really necessarily about size.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one final question tied to that. Are you guys thinking about Long Island any differently now or your approach as you integrate Suffolk, given the fact that Sterling is going to be moving out on to the Island with Historia, which is a different competitor certainly than what NYD would have been. I mean, just curious to get your thoughts on if you\u2019re thinking about that and is it of any differently or how - what your outlook is there for Long Island?","Jack Barnes","Yes, so I would say, the way we are thinking about, we\u2019re bring in 22 relationship managers and all of their customers into the bank, those folks are middle-market lenders, C&I lenders and business bankers and some commercial real-estate. So we are strengthening our relationship manager, a presence on the Island. We\u2019ve got great footprint, convenience to the customers. Our brand is stronger, I think, every day. We\u2019ve got a lot of marketing going on right now actually as we move through the integration.","And so we see opportunity even with the story of Sterling and other activity, if you really think about the Island, Chase is very big out there, Capital One, TD, [Indiscernible], there is a lot of competition, very good competition and we\u2019ve been facing that since we started establishing our presence there in 2010. And so we steadily build our presence there and as we kind of shared in the comments we made, we\u2019ve grown nicely in New York and continue to make good progress not only there, but in Westchester County and then Manhattan. So we feel really good about what we\u2019re doing. We like to move faster, we always want to move faster and we\u2019re trying to do that, looking forward to the Suffolk folks joining us and trying to do exactly that.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. Okay, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks gentlemen.","Jack Barnes","Thank you","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions in the queue. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Barnes for closing remark.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, our first quarter performance provided a solid start to the year, as referenced by and reflected in enhanced year-over-year profitability, improvement in the net interest margin, loan yields on new business outpacing total portfolio yield, continued revenue growth, further success gathering deposits, and sustained and exceptional asset quality.","In addition, with the acquisition of Suffolk completed, we\u2019re very optimistic about the opportunities for further strengthening and growth of our franchise in the New York Metro market. Thank you all very much for your interest in People\u2019s United and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People\u2019s United Financial Incorporated. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our first quarter 2018 results are Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, Commercial Banking; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide one of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning. We appreciate everyone joining us today.","Let\u2019s begin by turning to the first quarter overview on slide two. Our first quarter performance demonstrates our success in enhancing earnings power of the Company while continuing to build the franchise for the long-term. We are pleased to report record quarterly net income of $107.9 million or $0.30 per common share and return on average tangible common equity of 13.8%, an increase of 420 basis points from a year-ago. We continue to execute on revenue-producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions. As such, we are also pleased, total revenues of $386 million increased 2% from the fourth quarter and 16% from the year-ago, driven by both higher net interest income and fee income.","The net interest margin was 3.05%, a 2 basis-point decline from the fourth quarter, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax-preferenced items in our C&I portfolio as well as two fewer calendar days in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and upward repricing of floating-rate loans. On a year-over-year comparison, net interest margin was up 23 basis points.","While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only 2% from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling costs. The seasonality in expenses and the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully taxable equivalent revenues were the primary drivers of the increase in the efficiency ratio on a linked-quarter basis.","Average loan balances were $32.1 billion for the quarter, a decline of less than 1% linked-quarter. While the first quarter is typically seasonally slower period for loan growth, production was also unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios. Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated pay-offs.","In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected run-off in the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. Despite the some modest decline in the loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines, at quarter-end, we remain confident that Company can achieve the 2018 growth goal of 4$ to 6% that we announced in January.","Moving on to deposits. Average balances were $32.8 billion for the quarter, also a decline of less than 1% from the fourth quarter. We remain focused on gathering deposits across both, our retail and commercial businesses.","As I discussed last quarter, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve clients. We are also investing in digital marketing capabilities with new tools and the usage of data. We are aligning technology-based offerings with our expert bankers across business lines including mobile and online capabilities putting human interaction at the center. Therefore, we were excited to launch our new retail checking campaign in February, which is themed where the technology is as helpful as the people. The campaign is promoting quality of our customer service and the relevant effectiveness and convenience of our technology. Also during the quarter, Greenwich Associates once again recognized People\u2019s United for its commitment to service with five excellence awards in middle market banking, both nationally and in the Northeast. It\u2019s an honor to be recognized as it reflects the success of our unwavering commitment to service and the ability to offer a full suite of products that helps clients achieve their financial goals. Our solutions-oriented approach to banking continues to differentiate People\u2019s United.","Finally, our prudent capital management has enabled us to grow the business organically and invest strategically in the franchise, while also providing a consistent cash return capital to shareholders. As such, we are proud to announce the Company\u2019s 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase. We remain committed to our strategy of annually increasing the common dividend while also continuing to reduce our common dividend payout ratio by growing earnings.","It\u2019s important to note that the common dividend payout ratio was 56.3% for the first quarter, down from 78.3% a year ago.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss the first quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack.","Turning to slide three. Net interest income of $295.8 million increased $3.5 million or 1% on a linked-quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed $10.7 million of the increase to net interest income due to higher yields on new business and the upward repricing of floating rate loans. Net interest income also benefited $2.7 million from higher average balances in the securities portfolio. The largest offset to these increases was a $6.1 million reduction in net interest income from higher deposit and borrowings costs. In addition, two fewer calendar days in the quarter lowered net interest income by $3.8 million.","As displayed slide four, net interest margin of 3.05% was 2 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Excluding the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax-preferenced items in the C&I portfolio, net interest margin increased 4 basis points from the fourth quarter. Net interest margin continues to benefit from the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 10 basis points as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. Conversely, two fewer calendar days in the first quarter reduced the margin by 4 basis points while higher deposit and borrowings costs collectively lowered the margin by another 6 basis points. In addition, a lower securities portfolio yield decreased the margin by 2 basis points.","Turning to loans on slide five. Average balances were $32.1 billion, down $175 million or less than 1% linked-quarter. Average balance growth of a $120 million in equipment financing and $31 million in residential mortgage was offset by lower average balances of $168 million in commercial real estate, $114 million in C&I, and $44 million in home equity and other consumer.","We continue to be very pleased with the addition of LEAF as their average loan balance grew 8% from the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations. Period-end loans were also $32.1 billion, down $471 million or 1% linked-quarter.","As Jack referenced earlier, loan production during the quarter was unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios. Commercial real estate balances were lower, primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition, and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected run-off of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. Run-off from the New York multi-family portfolio was $145 million in the first quarter which was higher than our quarterly expectation due to one relationship with 10 loans totaling $54 million paying off earlier in the year than anticipated. Average deposit balances for the first quarter were $32.8 billion, down $54 million or less than 1% linked-quarter.","As you can see on slide six, growth in interesting-bearing checking and money market balances of $121 million was offset by $175 million in lower average balances collectively across savings, non-interest-bearing and time deposits.","Period-end deposits were $32.9 billion, down $163 million or less than 1% linked-quarter, driven by $199 million decrease in time balances and a $64 million decrease in non-interest bearing deposits. The declines were partially offset by growth in interest-bearing checking and money market balance of $68 million as well as savings balances of $32 million.","Deposit costs were up 3 basis points for the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling deposit costs, as demonstrated by interest-bearing deposit beta of 16% since the beginning of the current cycle of increasing interest rates. In comparison, our loan yield data is 26% during the same period.","Looking at slide seven, non-interest income of $90.4 million increased $3.1 million or 4% on a linked-quarter basis. As you will recall, non-interest income in the fourth quarter included $10 million of net security losses incurred as a tax planning strategy, which were offset by a tax benefit associated with tax reform. Non-interest income in the first quarter benefitted from $2.9 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance removals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.","Commercial banking lending fees were also up $1.8 million in the quarter, primarily driven by higher C&I loan prepayment fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $3.7 million decline in customer interest rate swap income which had a very strong fourth quarter. As a reminder, the other non-interest income line item in the fourth quarter benefitted from a $2.6 million gain on the sale of two acquired loans as well as a $1.2 million gain from the sale of - Suffolk\u2019s headquarters building in Riverhead, Long Island.","On slide eight, non-interest expense of $243.5 million, increased $3.8 million or 2% from the fourth quarter. The first quarter did not have any merger-related expenses, while the fourth quarter included $1.6 million of merger-related expenses with $1 million in professional and outside services and $600,000 in compensation and benefits. Excluding merger-related expenses, non-interest expenses increased $5.4 million in the fourth quarter. The primary driver of this increase was $8.6 million in higher compensation and benefits, primarily reflecting seasonally higher payroll and benefit-related costs. Additionally, professional and outside services were up $900,000 from the fourth quarter. The largest offset to these increases was $2.8 million in lower amortization of core deposit intangibles relating to certain acquisitions which were fully amortized as of year-end 2017, resolving in approximately a $2.6 million lower quarterly expense in 2018. This reduction was contemplated in our full-year 2018 expense goal, provided in January. Additionally, regulatory assessments were $1.3 million lower in the fourth quarter due in part to a reduction in average assets.","Turning to slide nine, the efficiency ratio of 59.4% increased 330 basis points from the fourth quarter but was flat compared to a year-ago. As Jack described in his remarks, the seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs in the first quarter as well as the unfavorable impact of tax reform on fully tax equivalent revenues were the primary reason the efficiency ratio increased from the fourth quarter.","Tax reform added approximately 90 basis points to the efficiency ratio in the first quarter as a result of the lower FTE adjustment to net interest income while seasonally higher payroll and benefit costs added approximately 150 basis points.","Looking forward, we remain committed to enhancing operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.","Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on slide 10. Originated non-performing assets as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 58 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 6 basis points improved 2 basis points from an already low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.","Moving on to slide 11. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving our profitability metrics. Return on average assets of 98 basis points improved 28 basis points from a year-ago while return on average tangible common equity of 13.8% increased 420 basis points over the same period. As we continue to build the earnings power of the Company, we expect further improvement in these metrics.","Continuing on to slide 12. Capital ratios remained strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management. In addition, capital ratios were favorably impacted by approximately 11 basis points due to the reclassification of $38 million from AOCI to retained earnings, representing the stranded tax effects arising as a result of tax reform.","The final slide on page 13 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twist. We remain asset sensitive in spite of rising interest rates and we continue to be well-positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 43% of our loan portfolio at quarter-end was either one-month LIBOR or prime-based.","Now, we will be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jared Shaw","Hi. Good morning. Just on the -- if we could start on the multi-family portfolio, what is the current balance there? And do you think that -- are you still that that\u2019s the faster pace of pay down as we come into the second quarter, do you think that you could be out of that portfolio maybe faster than you had originally expected?","David Rosato","Jared, it\u2019s David. No. Those loans were scheduled to pay off in the third quarter this year and they paid off late in March. So, our original guidance that we gave back in January, payoff of $250 million to $300 million is still our current expectation?","Jack Barnes","Yes. The $1,250 million is the outstanding balance now.","Jared Shaw","Okay. and then as we look at the capital levels here, understanding the benefit you got from the tax reform of 11 basis points, do you feel comfortable with sort of GCE ratio just below the 8%, the regulatory capital ratio is here, and would you feel comfortable doing another deal with the capital here, keeping in mind that we\u2019re probably still waiting for regulatory reform first?","David Rosato","Well, we had a nice capital build in the quarter, part of it we talked to the 11 basis points I just mentioned. Capital levels were a little higher than we expected just because the size of the balance sheet was a little smaller than expected. Our expectation would be that if we do have the opportunity to acquire in the banking space, it would most likely be a 100% stock deal. So, in no way would we think that our capital levels would be an issue around any type of acquisition.","Jared Shaw","Great. And then, just finally, I guess, on M&A. Have you heard an increase at all on the level of interest on the part of potential sellers or people waiting for us to see what happens in Washington?","Jack Barnes","This is Jack. Jared, I think there is certainly some of that -- there is as always I guess, in my mind a mix of opportunities and challenges for the people that we have relationships with and that we talk to. And rates are coming up. People are hopeful about the economy. And that makes them optimistic about progress. But, on the other hand, there is a lot of challenges around growing deposits, spending money on technologies that weigh on people. So, I think we are very anxious waiting on Washington. Given our size and the benefits of the Crapo bill, those that are smaller, it\u2019s less of an urgent issue. There is obviously some potential progress and relief in the proposal. So, I would say, it feels pretty normal right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Mark Fitzgibbon","I guess, first question I had David, given the continued flattening of the yield curve, do you still feel comfortable with the NIM guidance that you had given in the fourth quarter of I think 3.05 to 3.15 for the year?","David Rosato","Yes, Mark, we do. That guidance was predicated on two fed tightenings as we said. And it looks like there will be three. So, I would call that a tailwind. We were -- the margin came in basically where we expected in the first quarter. We had guided to 5 basis points impact of tax reform; it actually turned out to be 6, a lot of that driven just by a smaller balance sheet. So, that guidance is still exactly where we think it should be.","Mark Fitzgibbon","Okay. And then, I wondered if you could update us on where you are in terms of preparing for SIFI? And also, if the threshold is lifted, how much do you think you could potentially reduce operating expense?","David Rosato","Potentially reduce expense?","Mark Fitzgibbon","Yes.","Jack Barnes","So, we\u2019ve talked for a couple of years now about our B50B project. That project has remained in place. As we\u2019ve described, there are many things that we continue to work on around things like data governance that incrementally we have built into the expense run rate. We are making very good progress there. And those are the kinds of things, Mark, where we would continue to work on, given that regardless of SIFI designation kind of where a $44 billion bank were going to be a $54 billion bank, we need to have very solid governance and control around our data. So, there\u2019s a lot of different components. I have mentioned in the past we kind of understand the living will. We are not spending any time or money or building one, we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not appropriate and it will be a waste of resource. So, we avoid those kinds of things.","So, I would think -- I think, the way for everyone to think about it is, there are many things that we have built to be prepared to cross 50 that are beneficial to the Company, and our internal run rate. And there many things that we could avoid like a living will or the impact of the liquidity ratio et cetera. And some of those things will be net benefits as we avoid them. But we wouldn\u2019t an expense reduction in sense of avoiding them. We just wouldn\u2019t have to incur it in the future.","Mark Fitzgibbon","Okay. And then lastly, I think in the press release you referenced that the commercial loan pipeline had really strengthened. I wondered if you could share with us the size of that.","Jack Barnes","Sure. Take a peek at it. Maybe first I would ask Jeff Tengel to give you a sense of where the pipelines are in his conversations from the different business lines.","Jeff Tengel","Thanks, Jack. Yes. So, our pipelines have really been growing over the course of the quarter. And I think we\u2019ve experienced some momentum as we moved through the first quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had particularly strong pipelines in some of our larger markets. So, I\u2019d point to Massachusetts as one example and Boston in particular in both our C&I and commercial real estate businesses. And we are also seeing particularly strong pipelines and good activity in Long Island which is where our bankers from Suffolk County National Bank have really started to show some momentum. If you recall about a year ago -- or it\u2019s been about a year since we acquired Suffolk County National, and so we\u2019re through a lot of the transition. So, we\u2019re back to doing kind of the good business that we\u2019ve always done in other parts of the Company.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Austin Nicholas from Stephens. Your line is open.","Austin Nicholas","Hey, guys. Good morning. Maybe just on the equipment financing growth this quarter. I think, typically, the first quarter is a little weak for that business, it looks strong. And as I look at some of the indices that track that lending area, they also look good. Can you just maybe give your outlook for that business and any benefits you are seeing from a tax reform perspective?","David Rosato","Yes. So, I\u2019ll start with the second part. We\u2019re really not seeing any benefits yet from the tax reform; we\u2019re expecting to see the favorable impact of the reform on depreciation and motivate people to move forward. I think, the people are in those planning processes now. That\u2019s just might take, but I\u2019d say we\u2019re not seeing the signs of it yet. And our expectations in the business generally on the larger and more kind of historically PCLC and Fin Fed, [ph] I would say we have reasonable growth expectations this year that are in line with our overall guidance on the loan portfolio. LEAF obviously is net new and incremental, and we expect very healthy double-digit growth from LEAF through the year.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Collyn Gilbert from KBW. Your line is open.","Collyn Gilbert","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. I apologize if you covered this already, but just wanted to talk a little bit, and I know Jeff you just gave some color as to the pipelines and where you\u2019re seeing activity in some of your markets. But, just a little bit more broadly sort of where you\u2019re thinking, how you\u2019re seeing the growth and also the pricing on it and where you\u2019re seeing some competitive pressures on pricing and where you think you have an advantage sort of as it relates to pricing as we look forward?","Jeff Tengel","Sure. So, I would say the kind of heightened competitive environment is coming in multiple direction, but -- and we do see this typically in the first half of every year. For instance in the commercial real estate area that the insurance companies come back into the market, seems to be a little more activity with funds that are competing for deals. And then, I think the reality is as we\u2019ve seen in the industry, loan growth has been soft. And so, you\u2019ve got an environment where I\u2019d like to say too much money chasing too few deals. So, competitively opportunities are in situations that are very competitive across the spectrum. And we are sticking to our underwriting discipline and we\u2019re sticking to our -- I should say, we actually had a slightly improved spread this quarter. And that was encouraging, given the business that we did and the improvements. But, I think, our biggest opportunity in terms of competing well, holding the line on pricing is all of our long standing customer relationships. So, when you have a good relationship banking business model and you\u2019ve got customers that have been with the bank from 10, 15 to 20 years, we obviously have an advantage competitively. They know us. They depend on our good solid execution. And that helps them kind of plan and operate, and we can get appropriately rewarded for that.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on the funding side, on the deposit side, where are you guys seeing deposit pricing pressure, has it intensified, and kind of what\u2019s your outlook for that going forward? And how are you sort of managing the deposits out of your business to kind of maneuver in that environment?","David Rosato","So, we have naturally a process and regular discussions about our pricing and where we are positioned in different markets. We manage it geographically; I think is the way to think about our markets in the various states. And then -- and they respond to what\u2019s going on within those markets. We are seeing, I would say, pressure across the board. People are moving certainly CD rates up. There is a lot of specials out there in different markets with different institutions and then there\u2019s people moving money market rates up. On the very large balances across government, banking, commercial and retail, it\u2019s really kind of an exception pricing environment. So, discussions based on large dollars and what people\u2019s appetite is or -- it\u2019s definitely what you would expect and I think what we are seeing as the deposit betas change.","The only color I would add to that, Collyn, is the competition is heating up but I would still characterize it as fairly well controlled today.","Collyn Gilbert","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just quickly back to loan growth, I think, in your prepared remarks or in the release, David, you had indicated that you guys still feel good about achieving your loan growth target for the year which I think you set it out to be 4% to 6%. Do you feel that the ramp as the year goes on will come from increased origination activity or just a slowing of paydowns?","David Rosato","I think, it\u2019s a combination of both, Collyn. We have had higher paydowns, actually I\u2019ll say roughly through the last four to six quarters. So it\u2019s been inching up. And I think a lot of that are either people deciding to sell properties in environment where they feel like they\u2019re just getting a very good offer that they should take or as I mentioned, insurance companies come into a deal and get very aggressive about competing.","On the origination side, we feel very good about the businesses. One of the first places that I go in my mind in terms of our opportunities is the diverse nature of our portfolio. And so, you\u2019ve got a lot of different very specialized, focused lending platforms. And they all have strength and they all have good people and they have an ability to grow. Obviously, real estate has been -- it\u2019s been a challenging period. And, we continue to move through that. Again, we\u2019ve got a lot of very good people in that business and a lot of very good customers. So, we expect to keep moving forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matthew Breese from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. ","Matthew Breese","Just a few quick follow-ups. On the pipeline, could you just give us a sense for what the pipeline yield is and how that compares to what\u2019s on the books?","Jack Barnes","Pipeline, what?","David Rosato","The pipeline yield. It\u2019s consistent with what went on the books this quarter. So, the way we think about that is we look at existing portfolio versus new business that goes on each quarter. And we\u2019ve talked about that an awful lot. That average in the mid 20s, mid to upper 20s the couple of quarters, and that has moved up about another 20 basis points. So, that differential is around 50 basis points these days. So, think about a pipeline yielding about 50 basis points more than the existing aggregate loan book.","Matthew Breese","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, on LEAF, you noted the balances were up 8% on average quarter-to-quarter. Could you just give us an update on what those balances actually were -- what the yield is on that portfolio? And you know as you look back at acquisition, is it behaving the way you thought in terms of credit quality and growth and all that?","David Rosato","Sure. So, the ending balance at 3\/31 was $865 million. Everything about that acquisition is tracking where we expected it to be, so, very favorable from a growth perspective, from a yield perspective. Their yields range in the mid 7.5%.","Matthew Breese","Got it, okay. And then, my last one is really around the competitive dynamics of the markets. You touched on it a little bit. But, just wanted to get a sense for, do you think some of the benefits of tax reform are being competed away through higher deposit betas and lower loan betas?","Jack Barnes","Yes. We are concerned about that. I would say some -- in some deals that we lose, we certainly would draw conclusion that some people may be -- we are trying hard not to do that and hold the line. But, I would say, there is some pressure. We\u2019ll see how people play it out. We\u2019re not going to have a real good feel for that until we get into half or through the year, really understand how aggressive people will get.","David Rosato","The only thing I would add to that Matt is for all the pressure we see and feel as a bank and as an industry, the fact is that our credit spreads actually widened a few basis points in the quarter. That\u2019s the one hard fact that we have.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone line. I would now turn the conference call back over to Mr. Barnes for any closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, our strong first quarter performance was highlighted by another quarter of record earnings, continued revenue growth, and effective expense management, significant year-over-year improvements in both return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity, sustained exceptional asset quality, and further reduction in the common dividend payout ratio through earnings growth.","Finally, given the importance of the common dividend to our shareholders, we were also proud to announce the Company\u2019s 25th consecutive annual common dividend increase.","Thank you for your interest in People\u2019s United. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Liz and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded of replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our third quarter 2019 results are Jack Barnes, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, President; and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer.","Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. We appreciate everyone joining us today. Let's begin by turning to the third quarter overview on Slide 2. Our third quarter performance, which reflects another quarter of record earnings, further demonstrates our success and strengthening the earnings power of the Company, while continuing to build the franchise for the long-term.","As such, we are pleased to report operating earnings of $135.5 million, an increase of 19% from a year ago and an operating return on average tangible common equity of 14.4%. On a per common share basis, operating earnings were $0.34. Third quarter results were highlighted by net interest margins of 3.12% [Technical Difficulty] higher than the total portfolio yield. The margin through nine months is 3.14%, well within our full year outlook range of 3.05% to 3.15%.","Total revenues of $454.7 million increased both linked quarter and year-over-year, and continued to benefit from strong non-interest income. Modestly higher expenses compared to the second quarter drove a 100 basis point increase in the efficiency ratio to 56.8%. Our ability to enhance operating leverage is evidenced by a year-to-date efficiency ratio of 56.6%, an improvement of 160 basis points compared to the prior year period.","Our thoughtful approach to expense management has enabled us to control costs, while continuing to make important investments in our digital capabilities. We have launched several mobile device and online driven offerings this year. Some of which, we have discussed previously, including a residential mortgage and home equity lending portal and enhanced deposit account opening solution, a direct to client investment platform and a more advanced peoples.com website.","Our latest offering is a digital small business solution for loans of $250,000 or less, which will rollout this quarter. Looking forward, we will continue to partner with fintech companies to bring greater efficiency, ease of use, and scale to our suite of digital products and services to meet the evolving needs of our customers.","Moving on to loans, period-end balances increased $224 million or 1% from the end of the second quarter, driven by solid commercial loan growth, partially offset by a planned reduction in residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. The growth in the commercial portfolio was primarily due to mortgage warehouse lending, equipment finance and Boston commercial real estate.","Period-end deposits declined $893 million or 2%, partially due to a second quarter ending balance, including $500 million short-term commercial deposit, which was withdrawn in July as expected. On an average basis, deposits were down 1%, primarily driven by lower savings and time balances, partially offset by increased non-interest bearing deposits.","Despite the decline in balances, we continue to be pleased with our ability to gather deposits. Recent FDIC data confirm we maintain strong market share in each state in which we operate, and continue to hold the number one position in Fairfield County, Connecticut, and the State of Vermont. We are particularly pleased, our market share in Massachusetts is now in the top 10, driven by the addition of Belmont along with organic growth, we moved up four spots to number nine.","The acquisition of United Financial is on track to close in the fourth quarter, and we remain confident in achieving the transactions attractive financial returns. The integration process is underway progressing well as we execute on our time-tested acquisition approach.","The addition of United bolsters our already significant share of retail households and commercial clients across Central Connecticut and Western Massachusetts. We are excited for their long-tenured well established customer base to join People's United, and benefit from our broader array of products, services and technology offerings.","Before I pass the call over to David to discuss the quarter's results in more detail, I wanted to share some thoughts on the operating environment. Looking ahead, our view is customers continue to manage their businesses thoughtfully and are looking to take advantage of opportunities to grow.","We continue to see areas of meaningful growth, particularly in Boston and Metro New York, as well as in our equipment, finance and specialty businesses. However, uncertainty about the economy, whether trade related or recessionary fears, is concerning the marketplace. Additionally, a heightened competition remains, notably in commercial real estate. And our expectation is this will not abate in the coming year.","Despite these economic and competitive uncertainties, we are cautiously optimistic about loan growth. We have broadened the capabilities of the franchise through strategic investments in talent and enhanced digital offerings, while also adding retail households and commercial clients through thoughtful acquisitions.","While we have grown in size, we remain true to our roots, as a bank with significant local knowledge and the ability to provide tailored solutions to meet the individual needs of our customers. This solutions-oriented approach to banking differentiates People's United and positions us well to take advantage of growth opportunities in any environment.","It is also evident margin compression will be a headwind in 2020 by the extent -- but the extent to which will largely be dependent on potential changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy. However, we remain focused on managing what we can control to offset the effects of declining interest rates.","These levers include continuing to remix the asset side of the balance sheet by reducing lower yielding residential mortgages, growing our higher yielding commercial loan portfolios, managing deposit cost proactively, continuing to build our fee income businesses, capturing revenue and expense synergies of recent acquisitions and sustaining excellent asset quality.","Our long term approach to managing the business has and will further enable us to generate value for shareholders and customers, regardless of the uncertainties in the operating environment.","With that, here's David.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. Third quarter financial results were highlighted by a stable net interest margin, continued strong non-interest income, well maintained expenses and a lower effective tax rate.","Turning to Slide 3. Net interest income of $348.7 million was up $600,000 from the second quarter. Net interest income benefitted $5.4 million due to improved deposit pricing and lower balances, as well as $2 million from an additional calendar day in the third quarter. Conversely, the loan portfolio reduced net interest income by $3.7 million due to the downward re-pricing of floating rate loans. In addition, increased borrowings and lower yields in the securities portfolio negatively impacted net interest income by $1.7 million and $1.4 million, respectively.","As displayed on Slide 4, net interest margin of 3.12 was unchanged from the second quarter despite declining interest rates. As Jack referenced in his comments, the margin benefited from our proactive management of deposit costs, and new business yields remaining higher than the total loan portfolio of the yield.","Improved deposit pricing favorably impacted net interest margin by 5 basis points, while the additional calendar day added 2 basis points. The largest offset to these increases were lower yields in the existing loan portfolio, which reduced net interest margin by 4 basis points. Increase borrowings and lower security yields unfavorably impacted the margin by 2 basis points and 1 basis point respectively.","Turning to loans on Slide 5. Average balances of $38.3 billion increased by $88 million or less than 1% from the second quarter. On a period end basis, loans ended the quarter at $38.8 billion, up $224 million, or 1% from June 30th. Commercial period end loans grew $505 million or 2%, primarily driven by mortgage warehouse lending, equipment finance and Boston commercial real estate, partially offset by $89 million of runoff in the New York multifamily portfolio.","Conversely, retail period end loans declined $281 million or 2%, mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios. Mortgage warehouse lending benefited from the decline in the interest rates, which increased refinance and mortgage purchase activity.","Balances ended the quarter at nearly $1.7 billion, up $429 million from the end of the second quarter. Equipment finance grew $125 million, primarily reflecting further strong production by LEAF. Furthermore, our commercial real estate business in Boston continued to benefit from the momentum generated by the addition of the Belmont's team.","Moving on to deposits. Period end balances declined $893 million or 2%, partially due to second quarter ending deposits, including $500 million short-term commercial deposit, which was withdrawn in July as expected. On an average basis, as displayed on Slide 6, deposits decreased $554 million or 1% linked quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in savings of $304 million and time balances of $142 million, partially offset by an increase in non-interest bearing deposits of $171 million.","Interest bearing checking and money market balances declined $279 million. Of which approximately $250 million is related to the withdrawal of the large short-term commercial deposit. It is important to note that non-interest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits improved to approximately 24% from 22% at the end of the second quarter.","We remain focused on controlling pricing, as evidenced by a 4 basis point reduction in deposit costs during the quarter, which marked the first quarterly decline since the third quarter of 2016. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we proactively lowered CD deposit costs 2 times in the two month, leading up to the Fed's July 31st rate cut, and then we subsequently lowered money market rates twice in the quarter.","Non-interest income of $106 million marked another strong quarter. Other down $300,000 linked quarter. The results are up $13.7 million or 15% year-over-year. Year-to-date, non-interest income of $307 million is up nearly 11% compared to the prior year period.","On Slide 7, the components of the linked quarter variance are displayed; non-interest income in the quarter benefited from $1.6 million in higher commercial banking lending fees, driven by increased commercial real estate prepayment income; $1.6 million in higher insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals; a $600,000 increase in bank service charges, primarily resulting from an additional calendar day in the third quarter; and higher operating lease income and investment management fees, which collectively improved non-interest income by $500,000.","The largest driver offsetting these increases was lower customer interest rate swap income, which was down $2 million from a record second quarter. Non-interest income was also unfavorably impacted by $2.6 million decrease in other fee income, which is primarily driven by the mark-to-market of one equity security position and normalized BOLI income.","On Slide 8, non-interest expense of $281.4 million increased $3 million linked quarter. Included in the third quarter were $5 million of merger related costs in the following categories; $3.7 million in professional and outside services; $800,000 in compensation and benefits; and the remaining $500,000 in occupancy and equipment and other.","In comparison, the second quarter incurred $6.5 million of merger related costs. Excluding merger related costs, non-interest expense of $276.4 million was up $4.5 million or 2% linked quarter. The largest component of the increase was $8 million in higher other expenses, driven by several items, most notably certain legal and other one-time operational costs. The primary offsets to these increases was a $2.5 million reduction in compensation and benefits, resulting primarily from lower payroll costs and a $1.2 million improvement in regulatory assessments attributable to an FDIC credit.","Turning the Slide 9. The efficiency ratio of 56.8% increased 100 basis points from the second quarter due to a modest increase in expenses. Year-over-year, the efficiency ratio was up only 10 basis points. Despite the increase in the third quarter, we are very pleased with the significant progress we have made enhancing operating leverage, as evidenced by the year-to-date efficiency ratio of 56.6%, which improved 160 basis points from the prior year period.","Asset quality was once again exceptional across each of our portfolios, as demonstrated on Slide 10. Originated non-performing assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO at 56 basis points, was unchanged from the second quarter and remained below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge offs of 6 basis points increased slightly from an already low level, and continued to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.","Briefly on Slides 11 and 12, return on average assets improved the basis point linked quarter to 105 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity decreased 10 basis points to 14%. On an operating basis, return on average assets was also 105 basis points, while return on average tangible common equity was 14.4%. As you can see on Slide 12, capital ratios remain strong, given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","Before opening up the call for questions, I wanted to make a few comments on CECL. Our implementation efforts are progressing according to plan as we prepare for adoption on January 1, 2020. Based on current forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances at the end of the third quarter, the impact of CECL upon implementation could result in an increase of as much as 15% to 25%, or approximately $40 million to $60 million to existing reserves.","This increase is driven primarily by higher reserve requirements associated with the Company's longer duration retail portfolio, partially offset by shorter duration commercial portfolios and our low historical of loss experience. As a result, the current estimated impact on capital ratios, for both the bank and the holding company, is a decrease of approximately 10 to 15 basis points. It is important to note these estimates, which are subjects of further refinements and any potential change in economic outlook before year end, do not include the impact of the United acquisition.","Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to open the lines up for your questions. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","So you clearly did a nice job of lowering deposit rates in the third quarter. How much further do you think you could produce deposit rates here in 4Q? And tied to that, what's the outlook for the NIM here near term?","David Rosato","I'll start with the latter part of that question, Steve. Our experience has been that a 25 basis point move in either the Fed funds rate or one month LIBOR equates to 3 basis points to 4 basis points of NIM compression. We appreciate your comment on being proactive on deposit cost management. If there's another move in the end of this month, we would expect to be able to move deposit costs in both CDs, as well as money markets down commensurate with what we did in the in the prior two moves. That's not a full 25 basis points, but that's in the range of about 15 basis points give or take.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then on the loan side, given the remixing you're doing. When does this headwind move behind you? And when should we start to see stronger reported loan growth?","David Rosato","That's going to take a while, Steve. So first of all, we do have the headwind of New York multifamily, which we guided last quarter to $200 million to $300 million for the year, it's been a $175 million year-to-date. Every 1% decrease in that residential mortgage portfolio is just about $400 million. So the full remixing of our existing portfolio today or at the end of the third quarter is probably a few year of that. However, that doesn't mean there's not going to be loan growth over that time period.","Jack Barnes","For me, obviously, building the commercial portfolios is going to be very market opportunity dependent. Some of them are growing nicely at a good steady pace, but others are facing that could be headwinds we talked about, especially real estate the biggest one.","Steven Alexopoulos","And then just a big picture question on M&A. So you guys have done several nice M&A deals, have been in market, cost saves are strong, earned back is short. With that said, the market's not responding M&A the way it used to right, even for your deals. Do you guys start to think differently about M&A as a tool to create shareholder value given the dynamics around it?","David Rosato","I would say no. The decline in interest rates is something we're paying a lot of attention to in terms of our thoughts around M&A, pricing, et cetera. But if you just look at the M&A we have done with the metrics that you described and then think about building deposit households in those markets where we have presence and gaining market share and gaining opportunity to deepen those relationships, we think that's all been very valuable and will continue to pay dividends for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","So I guess maybe starting off in terms of fee income. I noticed you guys didn't include your outlook slide for the year in your slide deck. But is there any comments on why you pulled out, that will be helpful. But the question in terms of fee income, I think your guidance was up couple of percentage points. But it seems that the 106 level that you're hosting is kind of meaningfully above the 2% to 4% growth that you had previously outlined in your slide deck. Is 106 the right level for fees or -- and still unusual items in there? Thanks.","David Rosato","So I'd go back to our -- we had a little discussion on the call last quarter where we said though we had a strong second quarter at 106.3, we decided not to raise guidance, just because of the variability of some of those drivers. But we did say that we would likely be at the high end of guidance or maybe even over. Now with another quarter at 106, I would say, yes, we will definitely be over the original guidance. I wouldn't go so far as to say 106 is a sustainable rate, just because of the volatility of some of the capital markets activities.","But away from that, we continue to be highly focused, as Jack said in his comments, on growing our insurance business, our capital management business, our wealth management business, which are much more steady performers. And then we'll have some good capital markets quarters as well.","Ken Zerbe","And then just a second question. In terms of CECL, we really appreciate the additional clarity you provided in terms of the impact of CECL, but I'm not sure how to phrase this exactly. But what's the ultimate impact? I mean, I get it's 10 to 15 basis points of capital. Presumably, there's the 3-year phase in on from a regulatory standpoint. I mean, does it matter that you are going to increase reserves $14 million to $16 million? Is there any negative impact from weather its rating agencies, or anything else that I can possibly think of that we should as to sort of the sell and buy side maybe be paying attention to?","David Rosato","It's a good question. It's a question we talk about internally here as well. So CECL is an accounting exercise. It's not a reflect -- that $40 million to $60 million in our opinion is not a reflection of additional risk within that portfolio. It's a different way that we are now required to model and provision in a new accounting regime. And I would say it makes it harder for all of us, you guys, it's investor, as well as us.","Ken Zerbe","But it doesn't change any way of whether you're thinking of buybacks or loan growth, or anything, there's no impact to that, other than on the balance sheet, of course?","David Rosato","Right, we will not operate our bank any differently or think about credit any differently that is used today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo.","Jared Shaw","I guess not to beat a dead horse, but sticking with CECL for a minute here. When you look at the UBNK deal, was that structure with CECL 9? Or is there going to be an incremental mark in excess of that, the 1.8% mark you've hit on there because of sort of a double accounting? Will that impact UBNK and will that impact the sort of economics of the deal?","David Rosato","So we will partially answer that question. We have -- obviously, when we worked on that deal, we were very thoughtful of the impact that we would eventually have to account for that transaction under CECL methodology. But with that said and an expectation that we will close it this year, we're really not going to comment. And the estimates we just gave were exclusive of United, inclusive of Belmont, because they were on the books at the end of the quarter. But we're not going to make any comments on CECL so relativity to United.","Jared Shaw","I guess, the CECL now being out there change the way you're viewing M&A as a strategy in and of itself? Does that make it harder to make a deal work in your minds or, again, sort of like with putting loans on the books so it doesn't fundamentally change the way you look at\u2026","David Rosato","I would say the answer is no. And I would go back and reference with what Jack said about the thoughtful M&A we're doing is a long-term perspective about gaining market share, getting and growing new customer basis. And so an accounting -- new accounting regime will change some reported deal metrics in the short term, but it's not going to change that strategy. And really CECL is very bank transactions deal specific.","Jack Barnes","Jared, I would say one common view I've heard in the industry discussions is that CECL and the requirements for longer duration -- greater reserves for longer duration portfolios is likely over time to discourage banks from holding residential real estate loans on their books, for instance. And that would seem to be logical and it makes you then wonder, whether the economics change and maybe rate expectations, spread expectations change on certain types of lending because of that, which seems very counter to the idea that a change in accounting approach would drive one of the less -- least risky businesses to hire reserves. But that's what it's doing.","Jared Shaw","And then just finally for me, you'd mentioned there could be broader market concern I guess around the economy. How does that -- how do you view growing the equipment finance and some of the other, I guess, specifically equipment finance lending? In light of that you, do feel that you want to slow that down if we think they were coming to the belly of the cycle, or the beginning of the end of the cycle? Or is that you're still expecting to see good growth in that over the next year?","David Rosato","Well, right now, we are expecting economic activity to remain somewhere at the levels and in the zone it's in, if you will. So there's nothing in data that's telling us that GDP is going to slow, or that unemployment is going to increase and the consumer is going to slow spending. There's a piece of information like the manufacturing data for instance once in a while. But generally, we feel that we're not on the verge of a recession. And we're certainly not changing our approach to any of the businesses, including equipment finance. We have studied and know that the equipment finance portfolio we expect will do well when challenges are recessionary environment, but the growth will slow as small businesses slow their borrowing in those environments?","Operator","Your next question comes from Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","I wanted to follow up on the NIM. I think we're all kind of impressed by the loan yields holding up. I was wondering was there a pickup in purchase accounting on a quarter?","David Rosato","Very modest, about $2.5 million linked quarter and on around maybe a basis point to the NIM.","Jack Barnes","But it was not a driver.","Casey Haire","And then -- so the resi mortgage reduction, is there -- is that -- did you get the low hanging fruit, or is there more opportunities to do that and any other balance sheet restructurings to help to fund the NIM going forward?","David Rosato","What really happened in the residential mortgage portfolio has been our strategy for the last three quarters, which is really to be less aggressive on origination rates, so working for wider spreads. The reduction was larger in the third quarter just because the level of interest rates drop and refi activity picked up so much. So we had essentially greater number of loans paid off and we just slowed the flow of replacement, but that working for wider spreads is definitely the objective. That's how we will manage the pace of the remixing.","Casey Haire","And just follow-up on the deposit side, you guys obviously did a good job in being proactive. The loan to deposit ratio did tick up over 100. I know you had that big deposit kind of walk out the door. But what -- can you just give us some thoughts and your ability to be -- to continue to be proactive with the loan to deposit ratio above 100?","David Rosato","Yes. If you put the clock back three, four years ago, we were -- we had quite a few -- we were quite a long period of time, we were over 100%. And we talked about how hard we were working to grow deposits. In this quarter, I would -- besides the 500 million commercial customer that outflow, the loan to deposit ratio was impacted by the growth in our mortgage warehouse, which hit a record level of almost 1.7 billion, and that will subside and take that pressure off over time. Obviously, we manage on a week to week basis, the commercial, retail and government banking deposits relative to the cost and the volumes. So we always strive to keep that number below 100%, almost every quarter we do. It's lifted up 1% this quarter.","Casey Haire","And just last one for me, just you mentioned the loan yields coming in above existing. The mortgage warehouse, obviously, a big contributor to the loan growth this year -- this quarter. What are the yields there? And then equipment finance, the new money yields there. And is that the VaR stuff that's being accretive to the yield?","David Rosato","Sure, a couple of things. So first, I would say and we said this on the last quarter the differential between new business yields, last quarter in the portfolio was about 50 basis points. That did contract this quarter. This quarter is about 30 basis points. The still positive and nicely positive, but not quite as positive, had to deal with the drop in one month LIBOR, which was about 25, 26 basis points linked quarter. The mortgage warehouse spread came in a bit in the quarter, but are a little more of 200 -- 2%, 200 basis points.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Bishop from D.A. Davidson.","Dave Bishop","Heading back to deposits on one of your competitors, their conference call this morning, I know quoted about an 8 point differential between peak deposit cost and current rates you're out there paying. So curious if you have a similar number where you've seen the overall cost of deposits, I guess, peak to currently?","David Rosato","I'm not sure we heard everything you said. But you were asking about our current existing deposit costs relative to the new business that's going on?","Dave Bishop","Yes, new business and maybe how it compares to where you are at the, I guess, the peak maybe the summer, how far you sort of come off the peak of average deposit costs?","David Rosato","Well, as you saw, average deposit costs came down 4 basis points in the quarter. The way we really think about it is where we're trying to specifically raise deposits, either in retail CDs, or in money markets and kind of what those specials are, so to speak. What I said in my comments is prior to the end of the second quarter, we lowered CD -- promotional CD rates twice. And then in the third quarter, we lowered money markets twice. For example, today we have a -- we're raising six month CDs as about a 180 across our franchise. We would be accessing that to come down.","As right now we have a little over 80% chance is what the market is pricing in for that move at the end of the month. So we will be bringing our CD special rates down and then also our money market promos down as we get a little closer to that, Dave. But if I think about those rates today relative to deposit costs, that relationship is not fundamentally different than where it was three months ago.","Dave Bishop","I think in the preamble you noted that, or within the other operating expense category, there was a number of, I guess, quasi unusual one-time type items. Just curious in totality how much flow through the other expense category this quarter?","David Rosato","Yes, it was $8 million.","Dave Bishop","And that's used more as unusual one-times. I think you mentioned some legal type expenses for either\u2026","David Rosato","Yes, definitely one-time not in the run rate.","Dave Bishop","And in terms of the effective tax rate, look like that was a little bit lower than the first couple of quarters here. Anything unusual there maybe some guides and sort of for the 2020?","David Rosato","No, that was just - in the quarter, we filed our 2018 taxes. And we have a fairly large low income housing tax portfolio and favorable impact on the tax rate. So a little bit of catch up once all this K-1s came in from those investments. You haven't followed us for too many years, but it's a normal third or fourth quarter event for us.","Dave Bishop","And then just one final question, just looking through the slide deck. Clearly, capital levels remain well below the -- well above the well capitalized rate, but total risk based capital. Is that sort of the governor here in terms of the growth across all their -- just curious in terms of where you see the -- I guess, the narrowest margin above the well capitalized range and how you think about that?","David Rosato","Yes, we're a company that -- usually, the capital constraint for us is total risk-based capital just because of the large commercial lending book that we have. Always easily address when that time is right with sub-debt issuance, but at 12% it's on the low end historically. But we're very comfortable with it sitting there today with the risk in our business mix.","Operator","Your next question comes from Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","Most of my questions have been asked. And I think, Casey, hit on a handful of them. But just back to the loan yield. And again, I think just trying to reconcile your comments David about 25 basis point cut in rates would imply a 2 to 3 basis point compression in NIM. You didn't see it this quarter, obviously, it fared better. So just dissecting that a little bit more, the mix here is relevant.","And then also on what you did on the deposit side, because I think you'd guided to or you'd indicated last quarter that you were thinking maybe deposit costs would still tick up this quarter but then drop in the fourth quarter. So just trying to piece this all together, so just on the loan yield side. So you mentioned what the warehouse loan yields were 200 basis points over. Just curious what the yields were, newly casing yields were on the equipment finance and then just more of your traditional C&I loans?","David Rosato","A couple of things there, Collyn. Hopefully, I get them all. You know not 2 to 3 basis points, I thought I said 3 to 4. I would also -- I probably should have mentioned. I would say, because of the lateness of the second move by the Fed, there's probably a little bit of re-pricing left from that move in our home equity portfolio that's the cycle for a full month to have all those prime days loans re-priced. I don't have a number for you on that it's just a small number, but it's out there.","On the -- and actually, I don't remember us saying that we thought deposit costs would tick up in the third quarter. I'm pretty sure we said the opposite, or we were silent to that. And then lastly just across the -- we really have -- we have three different equipment platforms that are all -- that are quite different in nature, as you know with the lowest yielding, doing the larger transactions, our original PCLC. Coupons in that business run from about 4.25.","Our highest yielding is the old financial federal People's United equipment finance where we can run yield from 6.5% to 7% on average for that business. And then as we talked about many times before can run 7%, 7.5% type range on that portfolio.","Collyn Gilbert","So you're not seeing -- or you're not seeing much compression then on new origination yields within that segment? It just doesn't seem that there's a lot of variation I don't think from what you have indicated in the past?","David Rosato","I would say there's pricing pressures and it's mostly in the largest one PCLC. But I would say across those three businesses, the managers fight that every day and do an exceptionally good job. There's across we talked many times about how diversified all of our lending businesses are. We are seeing pressure in our large corporate. We talked about mortgage warehouse PCLC. Commercial real estate is relatively steady, at least has been steady. And some of we've actually in the quarter had some businesses where we're able to widen spreads.","Collyn Gilbert","And then just shifting to loan growth, so I'm pretty sure all them, I mean, here I know it's wrong again. But on the loan growth guide, I thought you guys were thinking before UBNK were at 10% to 12% for the year. Is that correct that what your prior guidance was?","David Rosato","Yes, correct.","Collyn Gilbert","So you're there more or less year-to-date. So just trying to think about, and Jack, I appreciate your comments kind of broadly and how you're seeing your consumer behavior and such. But just curious -- and mortgage warehouse obviously was elevated this quarter, maybe some flows during the fourth quarter. But just sort of how you sort of see some of the pipelines trending as you go into the fourth quarter as it relates to loan growth?","Jeff Tengel","Collyn, this is Jeff Tengel. We see the fourth quarter, the pipelines are still, I would characterize them as being in good shape, pretty consistent with where we saw them coming into the third quarter. There's obviously some variables there, the mortgage warehouse lending business being a big one. Some of that's offset by the fourth quarter historically being a pretty strong quarter for our equipment finance business.","So we still feel pretty good about the health of the pipeline going into the fourth quarter. We saw an elevated level of payoffs in the third quarter in a number of our businesses, which if that does not occur in the fourth quarter, would be a benefit. A lot of M&A activity, a lot of capital markets activity that impacted some of our businesses that's we're hopeful won\u2019t occur in the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brock Vandervliet with UBS.","Brock Vandervliet","Just going back to couple of these comments, you touched on CECL and the loan-to-deposit ratio. It would seem like in the growth headwind that you've referenced. Could you accelerate some of that process by potentially selling down some of the resi exposure, and it's dilutive to asset yields somewhat pejorative under CECL, as you mentioned. You create some more shelf space with your LD ratio. And why not do that?","David Rosato","We could. Last quarter, we were asked about could we do that in New York multifamily and we said, yes, we could. And both are profitable portfolios. So we think and talk about it. Our outlook discusses these strategies like that from time to time. But we usually get back to -- we're comfortable with the credit risk. We have the capital to support it. They're making money for us and it gives us more time to remix the balance sheet. We don't feel we need to accelerate the remix of the balance sheet, because we don't -- of all those things I mentioned not up but more overly concern ourselves.","Brock Vandervliet","And separately on the funding side, is there anything you'd call out in terms of the cadence of CD or FHLB repricing in the fourth quarter that would, or first quarter next year, that would allow you to step down those rates more quickly?","David Rosato","I guess, I'd say two things. One is the wholesale borrowings that we do in the markets are from the home loan stepped down -- those costs stepped down nicely, because there are much more market sensitive. So they will pretty much move with one-month LIBOR. On the customer funding side, we're obviously subject to what our competitors are doing across their portfolios, retail, commercial, et cetera.","The good news in that is the industry has been quite disciplined. We talked about on this call we were a little early in some of those moves. But we've seen more -- we've seen other banks be aggressive as well, which is a great thing.","Jeff Tengel","And there's a lot of turn in the CD book. So if you think about into the future quarters, if rates drop and the market lowers rates, we'll be able to benefit from that as CDs mature and reprice.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, we're pleased with the strong third quarter performance, which was highlighted by another quarter of record earnings, stable net interest margin, lower deposit costs, continued strong fee income, well maintained expenses and sustained excellent asset quality. Thank you for your interest in People's United. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Erica, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our first quarter results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. Before we get into the particulars of the quarter, I'd like to share some thoughts about how we are continuing to build franchise value. We are consistent with our conservative approach building this franchise for the long term. The way we address investment choices on business units, talent, compliance, stress testing, new product development and more, will position us very well in the years ahead. Of course, it is an art, especially given the low interest rate environment to keep improving shareholder returns while making investments in some areas and streamlining others.","Ultimately, we are shareholders and our choices are designed to maximize shareholder returns not only in the near term but over the medium and long term. We feel good about our progress moving the company forward.","Now with respect to the first quarter results, on Slide 2, operating earnings were $57.9 million or $0.18 per share, with net income of $52.5 million or $0.16 per share. The net interest margin declined by 25 basis points to 3.38% compared to 3.63% in the fourth quarter. The decline was expected and was due to a number of factors that Kirk will cover in a few minutes. We believe that our net interest margin has now largely stabilized in line with our guidance in January, which should allow net interest income to grow at a pace similar to our growth in earning assets.","We are very pleased the end of period loans grew at an 8% annualized rate in the first quarter. If we were to look at the quarterly averages, annualized loan growth was even stronger at 10%. Either way, our loan growth this quarter is a continuation of our momentum which began in the third quarter of last year, and occurred despite the fact that the first quarter is historically a seasonally slower quarter for loan growth. Further, our pipeline remains strong and runoff in the acquired portfolio has slowed as we predicted in January.","The efficiency ratio for the quarter rose to 64.1% from 63.1% in the fourth quarter primarily due to a lower net interest income. Expected growth in net interest income combined with fee income expansion and expense control will produce efficiency ratio progress in the quarters ahead. We remain focused on attaining a 55% efficiency ratio by the fourth quarter of 2014.","Asset quality remains strong. One of the most important lessons learned during my 30 years in banking, including my time as an FDIC examiner and a chief credit officer is that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow a balance sheet. With a period of prolonged low interest rates and above-average capital levels comes the opportunity to repurchase shares at a discount to our earnings power in a normalized rate environment. Share repurchases also have the effect of helping to normalize both our dividend payout ratio and return on average tangible equity. Accordingly, we stepped up our repurchase activity this quarter repurchasing 11.1 million shares, up from 4.7 million shares last quarter. Still, capital ratios remain strong especially in light of our relatively low risk business model at approximately 140 basis points above peers on a tangible equity to tangible asset basis.","With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 3.38% margin results for the quarter. As you recall, the fourth quarter operating net interest margin is 3.63%. As expected, higher average securities balances pressured our margin by 7 basis points. The securities portfolio represents 15% of total assets, which although up from the middle of last year remains below our peer medium.","The full quarter impact of our December senior note offering and fewer calendar days in the first quarter negatively impacted our margin by 5 basis points each, or 10 basis points in total. The effects of lower yield in new loan volume and acquired loan accretion reduced the margin by 4 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively.","On an encouraging note, we only lost 2 basis points related to loan repricing and amortization this quarter, which is largely offset by lower deposit rates and a better mix, which benefited the margin by 1 basis point.","In the quarters ahead, we will be working hard to increase the level of DDAs to help offset some of the decline in loan yields. As Jack mentioned earlier, we anticipate our net interest margin has largely stabilized having worked through significant levels of acquired loan runoff and over 4 years of repricing on the originated portfolio.","Slide 4 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $37 million and the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $2.1 billion, down from $2.2 billion last quarter and $3.4 billion 1 year ago. All of these portfolios are seasoned at this point, and since we aggressively dealt with some of the more troubled loans first, we continue to believe that our acquired loan portfolio credit marks will prove to be sufficient.","Slide 5 was designed to provide clarity around the cumbersome acquired loan accounting. There are 3 main takeaways here. First, as shown in the middle of the left-hand column, the weighted average cash coupon on the acquired loan portfolio is 5.16% this quarter. With that number, observers can make their own estimates about the speed of prepayments in this lower rate environment.","Second, the impact to the amortization, the original discount applied to the loans at the time of the acquisitions is 14 basis points this quarter. This level has remained relatively constant over the past few quarters.","Third and finally, the additional accretion associated with original discount contributed $0.02 to our first quarter 2013 earnings. This is once again a level consistent with recent quarters.","Over time, as the acquired loans repay mature or settled, the amortization original discount will dissipate, keeping in mind that acquired loan portfolio runoffs has now slowed considerably from the levels witnessed last year.","Slide 6 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $424 million or 7.8% annualized. This is a testament to our expanded footprint, as well as progress in our heritage markets and strengthened product line up.","We experienced acquired loan runoff of $155 million this quarter, down from almost $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The acquired loan portfolio runoff is expected to remain at these lower levels through the balance of the year, given our resolution of significant problem assets, continued portfolio seasoning and longer duration of the remaining assets.","Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled approximately $580 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Commercial real estate contributed 65% of total originated loan growth or $377 million, including $198 million from New York commercial real estate. The portfolio remains broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million.","C&I contributed 11% or $66 million. Within C&I we saw strength across all categories.","Residential mortgages contributed 17% or $96 million of originated loan growth in the first quarter. Approximately 88% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. In the first quarter of 2013, the average loan origination size was 667,500. The average FICO score was 758 with an average LTV of 65%. The residential mortgage pipeline is up 6% quarter-over-quarter and 65% of the pipeline is jumbo product. One positive from all the mortgage banking activity is continued strong gains in sale income. A trend which now seems likely to continue for at least the first half of 2013.","New home equity commitment closings totaled $183 million compared to $172 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. In terms of recent originations, average size of first quarter 2000 (sic) [ 2013 ] originations was $141,300. The average FICO score for the first quarter 2013 originations is 762 with an average combined loan-to-value of 58%. It's important to note that 100% of home equity loans were retail originated with 65% in the first lien position.","As you think about next quarter, our municipal business tends to be seasonally lower in the second quarter as their fiscal year end activity negatively impacts loan and deposit balances. The actual business fundamentals within this customer base is strong. It is merely a timing issue.","You can see on Slide 7 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Retail deposits increased by $172 million, while commercial deposits decreased $131 million. We continue to improve the mix of our deposit base with time deposits decreasing $120 million over the quarter. The improved deposit mix and efforts throughout our franchise to lower deposit cost, particularly in the acquired markets, contributed to a further decline in deposit cost to 39 basis points.","The larger deposit opportunities relate to acquired deposits, continuing to increase our deposit mix in favor of non-interest-bearing deposits, and a better utilization of our Southern New York branches. Acquired deposits represent 15% of total deposits and weighted average cost of 73 basis points. Over time, these rates will continue to move towards our franchise average deposit costs.","Noninterest income grew 14.5% over the prior year period with growth in almost every fee income business, as business leaders and relationship managers continue to bring our customer focus banking model to our expanded geographic footprint.","As shown on Slide 8, on a linked quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $1.4 million from a very strong fourth quarter level. Insurance revenue had a seasonally stronger quarter, while bank service charges were seasonally lighter due to typically lower levels of overdraft fees. Loan prepayment fees and gains on loan sales also decreased by $800,000, $700,000, respectively. Loan prepayment fees were fairly high during the past 2 quarters and we anticipate lighter levels in the quarters ahead. I would also note that our brokerage business improved on a linked quarter basis. This was driven by both better engagement from retail customers and through additional customers added in some of our newer markets.","On Slide 9, we illustrate the key components of our changes in non-interest expense. From an operating expense perspective, payroll-related costs increased $2.7 million, which is largely seasonal as a result of higher payroll taxes and 401(k) match expenses associated with the restart of annual limits. Net REO costs were higher by higher by $1.1 million as a result of fewer gains in REO this quarter as compared to last quarter. More than offsetting these items were lower professional and outside service costs, which was driven by better pricing and vendor credits. The net impact was a $500,000 reduction in operating expenses for the quarter. Nonoperating expense increases were driven by branch closure accruals, 4 branches in New York and 1 branch in Connecticut.","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated non-performing assets at 1.42% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and top 50 banks, and are down from 1.85% in the first quarter of 2012.","Looking at Slide 11, net charge-offs remain low at 24 basis points compared to 19 basis points last quarter and 22 basis points 1 year ago. Excluding the acquired loan charge-offs, which were primarily due to a single loan within the acquired RiverBank portfolio, net charge-offs this quarter were 18 basis points. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in non-performing assets and are well below peers.","Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 59% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically at very few new credit events each quarter.","Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per share basis, while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past 2 years loans per share and deposits per share have grown at a compound annual rates of 16% and 13%, respectively.","Operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 77 basis points. This decline was driven by both a larger balance sheet and a lower net interest margin. Progress will be driven by loan and deposit growth, a stabilized net interest margin, fee income growth and a disciplined approach to expenses. Further in the future, with our highly asset sensitive balance sheet, we look forward to rates returning to more historically normal levels.","Slide 14 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity on the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvement on this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our capital levels remain approximately 140 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity to tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that our return on average tangible equity is 10.6%.","On Slide 15, we see the capital levels at the holding company and the bank remains strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 9.6% and Tier 1 common at 12%. Which compares well to our peers at 8.2% and 10.5%, respectively.","At this point in a very long low interest rate cycle, we are taking actions to hold net interest income steady, increase fee income, reduce cost and return capital to shareholders while we strategically invest in the business for the years ahead. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contributed to a continued momentum in our franchise. The strength of our platform allows us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides a sustainable competitive advantage.","We will not take on unfamiliar credit risk or interest rate risk. When the environment does improve, we will be well positioned. This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","In the operating expense reconciliation, you detailed a $6.2 million write-down of banking house assets. I wondered if you could explain what that is. And also from which deal the $300,000 in acquisition costs come from?","Kirk W. Walters","The write-down in terms of banking assets, which is what we're reporting as nonoperating, is the branch closures, and the -- or is primarily the branch closures. And that was, we closed 4 branches out in New York in Long Island, which was when we announced the acquisition of the branches from Citizens, at the time we had said that we expected everything settled in to have some branch closures there. So 4 were in Long Island and 1 was in Connecticut here.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, by my calculation, Kirk, the earn-back on the buyback is a little over 8 years and obviously you have some tangible book dilution this quarter. Do you worry at all about buying your stock back at these levels and what it may do to your tangible book value?","Kirk W. Walters","Well I think there's a variety of factors that play into the buyback. I mean, we think about the impact in tangible book value. We also certainly think about continuing to get our dividend payout ratio down, which is a relevant factor in the equation and continuing to bring our capital into line with peers, so from an overall performance standpoint that we get more and more back in line. So I think there's a combination of things that we look at in analyzing the buyback and thinking about the process of doing that.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, on the margin. Did your assumption for the margin stabilizing here reflect the expectation for low interest rates for a while?","Kirk W. Walters","The answer is yes. And I would say they stabilized within the range and the guidance that we gave earlier in the year in January of 3.30% to 3.40%. I think as you look at the margin, the impact this quarter, there was a number of sort of structural items from the fact that in the fourth quarter of last year we built a larger securities portfolio. We kept that effectively flat, but we had it for the whole quarter. The senior notes that we issued in December, of course, we have for the whole quarter. So a number of items that were in there were structural items that we had pointed out last January is going to impact but stabilized within that range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, in terms of the buybacks stepping up this quarter given that your stock price was higher in 1Q than it was in 4Q. Is this a sign of maybe a lack of good M&A opportunities?","John P. Barnes","I mean we actually, we, as we've talked about in the past, we've got the higher level of authorization last year and we've continued to move in a consistent pattern, if you will, certainly increase the pace of the buyback now, but continued to move through those authorizations. And I think that we think of it separately, if you will, as compared to M&A activity.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, I would generally say that in the M&A space, as it has evolved over the last few years, even in smaller deals, there's very few deals that occur in the banking space that are straight-cash deals. So most of the deals have a significant component of equity that ends up being issued within the deal as well. So we do tend to think about them in different places.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But it's separate from opportunity for M&A, so what is the key variable? I think you were 56 million or so buyback the last quarter, and you're up to 144 million this quarter. So what was it that changed that drove the step up in buybacks?","Kirk W. Walters","Wow, I mean, a couple of things I would say. First the fact that it was late in last quarter that we raised the debt if you remember it's in early December, and received the approvals and such for the increased buybacks. So obviously we are limited in a quarter in terms of the periods in which we can buy back in the days and that activity there. So there's just a practical reality in there in terms of what we could do fourth quarter versus first quarter because everything we announced in both the debt and the buyback authorization was in early December.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So from this point forward, should we expect it around $140 million or so a quarter is that how we should think about it?","Kirk W. Walters","I think the pace that we did in the first quarter subject to market's liquidity and the standard caveats is consistent with the pace that you should expect.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just to follow up on Mark's question on the margin and stability, just curious in some of your assumptions. First do you plan on adding to the securities portfolio at all this year? And then maybe secondly, could you walk us through the strategy to grow DDA and is that at all to replace Homeland bank, advances or anything like that?","Kirk W. Walters","In terms of the securities portfolio, our expectation is we'll be holding it flat for the quarter or flat for the year. So as maturities and cash flow occurs, we'll reinvest that. But we won't be growing the securities portfolio. And I would remind you that the first quarter, of course, we lost 5 basis points in the margin because the calendar day count that gradually comes back in throughout the balance of the year as well. On the DDA growth side, if you look back at the acquisitions that we did, those entities in most cases had a lower DDA mix than what we as a total company had. And we think that as if you look at our overall cost of funds compared to a lot of our peers, we think the primary difference at this point, relates to the fact that our DDA mix is lower. So our expectation is that -- we've been very focused on growing DDAs, particularly in the standard markets that we've entered. And I think the activity all in all has been good and that will be used predominantly to fund loans as we're growing the loan books.","John P. Barnes","I'd just add, Steve, it's Jack, that there's a couple of things come to my mind in terms of kind of the strategy of doing it. One is that we continue to have a very active promotions within our retail banking group to build DDA across the franchise. And we are very effective at executing on those types of campaigns. And the other is in Business Banking, we are very focused on continuing to make progress in our Business Banking group and look at Business Banking as a key growth area in terms of deposits. We're very successful there. But we definitely believe we have room to improve the deposit to loan mix in our Business Banking group. So those are 2 big areas of focus on growing DDAs.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So Kirk, you say you're 3.30% to 3.40% margin for the rest of the quarter is for this year?","Kirk W. Walters","That's the guidance that we gave in January. And that continues to be our guidance for the margin. That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just to sort of take us back and ask sort of big picture conceptual question. On the 55% efficiency ratio that you guys have targeted for fourth quarter, it just seems like it's quite a leap from where we stand today. And the environment is still challenging. And just, can you just talk conceptually how you think you're going to get there within the business?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I would reference you back to the guidance that we gave in January in terms of where we are looking for loan growth and deposit growth, growing the balance sheet and continuing to grind away the expenses, while we're expanding our fee income. And that's the real equation to getting to that number. So we remain very focused on it. We know that it's not an easy goal to get to, particularly considering the expectation, this low interest rate environment for an extended period. But we, at this point, remain overall I'd say very focused on getting there. And it is through organically growing the balance sheet, but really grinding away at our other businesses both on a fee income side and in the expense side.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just sort of along those lines too, Kirk, when you think about \"normal earnings\" I mean how are you thinking about that? Because I guess I look at the business and I look at your balance sheet and with the pace of buybacks and the anticipated balance sheet growth that you're just talking about, you guys are going to kind of get to a pretty normal capital levels, it seems like by the end of this year. So to me, that seems normal in the sense of there's not additional levers that you really can pull once you sort of get there. So again, maybe kind of walk us through the progression of what normal means and how, where are the levers to get you there, what are we not seeing?","Kirk W. Walters","I'm not real sure what your question is, Collyn. If your question relates to do we think capital levels after we finish this buyback and if we continue to have good success on the loan growth front, at that point are getting closer and closer to the peer group, et cetera, the answer is yes. I think we are getting much closer there. I think normal, if you want to ask a question of what all of us would hope is a normal environment, somewhere down the road, is an environment where you have normal interest rates. And as you know we continue to have a very asset-sensitive balance sheet as we reported in the press release, 100 basis points with the $48 million on the net interest income and so, if that's the question, that's we've answered in there as well. But for right now, we're expecting that we will continue to have low rates. And that being said, we stuck to our net in, in terms of the percentage of our portfolios, the floating rate, we've continued to have relatively low durations on the securities portfolio and continue to grind away at our businesses and expanding them.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. That's helpful. And then just one final question, we had a smaller sort of merger of similar sizes in the New York market announced a few weeks ago. What do you guys think about that? I mean, sort of conceptually with the strains that have faced the industry, and do you think those types of mergers make sense? Could you all see yourselves doing something like that? If you could just kind of give us your thoughts on the notion of sort of mergers of similar size, just to try to get some economies of scale and cut costs.","John P. Barnes","Well, we think, we appreciate consolidation is a good idea in the industry. And we certainly are also appreciate the markets that deal took place. And obviously very active in wanting to grow our presence there as well. So in relation to our own appetite for those types of deals, we certainly, those opportunities, there are a few for us and we continue to work at relationships over time and think about those types of opportunities no different than the rest of the alternatives that are out there for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On the commercial banking growth that you outlined, the $498 million, could you just talk about the yield that you're getting on both C&I and CRE during the quarter on new originations?","Kirk W. Walters","As we've discussed in the past, we don't give out really specific yields because we do tend to be very focused on spreads. But I think when you look at overall spreads, what we saw on a linked quarter basis was a pretty consistent spreads overall on commercial loans or spread of all the businesses run to a little over 300 basis points or right around 300 basis points over the underlying indices relating to those loans. With a range of probably on the lower end in some of the businesses of 260 to higher end in terms of 370, 380 with the clear outlier being the People's United Equipment Finance business, the old FinFed, which has quite a bit higher spreads.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And would the low end of that range, the 260, be the multifamily product priced over 5-year treasuries, I assume?","Kirk W. Walters","No, probably the lower end, if you're looking at the averages of our businesses and we don't give out information directly on multifamily. We do in terms of our overall CREs, but if you look at the lower end of that business, it'd probably be in some of the really high quality middle market C&I type credits.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Next question, the allowance for originated loans has been drifting down, they are 88 basis points. Is that kind of the low point here, they're going to stabilize and will provisions going forward going to match the growth in charge-offs?","Kirk W. Walters","No we don't really -- as we go through the process, we really don't focus on an absolute number. I think we give you a lot of detail in our slide deck, which looks at the amount that we have against commercial loans, the amount we have against retail loans. And we have excellent coverage in the commercial portfolio in terms of the allowance not only against NPAs but in overall levels, especially considering our history. And a significant part of our prevision every quarter that we're putting away is for the new loan growth. So we do, over time, that probably will stabilize in a little bit better, but we really look at in the pieces that we've given you the detail that's in the Appendix of the slide deck.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Last question just on your deposit service charges, down 4% this quarter, 5% last quarter. I mean how much of these changes are seasonal versus secular changes in consumer behavior, particularly in overdraft? And where you think that's going?","John P. Barnes","So from our perspective, as we look at the first quarter and our historical results, first quarter is typically low for us. And we think that, that has a lot to do with our customer base and the levels of deposits that they carry on a seasonal basis in the first quarter versus others. And that impact things like the number of overdrafts and other things that occur. So a variety of things that would tell us it's more, we think it's more seasonal and history tells us that. And we don't think there's any long-term change in customer behavior.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I would just want a clarity. I'm not sure if I understood you right or not, Kirk. But did you say as far as share repurchases go, do you expect a similar pace market conditions permitting through the rest of the year as the first quarter? So basically 11 million shares a quarter, give or take?","Kirk W. Walters","No, what I was responding to when the question came up earlier from Steve is obviously we are limited by authorization out there of 10%. So if you look at the pace that we would be exercising that authorization, subject to market conditions and a variety of things, one, we would certainly expect to complete that authorization this year and the pace could be similar to what we saw in the first quarter, which means that might be done a little earlier.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, that helps. And then as you think about sort of longer term, I know you've announced about capital a few ways, I mean completing the authorization does bring capital down sort of more in line with peers. Next year, do you sort of go back to the historical pace of 5% of shares outstanding or how do you think about longer term, the buyback opportunity?","Kirk W. Walters","We, at this point, really given no guidance after this year regarding any buy back activity. I think a lot of it will continue to be focused on the rate of growth that we have in our loan portfolio and overall what's going on with the balance sheet and also what goes on with the finalization of Basel III rigs and a variety of things. So the only guidance we're giving at this point is in relation to the existing authorization that we have in place.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then can you tell me with the $6.2 million write-down related to the branch closures, what line is that actually in, is it in the other line?","Kirk W. Walters","If you look at the P&L, yes, that's in the other lines.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then as you think about the seasonal impact of the higher FICO expenses, et cetera, this quarter, how much improvement is there sequentially next quarter? How much will expenses come down just from the seasonal factors?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the seasonal factors relating to FICO, the 401(k) matches and some of that is about $3 million.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Great. And then lastly, I sort of want to touch a little more on margin. I know you all said you continue to think you'll be in 3.30% to 3.40% range for the year. Is that a full year number or are you saying that in every quarter of the year you guys are going to be within that range?","Kirk W. Walters","The guidance that we've given is for the year as a whole. So in terms of that range, 3.30% to 3.40% is for the year as a whole.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then since you're at 3.38% today and you guys are saying that margin has hopefully now largely stabilized, does that suggest you could be closer to the high end of the range or does stabilize sort of mean you're not going to see 25 basis points because there were a lot of sort of unusual factors this quarter and the pace continues down but just at a much more manageable pace?","Kirk W. Walters","What we're referencing in stabilized is stabilized within that range of 3.30% to 3.40% for the year and I think you hit the nail on the head that we did have a lot of what I would say our most structural items that were very apparent when we've announced earnings for the fourth quarter and were embedded in the margin guidance that we gave you in January and things we pointed out in January.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. But I guess certainly stabilized doesn't mean stable overall because you still do have the pressure from loan yields and the higher-yielding acquired loans wearing off, et cetera?","Kirk W. Walters","Exactly. We still -- once again, we've given guidance within the range of 3.30% to 3.40%. I think that's pretty tight guidance to be put out there and we certainly have given you all the pieces here just to see how things move back and forth. And I'd remind everybody once again that we gave up 5 basis points on calendar days and as the year goes, you get that back in.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I saw the short-term borrowings ticked up again this quarter. I was just wondering if the NIM guide for this year relies on more tapping the short-term borrowings.","Kirk W. Walters","No, I think what's impacting the short-term borrowings really is the, a, the pace of loan growth, which continued to be very good this quarter and we're certainly very pleased with it. And the fact is seasonality in our deposit bases and as you can see, we do tend to have some seasonality, particularly over on the commercial side but also within the retail side as well. So that tends to drive more where we're at in the borrowing. Certainly our preference remains to be deposit funded, we remain very focused on them.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just sort of a longer term question. You guys obviously show up pretty well on assimilation tables for higher rates. And I can certainly appreciate that the C&I, the floating rate loans are 40%. But there should be -- there's decent interest rate risk in some of the other buckets, commercial real estate and resi mortgage. I'm just a little surprised to see such a strong move and then I was wondering if you could talk me through that and what am I missing?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the overall level of floating rate loans that we have I think you referenced a 40% number it's probably closer to 35%, 36% in terms of the overall. But that is, those loans are primarily tied to 1 month LIBOR prime. And so when rates do move, those move fairly quickly. And also we've structured our securities portfolio in a way that we have significant cash flow coming off every month, so, and when you look at a lot of the other loans and such that we have on the books, overall, you tend to see shorter tenures and good cash flow off those as well. So that asset sensitivity number we've been reporting has been pretty consistent, really flex the consistency of the balance sheet, mix of businesses and how we run the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Bruce with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Karti Bhatt","It's actually Karti Bhatt on for Ken Bruce. Most of my questions have been answered, just one quick one. On OpEx, I mean, you talked about some seasonal aspects but is there any more room to run and just squeezing expenses, core expenses down further?","Kirk W. Walters","We gave guidance earlier in the year in terms of a range. And we are continuing to, quarter-after-quarter, grind out that number and grind it down and continue to take actions such as you saw this quarter with some more consolidation of branches and looking at different items. So the answer is, yes, we believe that we can continue to grind it down while it come in huge pieces, no, but we are very focused on it with the internal processes and everything that we are doing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Kirk, you touched on the accretion add to the margin of 14 bps this quarter. Are there any lumpy drop offs in that coming up this year in 2014?","Kirk W. Walters","In terms of the impact on the overall margin on the accretion side and you're referencing our one table that we have in there, which I'm glad you're using it. But to the question is it lumpy at this point? No. I mean we sort of worked our way through the old FinFed acquisition, which was lumpiest part for us because those were short duration assets and now we're into a much steadier runoff in terms of the portfolio.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And should we expect most of that to be gone by 2014 or does that push into 2015?","Kirk W. Walters","We haven't given a guidance as to the remaining duration of that portfolio. They typically were bank like assets, probably some remaining focus in the commercial real estate area and so the tenor is probably a little longer than what you're talking about.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And just going back to what you were saying earlier on the loan spreads. It sounds like incremental loan production yields are still below the originated portfolio yields. So just trying to figure out where the margin stability or the relative stability is going to come from if originated book yields are still moving lower while the accretion is just going to gradually decline. Are you still looking for a maybe decent opportunity to move funding costs lower?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I mean, it's a couple of things. First, I'll remind you that we put out the range of the margin of 3.30% to 3.40% and that's the context in which we're making our comments. I think if you look at the overall new yield on loans coming in at this point for overall for the loan portfolio, it's within 25 to 30 basis points of existing yields in the portfolio. So we do see it stabilizing more there. And we, also, as we've pointed out earlier, first quarter is always tough on us on a day count standpoint and you get that coming back in as well. On the funding side, our biggest opportunities come from 2 places. Really the acquired deposits still are the relatively high rate and those will roll off as in many cases the CDs mature and such and gives us an opportunity. And that relates to about 15% of our portfolio. And the other part is with Jack's comments earlier on the growing the noninterest bearing deposits and getting them back to levels that were consistent with what we had before we did all the acquisitions. So those are the other opportunities that we're very focused on that will continue to help mitigate some of the natural pressure that you have in terms of portfolio.","David Rochester - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just one last one. You had mentioned, I think, just under $200 million of your CRE came from New York. I was Just wondering how much of that was multifamily? And if you can talk about the competitive dynamics you're seeing there?","Kirk W. Walters","The majority of what we have coming out of New York is multifamily. And as I've been very familiar with that market for a long time, and it is a very competitive market. But we overall entered the market with an extremely experienced team of folks that are very focused on overall relationships and accordingly, and also focused on making sure that the flow of product is not on the larger loans but in particular on the smaller loans, where the price and dynamics remain for all intents and purposes, reasonable.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. Just had a quick question on loan growth. How much did mortgage warehouse lending contributed to the loan growth this quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Actually if you look at mortgage warehouse lending and we gave some guidance on this in January as well, we actually saw that come down on a linked quarter basis. In the fourth quarter, the utilization rates in mortgage warehouse were very high. And as we came into this quarter, we saw the overall warehouse lending come down into a little more, still on the higher end, but a little more normal utilization rate. So they did not contribute to the growth this quarter.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then are you still comfortable with the high single digit to mid-teens loan growth outlook for the year?","John P. Barnes","Yes, we are. One of the nice things about this quarter, outside of the growth that we've got from the New York commercial real estate, we had very good performance across all of the markets and business lines generally. So we're very pleased with how we're moving forward.","Kirk W. Walters","And I think the other item that's important to note is that the pace of runoff on the acquired loans came back within our expectations. So that certainly helps in terms of giving comfort to that original guidance.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly coming back to the NIM. Regarding the competitive landscape out there, are you still seeing the similar degree of loan pricing competition in the markets today in terms of pricing and structure? And is there any particular market or loan type where the competition has kind of recently picked up?","John P. Barnes","I think generally we are seeing very competitive environment again across all, in all the markets and in all business lines. Everybody is competing very hard to grow assets in this environment. We are sticking to our fundamental approaches there and we're certainly not willing to stretch on asset quality and underwriting standards, but we are seeing a very competitive environment in terms of pricing.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for our closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you again for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our fourth quarter results. Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of our presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. Appreciate you joining us today. As has become our custom, in addition to reviewing the fourth quarter results, I'd like to reflect on the past year, as well as our goals for 2013. You'll recall that since I took over as CEO in mid-2010, we have had 2 primary objectives, optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital. In 2012, we executed well against both of these goals. 2012 was a year in which we continued to take action to enhance growth opportunities by expanding existing business lines and deepening our market presence. Our people made this progress possible by building new relationships across our footprint. We are also in a fortunate position to have outstanding fundamentals which allows us to continue to attract and retain talent throughout our franchise. We experienced growth in essentially every loan product and every fee income business, and we were able to grow loans at faster than market rates by bolstering our capabilities and a few underrepresented asset classes, including asset-based lending, New York commercial real estate, mortgage warehouse lending, private banking and wealth management. In addition, we extended our presence in Metro New York through the acquisition of 57 branches in Southern New York and also opened a flagship branch in Midtown Manhattan. These branches represent a significant source of future low-cost funding, asset-generation and an important connection with the current and future customers. We are able to make progress while interest rates remain low, and in fact, fell 30% at the short end of the yield curve since the beginning of 2012. As a reminder, approximately 35% of our loan portfolio is comprised of floating rate loans tied to short rates. Our progress allowed us to grow loans per share by 12% and deposits per share by 9% in 2012. Operating earnings grew 10% year-over-year to $254 million and our operating earnings per share grew 14% to $0.75. Our operating return on average assets was 90 basis points, up 1 basis point over 2011. Operating return on average tangible equity improved 130 basis points as we increased earnings and returned capital via dividends and share repurchases. Our revenue growth and highly disciplined approach to expenses drove the efficiency ratio from 64% in 2011 to 62.4% in 2012. In addition, asset quality strengthened further from the existing industry-leading levels.","On Slide 3, you can see our total loans and deposits grew 7% and 4%, respectively, which provides a good link to Slide 4. Slide 4 shows that our growth in loans and deposits was offset by lower interest rates which combined to produce relatively flat net interest income and revenue. Efficiency ratio improvements combined with our share repurchases serve to boost earnings per share by 14% year-over-year. As we mentioned at the start of the call, our rate environment will likely mask some of the benefits of the larger balance sheet at least as seen through the net interest income line. However, fee income growth, a disciplined approach to expenses and attractive -- excuse me, active capital management will continue to drive earnings per share progress. We have 6 goals for 2013: grow loans at high single digits to mid-teen rates by a momentum from current initiatives combined with slower loan runoff from the acquired loan portfolio. Second, increase deposits at a mid-single-digit rate. Third, maintain net interest income in the $900 million to $940 million range, which implies a 3.3% to 3.4% net interest margin. Grow fee income at mid-single-digit rate. Hold full year operating expenses flat at $815 million to $825 million. This effectively is a reduction considering the additional expenses we absorbed associated with our recent Southern New York branch acquisition in the middle of last year. And sixth, to preserve our fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency ratio goal late in 2014. Given the lower rate environment, our low risk profile, the natural position of our balance sheet towards floating rate loans and short duration investments, our 1.25% return on average assets goal is attainable, but in the near term, we probably need short rates to rise a bit. With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter in more detail.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 6, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $63.2 million or $0.19 per share with net income of $61.2 million or $0.18 per share. The operating net interest margin declined by 19 basis points to 3.63% compared to 3.82% in the third quarter. The decline is largely the result of lower loan yields driven by strong loan originations, lower accretion on acquired loans and a slightly larger securities portfolio. Loans grew at a 13.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter driven by strong commercial loan growth. The efficiency ratio for the quarter rose to 63.1% from 61.4% in the third quarter primarily due to lower income from acquired loans. Net charge-offs remain low at 19 basis points compared to 18 basis points last quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 4.7 million shares at a weighted average price of $11.95 or $56.3 million. We also announced a new share repurchase authorization for another 10% of our outstanding shares. This new share repurchase program will be financed with cash on hand, as well as the proceeds from our $500 million senior notes offering priced at 3.65% in December. Capital ratios remain strong, we continue to deploy capital through organic growth, dividends and share repurchases. The tangible equity ratio stands at 10.2% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2012.","On Slide 7, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined steadily in 2012 as acquired loans ran off, longer term fixed-rate loans continued to reprice and our new loan originations grew at a faster rate in the latter half of the year. There is no difference between reported margin and operating margin this quarter as we did not experience any cost recovery income in the fourth quarter.","On Slide 8, you can see a breakdown of elements contributing to our 3.63% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, third quarter operating net interest margin was 3.82%. The effects of lower yielding new loan volume and acquired loan accretion reduced the margin by 7 basis points and 5 basis points, respectively. We also lost 2 basis points related to loan repricing and amortization this quarter. The decision to run a slightly larger securities portfolio pressured our margin by 4 basis points. The securities portfolio represents 15% of total assets, which although up from the middle of last year, remains below our peer median. The previously discussed senior note offering and the expiration of fair value amortization adjustments associated with Danvers time deposits negatively impacted our margin by 2 basis points. These changes are partially offset by a 3 basis point improvement in deposit costs.","Next quarter, we will have a full quarter of interest expense associated with our recently issued senior notes. In the quarters ahead, we will be working hard to increase the mix of DDAs to help offset some of the decline in loan yields. However, the primary determinant of the pace of the margin decline in the quarters ahead will be the pace of loan originations.","Slide 9 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $42 million and the carrying amount of acquired loans to period end totaled $2.2 billion, down from $2.6 billion last quarter and $3.6 billion one year ago. All of these portfolios are seasoned at this point, and since we aggressively dealt with some of the more troubled loans first, we continue to believe that the acquisition date credit marks will, in the aggregate, prove to be sufficient.","Slide 10 illustrates the amount of non-cash accretion running through our income statement. If you go to the top left, you will see that we booked total accretion of $42 million this quarter, which when you annualize and divide by the average balance to the acquired loan portfolio gives us an effective yield of 6.86%. The weighted average coupon in the acquired loan portfolio is 5.27%. This was the actual cash coming in from the acquired loans. The difference between the 6.86% effective yield and the weighted average coupon of 5.27% amounts to $9.7 million of additional interest income from the amortization of the original discount on the acquired loan portfolio. Annualized in this number and dividing it by the adjusted average earning assets in the fourth quarter shows that 15 basis points of our operating net interest margin during the quarter relates to noncash accretion. So if you wanted to think about our core underlying margin, excluding the noncash accretion, it would be our operating net interest margin at 3.63% less than 15 basis points or 3.48%. The noncash accretion was equivalent to $0.02 per share this quarter as shown on the right-hand side of the page, which is similar to prior quarters.","Over time, as the acquired loans repay, mature or settled, the amortization of original discount will dissipate. At the same time, it is possible that we may also experience reclassifications from the non-accretable difference to accretable yield due to better-than-expected credit performance.","Slide 11 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. Our loan portfolio produced total growth of 13.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized. This is a testament to the number of loan initiatives we have focused on over the past year, as well as our deepening market presence. The growth is particularly notable considering the degree of acquired loan runoff, which we expect will slow in the quarters ahead due to a combination of or limited opportunity for problem asset resolutions. Significant progress has already been made on the problem assets as evidenced by the decline in the level of acquired non-performing loans. Further portfolio seasoning, which is expected to reduce the level of outflows given the fact that these acquisitions have all anniversaried at least 1 year, and the remaining portfolio composition, which reflects longer duration assets such as commercial real estate loans and residential mortgages.","Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Commercial real estate contributed 38% or $412 million, including $146 million from New York commercial real estate. The portfolio remains broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. C&I contributed 44% or $477 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 3 businesses: Mortgage warehouse lending grew $117 million in the quarter. PCLC, our equipment finance business, grew $123 million in the quarter; and People's United Equipment Finance increased $61 million.","Residential mortgages added only 2% or $22 million. This relatively flat growth does not tell the full story as we originated $491 million of residential mortgages this quarter, $263 million of which was put into portfolio, primarily hybrid ARMs, while the other $228 million was sold. 86% of the residential mortgage originations held for investment were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. Fourth quarter of '12 originations average loan size is $587,000, average FICO score was 760 with an average LTV of 65%. The residential mortgage pipeline is up 2% quarter-over-quarter and 56% of the pipeline is Jumbo product. One positive of all the mortgage banking activity is strong gain on sale income, a trend which is likely to continue for at least the early part of 2013.","New home equity commitment closings totaled $172 million compared to $197 million in the third quarter of '12. In terms of recent originations, the average loan or line size of the fourth quarter '12 originations was $135,000, average FICO score was 758 with an average combined LTV of 58%. 100% of home equity loans are retail-originated.","You can see on Slide 12, a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Commercial deposits increased $264 million and retail deposits increased by $124 million. We continue to improve the mix of our deposit base. The main deposits increased $171 million, while time deposits decreased $180 million. The improved deposit mix and efforts throughout our franchise to lower deposit cost, particularly in the acquired market, contributed to a further 3 basis point decline in deposit cost excluding fair value adjustments. More broadly, I am encouraged to see that we experienced DDA growth of 13% year-over-year. The larger deposit gathering opportunities in front of us relate to continuing to increase our deposit mix in favor of both retail and commercial non-interest-bearing deposits and better utilization of our Southern New York branches. For example, we have already witnessed 28% annualized deposit growth in our acquired New York branches in 2012.","Slide 13 provides a breakout of noninterest income, which increased $2.9 million from the second -- third quarter. Insurance and bank service charges both had a seasonally weaker quarter. Insurance tends to be lightest in the fourth quarter, while bank service charges were impacted by fees waived in the wake of super storm Sandy and higher seasonal check and balances in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. However, these declines were more than offset by a few positives, most notably gain on loan sales was up $2.8 million over what was a strong third quarter, and loan prepayment fees increased by $2.7 million.","On Slide 14, we illustrate the key components of our changes in noninterest expense. Lower incentive cost, which is driven by the benefit associated with the final vesting of the initial stock awards granted in 2007 at the time when the company's second step conversion and reduced REO expenses combined to improve operating expenses by $4.2 million. Occupancy and equipment cost increased $1.9 million, reflecting higher cost associated with weather-related events including super storm Sandy and other maintenance expenses. Professional and outside service costs also increased $1.5 million due to project-related administrative services. The net impact was a $1.2 million reduction in operating expenses for the quarter.","Side 15 details the key drivers of our fourth quarter efficiency ratio. Lower income on acquired loans negatively impacted the efficiency ratio of 2.2%. An increase in other net interest income and noninterest income combined to help the efficiency ratio by 1%. Lower operating expenses positively impacted efficiency ratio by 40 basis points. REO expenses, gains on branch sales and other adjustments had a negative 90 basis point impact on the efficiency ratio. Taken together, the efficiency ratio rose 1.7%. As we've grown organically and integrated our acquisitions, we successfully pushed the efficiency ratio down to a level in line with our peers. In the quarters ahead, loan, deposit and fee income growth combined with our disciplined approach to expenses will allow for additional progress.","The next slide details our progress on the efficiency ratio since the first quarter of 2010. As you can see, we have made significant progress over this time period. Slides 17 and 18 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again, we did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter from already industry-leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets at 1.48% of our originated loans in REO remain well below our peer group in top 50 banks and are down considerably from 2% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs were 19 basis points compared to 18 basis points last quarter and 29 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2011. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets and are well below peers. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 50% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues and typically have very few new credit events each quarter.","On Slide 19, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.13% with a coverage ratio of 95% of commercial NPLs, up from 82% last quarter. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mix shift in the new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any quarter. The provision for loan losses this quarter of $12 million reflects $10 million in net charge-offs, including $5.2 million with previously established specific reserves and $7.2 million associated with loan growth. The decline in nonperforming loans and additional provisioning bolstered total coverage of nonperformers to 70% from 66% in the prior quarter. Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 20 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on loan and deposit growth on a per-share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 14%, respectively.","On Slide 21, our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 87 basis points. This decline relates to having a larger balance sheet and a lower net interest margin. Progress will be driven by loan growth, aided by slower acquired loan runoff, fee income growth and a disciplined approach to expenses. Further in the future, with our highly asset-sensitive balance sheet, we look forward to rates returning to more historically normal levels.","Slide 22 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity from the low levels of 2010. We expect to see continued improvement on this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Still, our significant capital levels remain approximately 230 basis points over peers on a tangible common equity to tangible asset basis. Normalizing our equity base to be consistent with our peers shows that the bank is performing well with the return on average tangible equity of 11.8%.","Slide 23 demonstrates our substantial progress since 2010 on the dividend payout ratio. We expect progress to continue in the quarters ahead from improved profitability and continued share repurchase activity. We anticipate our recently announced share repurchase program will, depending on earnings, produce an improvement on a dividend payout ratio of 5% to 10%. Over time, we will expect our dividend payout ratio will trend still lower as we grow earnings and retire shares.","On Slide 24, we see that capital levels of the holding company and the bank remain strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 10.2% and Tier 1 common at 12.7%, which compares well to our peers at 7.9% and 10.7% as of the third quarter, respectively. At this point, in a very long, low rate cycle, we are focused on taking actions to enhance growth opportunities which will allow us to hold net interest income steady while increasing fee income, reducing cost and returning capital to shareholders. Our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to the continued momentum of our franchise. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provides us sustainable competitive advantage. We will not take on unfamiliar credit risk or interest rate risk. When the rate environment does change, we will be well positioned. This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer questions you may have. Operator, we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to start in terms of the loan growth guidance for 2013. Maybe first, how much of a headwind should we expect from the acquired loans? Is $800 million the reasonable rate which is annualized in 4Q?","John P. Barnes","The -- in terms of the runoff of acquired loans, the -- I mean 4Q was $400 million itself. But we do expect that to slow down so by an appreciable amount, probably a range of around 40%, somewhere around there. So $200 million to $250 million, in that range on a quarterly basis annualizing would be some general guidance on that.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Kirk, looking at the required growth, you would need to drive total loans in the highest single digit to mid-teens. Can you help us think about the sources of that growth? And then what gives you comfort at this stage that, that will materialize at that level in the backdrop of pretty difficult environment still being painted by most of your peers?","Kirk W. Walters","Let me take -- I'm going to take an initial crack and then have Jack add onto this. I mean, at the first part is that we do expect not only in the acquired loans, but in some of our other portfolios that the level of reductions that we've experienced will, in fact, slow a bit. And so that is embedded in there particularly on the acquired loans. And secondarily, I would say that one of the reasons that we are encouraged is that we continue to have good strong pipelines across all of our different portfolios going into the year in spite of a very strong fourth quarter. So with that, let me just turn it over to Jack and he could maybe talk a little more business-by-business.","John P. Barnes","I think we have been talking through the year, Steve, about the very nice progress that we've made in businesses like ABL mortgage warehouse lending. And I've also -- I know I've mentioned before and we've certainly ended the year strong across pieces of our core geography, particularly Connecticut C&I, even had a very strong 15% growth in New Hampshire C&I, for instance. So our -- across our geographies, our core commercial businesses are doing very nicely. And we had an excellent performance in our equipment finance and the other businesses that I mentioned. So we're feeling just very good about all of our business lines and our presence in the relationship building in the core franchise. I know I mentioned during the year our work around building C&I in our Long Island market in New York. We had a 33% growth rate there this year. So when you start to kind of break it down by how we're doing in different business lines across the footprint, we're getting very, very good momentum and traction. We actually would have done much better this year if we didn't have the payoffs that we experienced that slowed the rate of growth. And we don't expect that pace to be the same this year.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just one final one on the expense guidance. I guess the run rate of operating expenses around $818 million, and you're guiding it to $815 to $825 million. Does this imply that the bulk of the cost-cutting initiatives are now behind you essentially?","Kirk W. Walters","I think as far as what it implies is if we think about that number in the range that we've given, effectively that is assuming that we are taking out additional cost as we go forward into '13 because we would have had a full year of expenses on the branches that we acquired from Citizens, which, that with couple other things, would've added about $20 million on to our run rate, and in fact what we're implying is that we'd be holding the run rate constant. So there are continuing initiatives underway to, in this case, hold expenses at this level, and we will be -- continue to be very focused on the expense number and working of ways to bring the absolute level of expenses down.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to kind of ask sort of a big picture question. It seems as if I understand, the commentary obviously about the portfolios that the run-off is slowing and in the momentum that you've been carrying as the years gone on. But it still seems like there's been a bit of maybe a strategic change in how you're looking at the environment, I mean with kind of your guided growth rates to be twice the level of pretty much what we saw in 2012. Is that the case? I mean, do you see something here that's causing you to sort of accelerate your growth plans? And then also, two, just thinking about the funding of it? Because when you -- with the guidance terms you gave for 2013, it looks like you're going to utilize borrowings in a much better or a much more aggressive way. And then I guess part B of this question would be how does this sort of fit in with the share repurchase authorization of the 30 million shares? Again, at that point, it seems like you were -- maybe were going to pursue a more conservative growth path, utilizing the capital to buy back stock. So just -- sorry, it's a long wind, it's a little all over the place. But just trying to sort of reconcile the sort of the moving parts of this, what seems like a pretty aggressive growth plan for you all in coming forth?","Kirk W. Walters","Let me -- Collyn, it's Kirk. Let me -- I'll take the first crack at it, and then Jack will chime in. In terms of sort of the 3 embedded questions you had there. As far as loan growth, I think part of our encouragement and a little more bullishness really is from what occurred in the third and fourth quarter. In the third quarter, toward the end of the third quarter, we did have good solid loan growth that continued into the fourth quarter in terms of seeing loan growth across all of our portfolios and continued progress. I think we also are seeing the results of all the additional people we've hired, new bigger markets we're operating in, the different branches and such that we've either de novo-ed or acquired, getting up and operating in a larger presence in those. So I think it's a variety of factors that we're feeling more confidence in our ability to really grow and realize on those, including the various initiatives we've taken. The fact that now on all those initiatives, people are there clearly up and operating, by year end, pretty well at full speed. In terms of funding, the -- certainly this could require some more wholesale funding. As you know, we have very little wholesale funding on our books that actually comes on in a rate lower than where our deposits are. And assuming the high end of the loan growth, you would have some modest additional borrowings that we would put on. As far as repurchasing shares, we don't believe the guidance here changes the game plan there. We raised the $500 million to use at the holding company as liquidity. To fund the repurchase, we have historically performed on our repurchases in terms of buying the shares and pretty well ratably over the year. And obviously, from a pure economic standpoint, the debt we issued was 10-year debt, which on an after-tax basis was around 2.2%, 2.3% and we'd be retiring shares or paying dividends on, that has a yield of over 5%. And we still, even with this buyback, continue to have strong capital ratios. With that, let me turn it to Jack for a minute.","John P. Barnes","Just to circle on the beginning of it, Collyn. Regarding strategy, if you really step back and you think about the acquisitions we made that included getting ourselves into larger markets in New York and Boston, and we've hired a lot of talent there to help us. And now that momentum is paying off. We also -- we announced things like the commercial real estate initiative and a number of other initiatives through the period all tied to that strategy of allowing the company to grow at a faster rate than the industry, if you will, averages and putting ourselves in a position to take advantage of our -- the way we operate and the opportunity we have in the Northeast corridor. So it very much ties to the strategy.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Quick question for you on credit trends. The numbers that were reported were favorable quarter-over-quarter for sure. Looks like there's a little bit of movement within the resi and the home equity portfolio. Was that due to the new Chapter 7 OCC regulation?","Kirk W. Walters","The answer is yes. There were a couple other legs to that. We really had no P&L impact and such around that. But in terms of the increased NPLs and such, that is in relation to the new OCC guidance.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Have all of the appraisals been completed on the portfolio?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes.","John P. Barnes","Yes. We were doing that before. We were there already on that one, Damon.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then kind of in step with credit here on the provision expense. As you continue to see the strong loan growth, should we expect to see a bit of an uptick in the provision level versus like what we saw this quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think if you look at this quarter, out of the $12 million provision, $7.2 million related to growth in the loan portfolio. So we have a very good, detailed allowance process where each new loan is coming on. We're putting something away for rainy days. So certainly, if loan growth accelerates from the level that we have in the fourth quarter, you would see a little bigger provision. If it slowed down, it could be a little smaller. But like I say, about $7 million to $12 million was related to loan growth for this quarter.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess, just my last question. It looks like the growth in securities and the FHLB advances came towards the end of the quarter. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're buying on the securities side and what the funding looked look like on the advances?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. The -- in terms of the securities side, we continue to buy really relatively short CMOs, same structure that we have been buying. And we've been adding a little bit as we've been going to our municipal portfolio. Duration in the portfolio is just a couple of ticks over 3 years, and we've been trying to pretty well keep it right around that 3-year benchmark. And it's also set up in a way that we do have fairly significant cash flow on a monthly basis coming off of it that we would expect to reinvest in '13 but would also be available to us if we wanted the liquidity.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the -- of the advances, did they just -- what's the duration on those?","Kirk W. Walters","The advances that we have out there are relatively short, 1 year to 2-year type advances.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just sort of following Damon's question about the securities book. I know you all said that securities are a bigger piece of assets but still small relative to the peer group. Is 15% a level that you want to keep it at? Will you continue to grow the securities portfolio faster than you have in the past or maybe in line with the loan book? Or how are you thinking about the prospects for continued securities portfolio growth over 2013?","Kirk W. Walters","We would expect, when you look at the level of the investment portfolio right now, that, that to remain fairly constant throughout '13 and keeping it probably at 15% of assets or lower.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then since it looks like the securities sort of came on late in the quarter, would that suggest that the margin compression that you all expect in 2013 will be certainly, to some extent, front-end loaded and you'll see a lot of that pressure on the first quarter of 2013 and less as you work through the year?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. As we go into -- it's an excellent question. As we go into the first quarter next year, I mean there's a couple of factors that definitely will put a little pressure on the margin. One is the investments, as you know there, that will have a full quarter of the impact of the investments on the margin. Also the senior notes obviously came on in the middle of the quarter and accordingly would be on for the full quarter. So both of those will have a full quarter's impact in first quarter and then will flatten out as we go into the balance of the year.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then last question. The deposit fees this quarter looked a little light to me, and I wasn't sure if there was anything that might have affected that or any thoughts there?","Kirk W. Walters","You're right. They are a little light this quarter. And the -- one, just from a general concept, fourth quarter tends to be our lighter quarter in terms of, on a seasonal basis, deposit fees. It tends to be a quarter that has a very good deposit growth, and we see less of DCs. But we did have the impact of super storm Sandy, get all my Ss out here, in that number that impacted it as well.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I would assume that fee waivers from Sandy are now behind us, and so you would expect that line item to be up in the first quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Stern Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just wondering how big is the mortgage warehouse now in terms of the total balance, and what are you getting for a rate on that?","Kirk W. Walters","The -- in terms of the overall rate on the mortgage warehouse, as you know, we really tend to discuss spreads. We tend to think very much as a commercial bank in terms of overall spreads on mortgage warehouse. And the spreads have been very consistent over the year in terms of that business, ranging probably between 3.45 to 3.75. In terms of outstandings on that, the balance is a little over $700 million.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay got you. And then you'd mentioned that of the roughly $300 million in commercial real estate growth, I think there's $146 million that came from the Metro New York region. Is that mostly multi-family, and what were those yields in terms of originations during the quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","The -- what came out of the New York CRE group was largely multi-family. And I can say once again, we really tend to think about this in spreads. And so the spreads are running around 2.25 to 2.75 depending on the credits -- spreads, yes.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And how much products were you doing kind of -- how much went beyond 5 years, the traditional 5-year fixed? Anything longer than that? Or what was the breakdown in average maturity?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. We haven't necessarily put that out there. But just in terms of thinking about it from a memory standpoint, there were some over 5 years. But I would say it probably wasn't a lot of that number.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then just going back to the warehouse, I know that you had acquired a team to kind of build out that line of business. Have they essentially transitioned most of their portfolio now at $700 million or do you expect that to become a larger balance as well in the year ahead?","John P. Barnes","Well, there's 2 things going on there. We do expect that they'll continue to build relationships, and they've done -- they've made a lot of progress but we feel like there's more to go. On the other hand, as the refinancing begins to slow, the line utilization will start to back off from the high levels that we've hit here in the last few quarters. So there'll be a dynamic going on there this year that we'll be expecting to make progress, but it won't be at the pace that -- certainly that we had this year.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on the securities that you purchase, what was the actual yield that you generated on the new securities in the quarter with all that liquidity that you put to work?","Kirk W. Walters","The yield on the CMOs that we're buying is around 1.25%.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the munis in the low 2s, mid-2s or...","Kirk W. Walters","More toward the mid-2s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on the margin outlook. I understand the guide for this year, it looks like 3.30%, 3.40%. That implies a pretty rapid pace of compression per quarter. I know it's very early for '14, but I was just wondering what's your best guess in terms of how that -- does that stabilize in '14? Or do you see that continuing?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think the primary driver that the decline in the margin will be loan originations. So as you see our success at continuing to grow loans and new volume coming on, that's a primary factor that is driving that margin down over the year.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I mean both -- so assuming loan growth continues in '14, do we get some -- a slower rate of change on the compression side as we reach stability?","Kirk W. Walters","I mean, I think if we look where spreads are today and saying rates are relatively consistent with where they are today, we would expect certainly stabilization in the margin in '14 and maybe even later in '13.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple of questions on capital. First, just to clarify. So the -- using the buyback to improve the dividend payout ratio, is it correct to assume that will continue at $5 million of shares per quarter? Or are you looking to utilize that 10% all in 2013?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, I think as we commented earlier, we would expect to complete the share repurchase program in the year of 2013 ratably over the year.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, I got you. And then just lastly, any updated thoughts on the M&A environment? Do you feel like it's loosening up in your footprint, and what's your appetite there?","John P. Barnes","Well, I'd say it's -- we're very much kind of where we have been. We continue to actively build relationships, and we certainly have an obligation and we do look at the marketplace. But I don't sense any big change, and I think it's a fairly difficult environment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Warner -- I apologize. Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore Partners.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Kirk, can you talk a little bit more about how the margin is coming in versus your expectations? I know you mentioned that loan growth is a contributing factor to the downside moving the margin and also your compression expectations going into '13. Outside of the loan growth, though, can you talk about other factors that are impacting your margin expectation here and how that might be different than what you initially expected.","Kirk W. Walters","Well, if we refer back to Slide 8 that we, I think, gave a pretty good waterfall of what was driving the margin compression. I think what you see is really our ability to adjust deposit cost, the mix there largely offset the repricing amortization that occurred in the portfolios. So similar to answers to some of their earlier questions, we did increase investment portfolio. Part of that is reflected in this quarter. Next quarter will have a full impact of that. We did issue the senior notes this quarter. Part of it is in the quarter, but as we go to next year, we'll see a full year impact of that. And as far as acquired loan accretion, those loans continue to pay down and accordingly that there will be some impact from that. But probably, the biggest fundamental driver as we go into next year will be the new loan volume coming on at rates lower than where the portfolio is currently at today.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then in terms of the securities investments, how much of that incremental additions to the securities book do you -- would expect here would be, I guess, delivered investments funded by borrowings in FHLB advances? I'm just trying to gauge how much more leveraging of the balance sheet you're going to do here as you build up the securities book versus just funding it with the excess deposits.","Kirk W. Walters","I mean as I mentioned earlier with some questions around this, we don't expect this balance to increase from where we're at, if you're looking at ending balances. We do expect to hold the balance throughout the year so we will be reinvesting the cash flows that comes off. And obviously, some of it was funded through borrowings but we do expect to continue to have good solid deposit growth, which would go into next year, which will be the primary funding vehicle. And then it'll be just a question of how strong the loan growth is.","John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. Then lastly, your comp expense, it came down nicely in the quarter. And -- however, your other -- all other expenses were a little bit higher than what I'd initially expected. So could you just give a little bit of color around what you're seeing in terms of your cost reduction efforts?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, I think we have a little bit of sort of mix and match in there. I mentioned earlier that the grants, the stock grants were -- that were done in 2007 when the company did the second step, finished their vesting in the fourth quarter. Grants that were to employees or officers go through comp expense. Grants that were to board members go through other expense. And as we finish the vesting and all the related true-ups to that, that was the primary contributor to the decrease in comp expenses for the quarter and was also the primary contributor to the increase in other expenses on the other side because the way the calculations worked, one was a positive, one was a negative. The other thing is when you look at this quarter, we had a couple less workdays in there that impacted our comp expense as well. So as we get into next year, first quarter as usual, we tend to see comp expense go up with all the taxes and everything that was paid in the first quarter and then settle down from the seasonality effects of this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Keating with Barclays.","Matthew J. Keating - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You mentioned the strong deposit growth you're experiencing in the acquired southern New York branches. Can you just talk to whether or not that might accelerate plans for those branches to breakeven by 2014 at this point?","John P. Barnes","Well, I -- this is Jack, I'll take that. I would go 2 places. First, we accelerated the level of training and the pace of training that we asked those folks to take on in the transition more so than we had in previous integrations. They did very, very well. And with the -- our approach to customer experience and the training that we've done, we feel really good about how they have -- how they progress. We expect that, that pace of improvement and moving along the spectrum will continue. And we're really optimistic about how we got a great team there. I think that whether or not we're -- and it's too early, I think, to adjust the original timeline until we get further down the line, we're 6 months into it, if you will. But we appreciate the question. We'll...","Matthew J. Keating - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Understood, yes. I guess just speaking on that branch strategy, could you also -- I know it's very early on the flagship branch in Manhattan. But maybe just talk in broader terms about your Manhattan strategy, any early read on how the new branch is fitting with your strategy there?","John P. Barnes","Well, we really are focused primarily in Manhattan with working on the commuting lines that -- in the centers where our customers from Fairfield County and Long Island and Westchester County commute into the city, be convenient for them, be relevant. We -- and the flagship branch park is a great start. We've hired a great team there that were very experienced in the market. I'd say, again, it's been 1 month but the initial reaction has been great. We've -- we're raising deposits, which is great. And we're also getting visits to the branch from customers saying it's great to see my bank here. So we're -- the initial reaction is we're very excited about it. I think it's going to work out great.","Kirk W. Walters","And I would just make a few other comments in relation to that. For many of those customers that are walking by in the past, we have historically waived fees because we didn't have ATMs and such in the city. And so now, for many of those customers, we don't need to do that because we obviously have the ATMs and facilities right there in the city. Secondarily, that branch is only about 1.5 blocks from where our commercial real estate as well as asset-based lending operation is in the city. So it also provides the means that -- for the customers of those business lines to bank out of as well. So that's another plus of that branch. One of the items we'd like to -- or I'd like to remind folks of is under our model, one of the real pluses of the in-store branch is the asset generation. And I think the early feedback and what we've seen in terms of the level of applications that come in from home equities and resis, business banking loans and such, has been very good and actually probably a little bit ahead of what our original expectations were. So to Jack's comments, probably a little too early to call the ball whether it could move up from '14. But it does feel like that we certainly had a good start, particularly in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the time we have for questions.

And I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, First Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial, Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our fourth quarter results. Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of our presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. Now is a good time of the year to reflect on the past year, as well as our goals for 2012. You will recall that throughout 2011, we have had 2 primary objectives: optimizing existing businesses and efficiently deploying capital. In 2011, we executed well against both of these goals. We've now integrated 5 acquisitions since 2010 and taken out more cuts -- costs than were estimated at the time of each transaction. Integration and systems conversions have become a core competency for this organization. ","Further, we've become very focused on organic loan and deposit growth, having entered the large new markets of the Boston and New York City MSAs. Our momentum is based on our 170-year-old brand and outstanding customer service throughout the financial crisis. We offer the full breadth of products and services our customers need while providing a true relationship-based solution. All of this was accomplished while retaining strong asset quality, solid capital levels and a 5% dividend yield. ","Our 2011 financial results show substantial improvement. Operating earnings grew $112 million or 89% year-over-year. Likewise, our operating return on average assets was 91 basis points, up 34 basis points or 60% over 2010.","The primary driver behind our improvement has been and continues to be loan and deposit growth per share. During 2011, loans per share grew 20%, and deposits per share grew 18%.","I want to share 6 goals for 2012. First, grow loans in the mid-single digit to low double digits. Second, increase deposits in the mid-single digits. Third, strive to maintain a net interest margin above 4% for the first half of the year and minimize the decline below 4% for the second half. Fourth, reduce operating expenses to a run rate of $790 million to $810 million. Kirk will provide more detail. But at the highest level, we've accomplished 2 things. We have completed benchmarking process for the entire company and instituted a number of organizational changes; and second, we've established an expense management committee, which will manage costs from a horizontal perspective in addition to the traditional vertical business unit perspective. Fifth, we will work to offset 40% to 60% of the impact of Dodd-Frank. We believe we've offset 20% already. And sixth, maintain a fortress balance sheet with continuing excellent credit quality and strong capital levels.","We know that if we execute on our intermediate-term goals, we will on our own, without M&A or interest rate improvement, reach our 55% efficiency ratio goal in mid-2013; and our 125 basis point return on average asset goal in 2014. We believe that there will be significant regulatory undertakings for all institutions in 2012 and later years as the numerous regulations are enacted under Dodd-Frank.","As we've said in the past, this is a significant tax on the industry, and we'll inevitably contribute to the fatigue factor, particularly among smaller players, specially in light of the additional lost revenue and the higher compliance costs related to Dodd-Frank. We know we can hit our financial goals on our own through organic growth, dividends and share repurchases, but we'll also be working diligently to get there faster via industry consolidation. Global deleveraging and the rising level of fatigue within the U.S. banking industry would provide acquisition opportunities in 2012 and 2013.","With that, I'll pass it to Kirk to discuss the quarter and the expense management initiatives in more detail. Kirk?","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you. On Slide 4, we provide an overview of our fourth quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $58.7 million, or $0.17 per share; with a net income of $43 million, or $0.12 per share. The net interest margin improved to 4.16% compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. The improvement in the reported level is the result of cost recovery income resulting from better-than-expected performance on certain acquired loans in the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. ","Operating net interest margin, excluding cost recovery income, was 4.07% for the quarter compared to 4.11% in the third quarter. Total loan growth including runoffs in the acquired portfolios amounted to 5% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 50 basis points in the quarter. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 62.7% from 63.1% in the third quarter. ","Capital ratios remain strong. We continue to deploy capital through organic growth. The tangible equity ratio stands at 12% as of fourth quarter 2011.","On Slide 5, we discuss recent revenue growth initiatives. We continue to focus on commercial lending growth given our strength throughout the financial crisis, our larger balance sheet, broad operational capabilities and our expansion into new markets. Our goal is to leverage our expanded footprint in both the Boston MSA and Long Island in order to build upon renewed commercial, residential mortgage and Home Equity momentum and drive asset-based lending.","Another key to revenue growth will be the ability to leverage our broad fee income product set, which includes cash management, asset management, brokerage, insurance, merchant and payroll services. We are also actively redesigning our incentive plans to objectively reward cross-selling within and across division lines.","On Slide 6, we move to an overview of recent expense initiatives. You'll see a clear emphasis on cost reduction. As we mentioned in October, we successfully completed the Danvers core system conversion in the fourth quarter, our fourth successful Core System conversion in 2011 and our sixth over the past 2 years. ","During the fourth quarter, we further rightsized our employee base following the 4 acquisitions we closed in 2010 and the Danvers transaction in 2011. The combined actions announced in the third and fourth quarter will result in compensation savings of $13 million in 2012, and over $15 million annualized as some of that savings will come later in the year.","We continue to realign our branch network following the acquisitions of Butler, RiverBank, Smithtown and Danvers and the de novo success we've enjoyed in Westchester and Boston. We expect to consolidate approximately 15 branches during 2012, which will result in $4 million of operating expense savings and approximately $5 million annualized. But again, some of that savings coming later in the year.","We are also actively working on real estate consolidation efforts to best utilize existing office space across the franchise. Further, we've identified IT contractor and other consultant savings of approximately $3 million in 2012. ","Lastly, we've identified another approximately $9 million of annual cost savings throughout the franchise. We strongly believe that these savings will not impede revenue growth.","Everyone at People's United is focused on continued steady progress as we move forward with a constant goal of increasing our recurring operating income. ","On Slide 7, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.16% margin results for the quarter. As you'll recall, third quarter net interest margin was 4.11%. The effects of lower loan yields reduced the margin by 10 basis points. We picked up 9 basis points in the Bank of Smithtown cost recovery income and experienced the benefit of 6 basis points as a result of lower deposit rates and the fourth quarter benefit from the payoff of acquired FHLB advances, which occurred late in the third quarter.","On Slide 8, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined slightly in the quarter as a result of a continued environment of low interest rates and pricing pressure in the market. The differences between reported margin and operating margin this quarter is due to the 9 basis points of cost recovery income associated with certain Bank of Smithtown acquired loans. ","Our strong margin is the product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means we do not need to stretch our credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years.","Let me provide you a little more detail on the next Slide. Slide 9 links closely with our discussion in the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans total approximately $68 million, and the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.6 billion. ","As a reminder, the carrying amount of acquired loans is based on expected cash flows and reflects an inherent discount attributable to both the accretable yield and the nonaccretable difference. These expected cash flows are regularly reassessed as they were in this quarter for the Bank of Smithtown portfolio. ","Generally speaking, expected cash flows are impacted by the following: changes in expected P&I payments over the estimated life of the loan, which may be attributable to the changes in our credit outlook or a result of loan modifications; changes in prepayment assumptions, which may change the amount of interest expected to be collected; and changes in interest rate indices for variable rate loans as expected cash flows are based on the rates and effect of the time and the cash flow reassessment.","As a result, the portfolio's accretable yield and nonaccretable difference are subject to change throughout the life of the portfolio as the estimate of expected cash flows is updated. These changes may be favorable or unfavorable. Such variability can increase when there's a significant level of loan sale, settlement and payoff activity, as has been the case with the Smithtown portfolio. We'll provide some further color on the Smithtown reassessment on Slide 10.","Before we do that, as you can see in the table, the carrying amount in the acquired loan portfolio at December 31, 2011, reflects $1.3 billion in accretable yield and nearly $250 million in nonaccretable difference, which compares favorably to a level of acquired NPLs at that same date.","The Smithtown portfolio is initially set up for accounting purposes as 6 loan pools, which are aggregated based on common risk characteristics and 147 individual loans. The loans accounted for individually, which had an initial carrying amount of $131 million, represented construction and CRE loans in nonperforming status as of the acquisition date. These loans were at various stages of project completion at uncertain prospects for effective loan resolution and, as a result, possessed unique risk and credit quality considerations. ","During the quarter, we reassessed the cash flows in the Smithtown portfolio and noted the following results: the 6 loan pools, each of which is accounted for as a single asset, have generally performed within our initial range of expectations established at the acquisition date; loans accounted for individually resulted in the recognition of $5 million of cost recovery income associated with specific credits that have experienced better-than-expected cash flows; and $7.4 million of impairments associated with specific credits that have experienced worse-than-expected cash flow. The cost recovery income has reflected net interest income and accounts for the incremental 9 basis points in the margin referred to earlier. The impairment charge is reflected in our loan loss provision and serves to establish an allowance for loan losses on the underlying loans.","Not surprisingly, these loans accounted for individually represent the population of loans subject to our more aggressive loan workout efforts during the past year. As a result of those efforts, as of December 31, 2011, the population of loans accounted for individually total approximately 70, and represented a carrying amount of less than $40 million. As such, we believe the level of specific -- of loan-specific risk inherent in this population of loans has been greatly reduced. ","For the full year, the impact on earnings stemming from activity within the Smithtown portfolio, exclusive of normal interest accretion, was a $5.1 million benefit. This benefit is comprised of $5 million of cost recovery income and a $7.5 million net gain on sale of acquired loans, partially offset by $7.4 million of impairment. Accordingly, we continue to believe that the challenges inherent in this portfolio are manageable.","Slide 11 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in the gross loans. The loan portfolios produced total loan growth of 5% quarter-over-quarter annualized or 15.3% quarter-over-quarter annualized of originated loan growth. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of originated loan growth greater than 10%, which reflects a strong momentum within the franchise. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining the outstanding customer service standards of a small bank. Importantly, our customers and others within the market recognize that we did not pull back in the last economic crisis and supported them over the last few years. So much of the growth is word-of-mouth referrals from our long-term customers.","Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $620 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. We continue to expand into new markets via new products. Commercial real estate contributed 39% or $182 million. The portfolio remains very broadly diversified with most relationships well below $25 million. ","C&I contributed 37% or $172 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses: PCLC, our equipment finance business, grew $69 million in the quarter; and People's United equipment finance increased $47 million. Residential mortgage added 36% or $168 million. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 95% were hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. 60% of the pipeline is Jumbo Product. Fourth quarter '11 originations, average loan size was 616,000. The average FICO score for 4Q '11 originations was 757 with an average LTV of 68%.","Also within the retail category, new Home Equity commitment closings totaled $150 million compared to $179 million in the third quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average loan or line size of the fourth quarter originations was 125,000. The average FICO scores for the fourth quarter was 757, with an average combined loan-to-value of 54%. 100% of our Home Equity loans are retail originated.","You'll notice those numbers didn't add to 100%. That's because our consumer segment shrank by $17.6 million, almost entirely the result of expected runoff in indirect auto loan business, which we exited in the third quarter. As a reminder, our consumer loan segment is 92% Home Equity loans, which were essentially flat in the quarter, growing by 800,000.","You can see on Slide 12 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. This is the first time we've broken the deposit business out this way, but we feel it better reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here. ","Our consumer deposit base grew $98 million while the commercial base increased $231 million. This growth occurred while overall deposit cost fell by 6 basis points to 50 basis points. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand in savings or money market deposits within the acquired institutions. As of December 31, 2011, commercial deposits represented 25% of our deposit base. We expect commercial deposits to grow more than 10% this year, bolstered by 2 large initiatives that are underway, which we expect will result in over $300 million of deposit recapture and products that were previously externally managed. ","In addition, incentive-based compensation is expected to further foster commercial deposit growth. By way of update, our Westchester franchise totaled 6 branches, grew by $43 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $522 million as of year end. Our 5 de novo branches in the Boston market grew by $38 million in the quarter and total deposits stand at $124 million as of year end. Not bad for 12 months.","Most importantly, annualized deposit growth was a bit more than loan growth. As you have heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings.","Slide 13 is an important lens for us to think about the growth as it occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase fee income and continue to reduce cost, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 18% and 14%, respectively.","Slide 14 provides a breakdown of noninterest income. Our noninterest income declined by $13 million quarter-over-quarter. The largest quarter-over-quarter changes were reduced income from third quarter security gains of $8.6 million and a $5 million decline in interchange fees as a result of the first full quarter of the Durbin Amendment. First quarter and third quarter are the seasonally stronger periods for insurance as we have discussed previously. ","Additionally, we experienced a $2.7 million reduction in prepayments fees, which we noted in last quarter's commentary are difficult to predict. Last quarter, we recognized $4.8 million of losses in acquired loan sales compared to a loss of just $400,000 in the fourth quarter.","On Slide 15, you can see that our noninterest expense numbers, as well as operating expenses, were essentially flat. We had nonoperating expenses of $23 million in the quarter. The largest components of nonoperating expense this quarter were $13.3 million of merger-related expenses associated with the Danvers conversion, which occurred on October 17, followed by $4.8 million of charges associated with the planned consolidation of selected branches and other office space. General severance and other termination-related costs totaled $4.9 million.","As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the recurring noninterest expense base and believe that when we normalize for items that we feel are nonrecurring but weren't called out as nonoperating, our run rate expense base approximates $205 million. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down, such as our targeted full year operating expense base should be in the range we previously discussed.","On Slide 16, the efficiency ratio decreased to 62.7% for the fourth quarter compared to 63.1% in the third quarter. As we mentioned, we remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency ratio run rate goal in mid-2013.","Slides 17 and 18 are a quick reminder of our excellent credit quality. Nonperforming assets at 2% of originated loans and REO remain well below our peer group and Top 50 banks. NPAs increased from $305 million to $337 million, a $32 million increase. Two relationships accounted for $25 million of this increase. We seem to hover in the 1.75% to 2% range since the level of NPAs are so low that 1 or 2 loans will move us up or down in that range.","Looking at Slide 18, net charge-offs remained essentially flat at 29 basis points, approximately 30% of our peers. This is not a new trend and reflects a minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets.","On Slide 19, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items to note: Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is approximately 1.4% with a coverage ratio of 77% of commercial NPLs. The allowance for loan losses on retail loans increased slightly this quarter. As you all know, we have strict loan loss allowance methodology which is consistently applied. Mix shift to new originations explained the modest decline in the overall coverage ratio from the prior quarter. ","After excluding the $7.4 million increase in the provision, which related to the impairment on  uncertain Bank of Smithtown loans, the provision was down slightly for the third quarter 2011.","Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 20, you can see our operating return on average assets for the fourth quarter was 86 basis points. As we've outlined, the primary reasons for the decline are reduced noninterest-related income and a larger average balance sheet. Clearly, the low rate environment is limiting the positive effect of our organic growth. In addition, regulatory reform is negatively impacting our fee income. However, we're making progress in offsetting lost fee income resulting from regulatory reform, and expect to make up a majority of the negative impact of financial reform during 2012 by accelerating growth of other fee income products. As we've outlined, we're undertaking a number of initiatives to rightsize our cost base, and believe we will reach our 125 basis point return on average asset target in 2014 assuming the current interest rate and economic environment.","On Slide 21, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 425 basis points above peers, which produces below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11% return on average tangible equity.","On Slide 22, consistent with the outline of some of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio trend lower through 2012.","On Slide 23, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 12% and our Tier 1 common ratio at 14.3%, which compares well to our peers at 7.7% and 11% as of the third quarter, respectively.","Slide 24 summarizes -- 2011 illustrates the power of our sustainable competitive advantage. Despite the low growth, low rate environment and increased regulatory headwinds, we delivered return on average asset improvement that is likely to be in the top quartile of our peers. It is our outstanding people and platform and the related momentum, which positions us so well for the quarters and years ahead. ","This concludes our presentation. Now we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Kirk, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the increase in the securities portfolio. I just saw balances went up quarter-over-quarter.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, they did. During the quarter, we did put on a little over $500 million in some relatively short CMOs. With the expectation of rates continuing to be down here in the near future, we chose to put a little bit of money to work. But these are short CMOs, average life, of around 2 years based off of a 10-year paper.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. What kind of yields are we getting on that?","Kirk W. Walters","They were around 1.25 to 1.30, somewhere in that range.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can we expect you to employ the same strategy in the upcoming quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","I don't expect that we will see the securities portfolio move up much from here. We're fortunate to have had, and continue to have, good prospects for strong loan growth. And depending on deposit growth, we expect some of that cash may get put to work in our -- funding some of our loans.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to the margin, if we exclude the 9 basis point impact starting off at about 4.07% level, can you give a little outlook for what you're expecting this coming quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","We haven't given any outlook quarter by quarter. What we have given is an outlook that we expected, which we gave last quarter and reaffirming this quarter, that we expect that we will remain above 4% or close to 4% through the first half of the year, and then we'll dip slightly below that as we get into the second half of the year.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, did you buy back any stock this quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","In terms of the quarter itself, we did not buy back any stock.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what are your thoughts on reengaging in the buyback on the coming quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, the -- we never really say when we are in buying stock or not in buying stock. As you know, we have an existing authorization out there for a 5% stock buyback. We were quite active in the third quarter in terms of buying in shares. And so it's an evaluation of various levers that we pull as we go forward. It was certainly one we utilized in the third quarter. And as I mentioned, we have an existing authorization out there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just in terms of the loan growth, Kirk, you just said that the prospects were strong in loan growth. And Jack, you had sort of referenced mid-single to low double-digit loans. Can you just talk about where you're seeing that growth and kind of drill down a little bit more into the specifics of that in terms of loan size and just kind of where you see the opportunities there?","John P. Barnes","Well, we really -- at this point, we've been seeing the loan growth in a very balanced way. I think we described the various growth rates in C&I, commercial real estate, and in the residential areas in particular. And as you drill into those activities, whether it's by business line or geography, we're really making some steady headway on all fronts, which we're very pleased with. I would say in terms of your piece of your question about loan size, again, very consistent with our history. We are very active in the middle-market lending but also have a strong business banking, small business lending program, which is also very active. And we've actually been putting a lot of effort into strengthening that program. Very promising pace in the Boston area, very nice progress in Maine. We've taken on some new personnel there that have done a great job for us. And some steady progress, less pace but steady progress as we get familiar with Long Island and that new market as well. So pretty nice balance across the front.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just on the initiative that you guys have on the fee side to help to offset the Durbin pressure. I know, Jack, you said you'd expect that kind of to come through to 2012. Will we see the effects of that starting as soon as the second quarter?","John P. Barnes","Yes. We would like to think that you absolutely will. I think there are some things kind of in motion. We mentioned there that we think we've offset 20% already, and some of that, I think, depends on basic activity in accounts. And we are growing our -- the number of our accounts. And aside of that, then, we're really strongly pushing a cross-sell effort, both kind of management effort, employee direction and incentive program comp modification, to get everybody very focused in making progress across all of our fee businesses. We've demonstrated nicely throughout the last year, but these things, once you get momentum, it makes a great deal of difference in people's confidence. And we've landed some nice business that is beginning to show that the emphasis is paying off. And that's where we get our projection, if you will.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's great. And then just finally, on the M&A comment. Maybe could you just run through what type of institution would be an appropriate target for you guys? Or what you'd be looking for as it relates to supplementing the growth with M&A?","John P. Barnes","Well, I mean, I think we've historically said we -- I think everybody's familiar with our comments about our market and expanding within our geography and adjacent to our geography, so I would start there. We remain focused in that manner. We have historically expressed and continue to feel strongly that commercially oriented banks are a nice match for us, but we do not exclude thrifts by any measure, and just a different type of undertaking. And we want to be opportunistic where we continue to be open to the idea that it may be a large transaction that is now in front of us, and we'll be opportunistic in terms of responding to that kind of opportunity, or it may be a smaller transaction that we think is a good strategic fit in that broader outline I just gave you. And we're certainly continuing to feel that those -- the acquisitions we've undertaken have been very beneficial, and the future ones can be as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Obviously, I heard the answer that you did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter. But I guess my first question is why? Is it -- I mean, was the stock price too high? I mean, are you saving it for M&A? What kind -- what was the thought process for not buying back stock?","Kirk W. Walters","Ken, we never have commented in detail on the specifics of what we go into when we're buying stock or not. We have been clear that it is one of the levers that we expect on a -- to pull on a go-forward basis, that we were very active in the third quarter and that we have an existing authorization out there and expect it to be one of the activities that we'll continue to do as we go forward in managing our capital.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right. I guess I was just hoping to share the rationale, not whether or not you're buying, but that's fine. The other question, Kirk, when you recently came into the bank not so long ago, you identified a lot of expense-saving opportunities. And I do see the improvement in the efficiency ratio over the last several quarters. But is there -- can you just comment about over -- or since you joined, do you still see the same magnitude of expense saves, more or less? And kind of where should we be thinking about the expense ratio over, say, the next 12 months?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think we gave quite a lot of detail in my commentary in terms of the expense initiatives that we embarked on this quarter. As you know, we've been, I think, pretty good at giving you some detail every quarter about where we're heading. Obviously, we now have a stated goal, as Jack mentioned, getting the overall expense level down to a total between $790 million and $810 million. If you think about where our run rate was in the third quarter, which included a full quarter of Danvers, it was about $210 million or it would've been $840 million for the year. So coming down within that run rate, it was a pretty significant reduction while still growing many, many revenue lines and not impacting the revenue growth. So we are doing what we outlined earlier, which is we're very carefully and thoughtfully managing the expense base down with the goal of getting to a 55% efficiency ratio by mid-2013.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just talking about the margin, if you look at the $68 million of accretion, you back out the $3.6 million of total carrying costs. I mean, the acquired assets are adding roughly 60 basis points to the margin. As we track towards that 125 basis point ROA target, how will that benefit decline over time? I mean, is it more gradual and linear? Or will it be lumpy along the way? How should we be thinking about the decline in that benefit from the acquired assets on your margin?","Kirk W. Walters","The way that we have described that in the past and I think is the same, and we have as you look at sort of what we would refer to as a normalized or margin originated assets and liabilities we have. But that has tended to hover around at 360. So your 60 is close, probably a little less than that, but is close. And that's if you took out all the acquired loans and deposits as if we did no acquisitions. And if you think about the $1.3 billion in accretion that we have to bring in overtime, we don't give an actual estimated life for that, but we do give you what we brought in this quarter. And so that you can make the assumptions with the other information. I think what's important to consider is if you look at the entities we've acquired, with the exception of Fin Fed, they are largely banks that have assets that you're quite familiar with in terms of life. And I think the long and short of it is that we know we may not have the accretion forever, but it's not going away that quickly either.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. One quick one, were you restricted at all during the quarter on your ability to buy back shares?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, as other questions came in, we don't comment on why, or why we don't buy back shares during the quarter. We were very active in the third quarter. We have an outstanding authorization out there, and we intend for it to be one of the levers that we'll utilize and manage in the capital as we proceed forward.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then last question. Could you just talk about just kind of your view of the M&A market? What you've been seeing and hearing for discussions just over the last quarter versus what you were seeing come across your desk, and what bankers were showing you over the summer and early fall and your outlook for transactions based on this and that activity. Not for you in particular, but just for the market in general.","John P. Barnes","So this is Jack. I think I would characterize that, that I would say the level of relationship building that we have been doing has been pretty consistent and active through the time period. So our behavior, if you will, has been steady and consistent. The level of opportunities that seem to be discussed in the market does seem to be ticking up a little bit. We -- when we discuss it, we think that the fatigue factor that we reference in our comments is showing up, intensifying. Because of the headwinds that we're talking about, it certainly is a difficult environment to operate in. If you don't have new opportunities, new markets, new businesses that you're working, it can get very challenging. So I would say the pace, if you will, and the level of activity is more active.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim Partners.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","The $840 million that you referenced for the cost base with Danvers, is that including the originally expected cost saves? And the $800 million that you're talking about now for the expense base, is that above and beyond the original assumptions?","Kirk W. Walters","The number that we gave was what we incurred in the third quarter, which was roughly $210 million in terms of where that run rate was at that point. In terms of our overall operating expenses, that included some level of Danvers expenses. And we've taken out some more as we went into the fourth quarter. And then, there'll be a little bit more that we'll see come through in the first quarter.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are you getting more than you originally anticipated?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes, I think we're getting a bit more in Danvers than what we originally thought we would. And probably the other note just to think about when you think about the number we reported this quarter, the $207 million, we did indicate that we thought the run rate was closer to $205 million for the quarter, and the primary difference was the impact of what we had to pay on the Visa litigation.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then looking at the decline in the carrying amount and the remaining nonaccretable difference from the third quarter to this quarter for Smithtown, any additional color there? And did you see greater than expected paydowns in that portfolio?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. We went through the reassessment of the Bank of Smithtown, and obviously on these acquired portfolios we do it at least annually. And the major items that impacted that was the individually accounted for loans. I think I gave in my commentary a fair amount of detail that within Bank of Smithtown we had 6 pools, but we had 147 individually accounted for loans that totaled a balance of $131 million. And as we went through the reassessment and such, those loans have now been either sold, settled, paid off, et cetera, and are down to under $40 million. So we had a pretty significant reduction in that, which did impact the overall levels of accretable and nonaccretable discount.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And those -- that $131 million was all in the fourth quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","No. The $131 million occurred over the year, but the reassessment was in the -- I mean the $131 million was the beginning number for the individually accounted for loans. It's down to $40 million by the end of the year. That drop of $91 million occurred throughout the year, and the reassessment was done in the fourth quarter. So as you saw throughout the year, we recorded some gains in sales of loans in the first and second quarter, recorded some losses in sales of loans. We had a number of pieces of activity going in different directions.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill + Partners.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","It looks like from the average balance sheet, the commercial real estate yields rose by 16 basis points in the quarter. Was that a function of the Smithtown recovery?","Kirk W. Walters","It was, it was. That's where the bulk of the cost recovery income that we described on loans that got settled for more than we thought, that's where that went through.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just to follow up on a comment that Jack made earlier about the dividend payout. I know that you said in your prepared remarks that the payout ratio should come down in coming quarters, but it's still fairly high. Do you worry that the regulators could force you to cut that? And what gives you confidence that they won't?","John P. Barnes","Well, we think, and hopefully you folks can see, that with our momentum, we believe that, that will continue and that the ratio will come down. As I think I've said in the past on these calls, I think I'm going to speak for our regulators. We continue to communicate with our regulators on a very regular basis, and we're very pleased with that communication. But the last thing we'll do is predict positions regulators would take now or in the future.","Mark T. Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly on the acquisition, just to follow up on earlier questions. Are you finding that seller expectations are starting to become more rational? And you've obviously done a bunch of deals recently, both clean institutions and troubled institutions. Which ones have worked generally better, would you say, for people?","John P. Barnes","Well, I think on the last part, it's a great example that -- I think that we feel great about the clean ones, if you will, but also very good about Long Island and the way we're working through the Bank of Smithtown. I think the pace that Kirk described and working through the original problems is telling of our execution there. And for a good price, we got a very nice deposit franchise that we're working very effectively. The folks on the ground in Long Island have growing deposits. They're responding extremely well to training. And we're starting to produce both commercial and consumer loans. So each is different, and we think it's really a matter of doing the business assessment and then executing on the plan, much more than whether it's a troubled bank or not.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Turner with Compass Point.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the increase in NPLs quarter-over-quarter? I mean, it doesn't seem to be on a dollar basis, huge, but it does seem kind of broad based.","John P. Barnes","Actually, when you look at the increase quarter-over-quarter on the NPLs, it was in our commercial portfolios. If you look at that, I think I noted in my commentary that of the increase of a little over $30 million, $25 million related to 2 credits. They were credits that we've been watching, working closely with, did in fact go to nonaccrual. But I think we are, at this point, operating with such a relatively low level of NPAs that we see this bumping around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. You might recollect in the second quarter that little bump up with one particular credit and it came down in the third. We sort of bumped up here. And probably underlying all of this is that we have a high level of comfort with our portfolios and knowing what credits we should be concerned about and are very concerned about, and neither of these were a surprise to us.","Michael Turner - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And then also on your residential mortgage portfolio growth. Can you maybe break up the types of loans or categorize what your balance sheeting is? Is there maybe a large...","John P. Barnes","Sure. And that's just something that we -- I highlighted in my commentary as well. But 95% of what we booked were hybrid loans, 3\/1s, 5\/1s, 7\/1s and 10\/1s. Average loan size is about 616,000 in terms of what is booked into the portfolio, and certainly with very high FICOs and excellent LTVs.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mac Hodgson with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Michael Young","This is Michael Young in for Mac. I just had a couple of quick questions, one question on NIM and one on the Dodd-Frank impact. On the NIM, we see a 4-point kind of core, if you will, compression this quarter. And I was just curious, obviously, if that trend holds for the next 2 quarters, you'd stay roughly above 4. But then going forward beyond that, would you expect that trend to sort of continue? Or will you run out of kind of the funding mix weather?","John P. Barnes","I think as we have given the guidance before, we expected to stay above or around 4 up through the first 6 months and then come slightly under in the latter part of the year. One of the factors that's important in that is that about 20% of our deposits are from acquired institutions. And the cost of those deposits is still a little over 1%. So as we continue to ratchet those down, as well as our other deposits and some of the deposit initiatives that we mentioned in my commentary in the commercial arena that's coming in at rates lower than our overall cost of funds, I think we still have opportunities. It gets harder, without a doubt, and that's one of the reasons that we're saying that we may not be able to keep up, but we're working real hard to minimize it.","Michael Young","Okay. And then also just had one clarification. The $5 million of reduced interest income this quarter from Dodd-Frank, did that include the 20% offset? Or was that x the 20% offset? Will the 20% offset, in effect, be seen in 1Q?","John P. Barnes","So if I heard you right, it did not include the 20% offset. So it was a $5 million drop in the interchange fees related to our portfolio. We have made other changes, so the 20% refers to other changes we've made in a variety of ways within our bank service charges to offset that anticipated $5 million.","Kirk W. Walters","And the $5 million is very consistent with our forecast of $20 million for the year, so...","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So just to clarify, so the Dodd-Frank impact is interchanged only, correct? It's not Reg E or anything?","John P. Barnes","So the $5 million reference is Durbin related. There are other impacts in Dodd-Frank, so as we're referring to the headwinds and the challenges, things like Reg E are included. I think, seems like going through last year, we described kind of how that gradually came through. But it is a variety of -- if you will, identified as well as -- in terms of -- when we talk about headwinds with Dodd-Frank, we're naturally also talking about anticipated impacts on the expense levels that will come from new regulations, some of which we're not totally clear on how it will impact us yet. But we are ramping up capacity to deal with things like that, for instance, in compliance and other areas, if that's helpful to put perspective on it.","Kirk W. Walters","Casey, it's Kirk. Just to be clear. The $5 million you're referring to is just the interchange piece. But as Jack is indicating, embedded throughout other pieces of our fee income and such, we obviously have impacts greater than that from Reg E and different aspects of the Dodd-Frank bill.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right. And I guess that's what I'm -- those identifiable -- that's the number I'm looking for that you're hoping to recapture, 50% up.","Kirk W. Walters","I see, no, our reference of recapturing 40% to 60% was just in relation to the interchange.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. All right. So just to follow up. So I mean, assuming all goes well, I appreciate the clarity on the cost cuts, this will definitely put you closer to that 55% goal. That said, it is a little bit short. Do you guys expect, I mean, is the plan to let this run out and then hopefully get some M&A? And if you don't, is it possible to get there without M&A, I guess is my question, by the middle of 2013?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I think we've been pretty clear in our discussions that we, to get that 55% efficiency ratio, we're not betting on M&A or interest rate moves, et cetera. So this is, what we have done, is every quarter we continue to report the new actions we've taken. I think this is another quarter with all the detail that I just gave you of a number of cost initiatives, all of which largely been enacted, or we know exactly when they're going to be enacted, which will continue to move us down closer to that 55% goal. And our expectation to get there is to continue to work very hard at maintaining and growing revenue and, at the same point, continue to crank down costs.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you for joining us today.

My name is Patrick, and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Incorporated. Please proceed, sir. ","Peter Goulding","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes; Kirk Walters; David Rosato; and Jeff Hoyt are here with me to review our second quarter results. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today. Consistent with past earnings discussions, I\u2019d like to begin by sharing my views of our current strategic positioning. We continue to focus on building this franchise for the long term, driving revenue growth while tightly managing expenses. To accomplish this, our seasoned bankers are leveraging People's United well regarded brand to form new relationships and deepen existing relationship. ","This quarter\u2019s results reflect the benefits of investments we continue to make in people, products and services, as well as our expanded geographic footprint. We also continue to evaluate the best ways to serve our customers and grow our businesses, as evidenced by the recently announced Merchant Services joint venture. In that case, Vantiv will bring their substantial payment processing infrastructure and history of payment of payment processing innovation to help us better serve our customers. Further, we are pleased with our ability to control operating expenses, especially given the number of strategic investments we have made and the increasing cost of regulatory compliance. ","Now I would like to discuss our second quarter results. On Slide 2, operating earnings were $59.9 million or $0.20 per share while net income was $72.3 million or $0.24 per share. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis increased to $232.8 million, which represents 2% annualized growth during the quarter. The net interest margin declined by 4 basis points to 3.13% compared to 3.17% in the first quarter of 2014. ","End of period loans grew at a 13% annualized rate in the second quarter. This marks our 15th consecutive quarter of loan growth and is a testament to both our relationship managers and our customers. Our growth is founded on customer relationships which have expanded as we have added talent, product capabilities and deepened our presence in the large markets of Metro New York and Greater Boston. Further, our commercial pipelines remain strong and runoff in the acquired portfolios continues to occur at a slower rate as we predicted in January. ","Total deposits grew at a 7% annualized rate which was largely attributable to a $665 million increase in broker deposits. As we have noted in the past, our municipal business tends to be seasonally lower in the second quarter as fiscal year end activity negatively impacts deposit balances. The actual business fundamentals within this customer base remains strong. This decline is merely a timing issue. We continue to emphasize deposit gathering consistent with our long held preference for relationship based banking on both sides of the balance sheet. ","Non-interest income, excluding the $20.6 million gain from the Merchant Services joint venture, was in line with the first quarter at $79.5 million. We will discuss the Merchant Services joint venture further in the coming slides. ","Operating expenses decreased $4.8 million to $206.7 million as a result of disciplined expense control. The efficiency ratio for the quarter improved to 61.8% from 63.9% in the first quarter of 2014, primarily due to both revenue expansion and careful expense management. As we continue to grow both in that interest income and fee income while controlling expenses, we anticipate efficiency ratio progress in the quarters ahead. ","Asset quality remains strong with net charge offs of 10 basis points and non-performers at 96 basis points, the lowest levels we have experienced in six years and well below the industry medium. As mentioned before, we firmly believe that sound underwriting is the only way to confidently grow the balance sheet. ","Capital ratios remain strong, especially in light of our relatively low risk business model. During the second quarter we strengthened total risk based capital levels via a $400 million issuance of 10 year bank level subordinated notes. ","With that I\u2019ll pass it to Kirk and David to discuss the quarter in more detail, first Kirk.","Kirk Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 3 we provide detail behind the linked quarter change and net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis. Runoff in the acquired loans portfolio resulted in declines and accretion of $1.6 million. Lower average balances in the securities portfolio relative to the first quarter negatively impacted net interest income by $1 million. This was offset by strong originative loan growth and one more calendar day in the second quarter which positively impact net interest income by $1.8 million and $1.7 million respectively. As we have mentioned before, growth in net interest income from the originative portfolio outpacing loss accretion on the acquired portfolio, is a positive sign for the quarters ahead. ","On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our quarterly net interest margin results. New loan volume negatively impacted the margin by seven basis points as new business yields remained lower than the total loan portfolio yield. Lower average securities balances pressured the margin by one basis point. An additional calendar day in the quarter and improved loan mix positively impacted the margin by three basis points and one basis point respectively. ","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss our recent loan and deposit activity.","David Rosato ","Thank you, Kirk. Slide 5 provides a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. The loan portfolio grew $826 million or 13% annualized. This was achieved through leveraging our expanded footprint as well as progress in our heritage markets and strengthened product lineup. Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $959 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products and geographic areas. Commercial real estate contributed $264 million of the total originated loan growth, while C&I contributed $617 million. Within C&I, we saw strength across many categories, including traditional C&I, People\u2019s United Equipment finance and mortgage warehouse lending. The commercial portfolio remains broadly diversified with respect to loan type, geography and industry. ","Residential mortgages contributed $58 million of originated loan growth in the second quarter. Approximately 91% of the residential mortgage originations added to the portfolio were hybrid-adjustable rate mortgages. The consumer portfolio contributed $20 million to originated loan growth, which was driven by higher home equity advances in the second quarter. It is important to note that 100% of home equity loans are retail originated with approximately 65% of second quarter originations in a first lien position, which is slightly above the range we have experienced over the past three years. ","We experienced acquired loan runoff of $133 million this quarter compared to $114 million in the first quarter and $201 million in the second quarter of 2013. We anticipate runoff in all of our loan portfolios, including our acquired loan portfolio, to remain at low levels. Slower runoff is expected to contribute to continued healthy loan growth.","You can see on Slide 6 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. Total deposits increased $423 million supported by broker deposit growth of $665 million, of which approximately 80% were money market deposits. More importantly, we experienced annualized organic non-interest bearing and savings deposit growth of 13% and 4% respectively. We also experienced a 14% annualized decline in organic time deposits, which combined with strong organic demand deposit growth, will help improve deposit costs going forward. As referenced earlier, the seasonality in our municipal business had a negative $180 million impact on commercial deposits in the second quarter, and accounted for the majority of the decline in organic deposits. ","We believe we\u2019re underway commercial deposits and continue to make changes to further emphasize deposit gathering. This quarter, we saw an improvement in commercial deposit mix, with commercial non-interest bearing deposits increasing $203 million to $3.2 billion. We firmly believe that deposits are an important part of the customer relationship, and our ongoing focus remains on growing organic deposits and improving the deposit mix. ","Now, I'll pass it back to Kirk. ","Kirk Walters","Thank you, David. On slide 7, we take a closer look at non-interest income, which excluding the Margin Services joint venture gain, remained in line with the first quarter. Bank service charges increased $2.3 million, which was mostly driven by higher cash management and commercial services fees. Investment management fees and customer interest rate swap income each added $800,000 to fee income this quarter. Operating lease income declined $1.4 million due to higher levels of payoffs, while commercial bank and lending fees also fell $1.4 million. ","Insurance income decline $900,000 due to the seasonal nature of insurance renewals, which typically take place in the first and third quarters. Gain on residential mortgage sales declined $800,000. Lastly is we\u2019re spending some time discussing the recently formed Merchant Services joint venture, which positively impacted non-interest income by $20.6 million. The new venture, People\u2019s United Merchant Services, will offer customers a comprehensive suite of payment solutions by combining People\u2019s United\u2019s strong reputation and broad access to commercial merchants with Vantiv\u2019s deep payment expertise, innovative products, security tools and processing scale. To establish a solid foundation for the joint venture\u2019s success, both companies have contributed merchant accounts to the new entity, including the entire People\u2019s United merchant portfolio. People\u2019s United retained a 49% minority interest in the venture. ","On Slide 8, we illustrate the keys components of our changes in non-interest expense. As we have mentioned before, we continue to control expense tightly while investing in revenue producing initiatives and covering the higher cost of compliance. Non-operating expenses decreased $3.6 million, which is mainly attributable to branch closure accruals and higher severance related expenses that occurred in the first quarter. From an operating expense perspective, operating lease expenses decreased $2.4 million, which is partially attributable to accelerated depreciation on a single a relationship in the first quarter. Comp and benefits decreased $1.8 million due primarily to lower payroll and benefit related cost in the second quarter. Occupancy and equipment costs decreased $1.4 million, mainly as a result of higher weather related charges in the first quarter. The net impact was a $4.8 million decrease in operating expenses for the quarter.","The next slide details our efficiency ratio over the last five quarters. As mentioned earlier, the efficiency ratio improved this quarter as a result of disciplined expense management and revenue expansion. We continue to remain very focused on improving operating leverage. ","Slides 10 and 11 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. Once again we did see an improvement in non-performing assets this quarter from already industry leading levels. Originated nonperforming assets as a percentage of originated loans in REO at 96 basis points remains well below our peer group and 50 banks and are down approximately 30% from 1.33% in the second quarter of 2013. Acquired nonperforming loans are not included in these calculations due to the different accounting model applicable to such loans. However, it is worth noting that we are very pleased with their performances. We have seen these balances decline $41 million or 26% to $118 million in the current quarter from $159 million a year ago. ","Looking at slide 11, net charge off continues to remain low at 10 basis points compared to 12 basis points last quarter and 19 basis points one year ago. Excluding acquired loan charge offs, net charge offs this quarter were 9 basis points. These levels reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets and are well below peers. Over the last four quarters charge offs against specific reserves represent approximately 64% of total charge offs. As such we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. ","Now I pass it back to Jack. ","John Barnes ","Thank you Kirk, slide 12 highlights our ability to grow both sides of the balance sheet. We continue to make progress on the loan and deposit growth on a per share basis while maintaining excellent asset quality. Over the past year, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at a compound annual rate of 17% and 15% respectively. ","Operating return on average assets for the second quarter was 72 basis points compared to 69 basis points in the prior quarter. Our return on average assets continues to be impacted by the ultra-low interest rate environment and some recent initiatives which are still ramping up to more normal levels of productivity. Progress will be driven by continued loan and deposit growth, fee income and a continued discipline approach to expenses. ","Slide 14 illustrates the improvement in our return on average tangible equity since the second quarter of 2013. We expect to see continued progress on this metric as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. ","Now I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss our capital ratios and our interest rate risk profile. ","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. On slide 15 we see that capital levels at the holding company and the bank remained solid with our tangible common equity ratio at 7.9% and our tier 1 common at 10%. Total risk based capital increased to 12.5%, which was driven by the $400 million issuance of 10 year bank level subordinated notes. These notes were sold to yield 4.07% and simultaneously converted via an interest rate swap to a floating three month LIBOR spread of approximately 157 basis points. Additionally, these notes will save approximately $2 million in FDIC insurance costs, which affectively equates to an additional 50 basis points of savings. ","Slide 16 illustrates our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. As you can see, our asset sensitivity has increased for both parallel shock and yield curve twist scenarios from last quarter, even with the fixed-to-floating conversion of our recently issued subordinated notes. This is primarily due to projected balance sheet growth, a loan mix trending toward floating rate loans as well as a smaller securities portfolio. ","Now I\u2019ll pass it back to jack to wrap things up.","John Barnes","Thank you, David. We continue to look for ways to best serve our customers and build relationships, while maintaining tight expense control and returning capital to shareholders. Our commitment to outstanding customer service, combined with our existing and growing set of capabilities, allows us to attract and retain exceptional talent, all of which provides a sustainable competitive advantage. ","This concludes our presentation and we\u2019ll be happy to answer any question. Operator, we\u2019ll be glad to take questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good afternoon. It\u2019s actually Timur Braziler filling in for Dave. Just a couple of questions on the lending side. Excellent C&I growth this quarter and I appreciate the breakout by the segments. To be a little bit more specific, was there any particular segment that experienced the brunt of the growth or was it pretty spread out across the different segments?","John Barnes","The C&I portfolio was clearly the segment that grew the most. We made a lot of progress in Massachusetts and our management and growth in commercial line offices were certainly impacted that. We made some nice progress in Maine. We won a number of pieces of new business and that group did a great job. ABL was also part of the growth. And I don\u2019t know that that was in the script, but that was also a piece of steady growth, along with the mortgage warehouse. The equipment finance pieces also were very steady in good growth rates. ","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then I guess for the traditional type of C&I lending, was that more on the new growth side or did utilization rates improve as well? ","John Barnes","Utilization rates were actually very flat. So it was expanding relationships.","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then turning to commercial real-estate, I think I missed the number. But I think originations were somewhere in the $280 million range. Is that correct?","John Barnes","Yeah, 260ish.","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","$260, okay. And then what portion of that $260 was related to multifamily? Or I guess as you call it, New York Commercial Real-estate. ","John Barnes","It\u2019s about probably more than half, a little more than half.","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. And then we\u2019ve heard from some others that the competition seems to be picking up primarily on the commercial real estate space. Maybe just a little commentary on what you\u2019re seeing from competitive pressures. Are you seeing anything out there that\u2019s stretching it either on pricing or on credit terms?","John Barnes","Yeah. I think, and like everybody else that segment certainly has become very competitive over the last year or two. The competitive atmosphere if you will continues to be pretty intense. The property values also are impacting commercial real estate portfolios. I think that some long-term holders are selling as values increase. ","Timur Braziler \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay great. And then just lastly, if you have the total commercial loan pipeline at the end of the second quarter and how that compares to the first quarter. ","John Barnes","We don\u2019t really give out the pipelines. I think in our commentary we mentioned our pipelines remain strong and they do pretty much in line with last quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from in the line David Darst with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed. ","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","So I guess this quarter, as far as funding your loan growth, you had the benefit of the sub debt. And so that contributed to the loan to deposit ratio inching up. How are you thinking about for the remainder of the year and next year, funding deposit, funding the loan growth and managing the deposit ratio? ","John Barnes","I\u2019m going to ask David to take that. ","David Rosato","Sure. Hi David. As we said on the last call, we ended the first quarter with loan to deposit ratio of 103. And we said that, we would expect it to be slightly lower than that and trend lower over the course of the year. The second quarter tends to be a seasonally low quarter for us for deposits and the first quarter tends to be a little elevated. So we are not backing away from our thinking that we will have a lower -- gradually lower loan to deposit ratio as the second half of the year unfolds. ","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","And you\u2019re expecting \u2013 is that coming from broker deposits or are you going to try and test your own markets for some CD specials or is it core deposits?","David Rosato","It's going to be a combination of additional broker deposits as well as core deposits being defined as both commercial-retail as well as our government banking business. ","Kirk Walters","David, it's Kirk. This tends to be seasonally our lower point, not only for retail, but we always end up in the situation with municipal where in particular states right at the end of their year, they have to pay off their loans, et cetera. So you\u2019ll see in the footnotes to our slide that we indicated that we had an outflow of about $180 million in municipals right at the end of the quarter and that\u2019s a number that generally comes back in, in pretty short order in July. ","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Then what are the loan items that we need to adjust for the JV?","Kirk Walters","I'll take a crack at that. Obviously the gain that came through is a one-time gain item, and what will happen now with the JV where we have a minority interest is it will continue to flow through, the income will continue to flow through the other line which is where Merchant Services income was previously. Obviously it will come through on a net basis. So there will also be some very minor reductions down in the G&A areas. So it's going to flow through and for our practical purpose right in the other income line no different than it did before.","David Darst \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Do you anticipate that with the partnership you can accelerate the net growth and net returns for that business? ","John Barnes","We looked at certainly a long-term effort to improve what we\u2019re delivering to our client-base. And within into the market, Vantiv has the capacity to handle much larger merchants than we could necessarily attract and the experience to deal with them. They also bring a sales program that is stronger than what we were putting on the ground. So that has a lot to do with the forward looking strategy and we\u2019ll be working together with them to realize the benefits of it as we go. It will be gradual and take some time kicking in. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW. Please proceed.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Just quickly to follow up on David\u2019s question on the merchant banking. So I think unless I\u2019m looking at this wrong, it looks like you\u2019ve consolidated some of your fee lines this quarter. What was the merchant service income in the second quarter?","Kirk Walters","That is a line that we\u2019ve historically broken out, Collyn in term of (inaudible. ","David Rosato","We have previously provided that line item. We\u2019ve collapsed it this quarter in light of the venture being informed because the equity method pickup will now roll through other non-interest income as Kirk said earlier.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. So I think it was $1.1 million in the first quarter. Do you know what that was in the second quarter, or can you give it to us or?","Kirk Walters","I think it\u2019s a pretty comparable number. Sorry about that.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay. So then if we just kind of, again following on sort of the trajectory of what this joint venture will bring, the objective is just to sort of accelerate the growth based on what you said Jack with the sales effort and larger merchants and that type of thing. Is that correct?","John Barnes","That\u2019s correct. I think just a little bit more color which will hopefully help people understand, we\u2019ve been in this business a long time. We had kind of flattened out in the growth of the business. And so we went through an evaluation of kind of how do we move ourselves forward from here, including just strengthening our own sales program. We looked at the capabilities, where are we not winning business? And then we looked at all the alternatives and went through a pretty thorough process and landed on that this type of approach gave us the best possibility and prospects for growing the contribution of the business with the company. We\u2019ve got a great footprint. We have a lot of commercial relationships and it\u2019s a great product to deliver in to them. So we\u2019re expecting over time that we\u2019ll see a nice benefit from entering this relationship. ","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And just to touch back on the C&I growth that you guys put up this quarter. Linked quarter increase of about, I mean $573 million and that was \u2013 that\u2019s a huge increase. Certainly the highest you guys have seen in quite a long time. Jack, I know you gave some color as to what was driving that, but was there any one large relationship in there that drove the bulk of that? It just seems like a huge jump on a linked quarter basis.","John Barnes","No, I\u2019m sorry. What line are you looking at?","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","The C&I loans that went from --","John Barnes","Sure. Sorry I didn\u2019t hear the beginning of what you were saying. No, not at all actually. One thing I did mention which I should is we did very well in the middle market piece of our core commercial relationships as well. So it really was across the board. I think probably the only kind of net new effort was we had some nice early contribution from the team that joined us in Boston. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve been working hard with making progress and building out the team in Massachusetts, and just had some nice progress. I mentioned the two main relationship. Those were nice wins, good size customers in that market.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay and then \u2026","John Barnes","But it was in the scheme of things sorry, to get to your question Collyn, very granular.","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a long those lines, how should we think about commercial banking fees, that are kind of -- were down on a linked quarter basis, but yet you\u2019re seeing this tremendous commercial growth. Are you finding yourself having to sort of concede on certain fees to get the relationship or -- just trying to understand that dynamic.","John Barnes","Yeah, there\u2019s a lot there. So some of it is \u2013 there were lower prepayment fees in the quarter which some of the commercial loan fees, I think that line referenced and because we don\u2019t run prepayment fees through our margins. And then if you look across, we talk about our increasing capabilities and we have increased our capabilities in international service areas, in the derivative sales areas and strength in our cash management product set and we have more sales folks on the ground in the market. So we are expecting and we are getting some nice traction. The prepayment fees, that activity just happens. I think it\u2019s slowing as the number of -- so many people have refinanced over the last several years. There just aren\u2019t just that many people left in the portfolio that are going to make that decision to pay the fee and go to the lower rates. ","Collyn Gilbert \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Sure. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just one quick final question. Kirk, on the expenses, now given you\u2019ve gotten through the first quarter. You\u2019ve rationalized some of these branches. Is this $208 million a good run rate on the expense side do you think from here? ","Kirk Walters","I think when you look at the quarter on an operating basis, I think it was just a hair maybe a touch lower than that. But the -- I think we tend to run in this range of probably $205 million to $208 million and as we go into the latter part of the year, our expectation will be pretty similar to that. We do pick up an extra day in terms of day counts and that kind of thing. So there may be a little bit of uptick. But we\u2019ve I think been pretty successful over a number of quarters now to run in a pretty consistent expense level while at the same time funding a number of new initiatives and dealing with the compliance cost. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Ramsey with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets ","Hey, good afternoon everyone. Question for you. As I think about the incremental cost and the sub-debt that you guys issued after swapping it to variable rate, what is the drag you expect that to have on your margin in the third quarter? Is that a couple of basis points? ","David Rosato","Sure. Hey Bob, it\u2019s David. It\u2019s a basis point or two to the margin going forward. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets ","Okay. And I think you guys in the past have said margin for the year to be between $310 million and $320 million and I guess that guidance still applies here. ","David Rosato","Yes, it does. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets ","Great. On the joint venture, just -- I know you guys have talked a lot about it. Just curious what changes, which events are coming through that I know you guys highlighted in the release you\u2019ve worked with Vantiv for the last eight years. Just can you help me understand what the joint venture, what\u2019s different on a go forward basis?","Kirk Walters ","I\u2019ll take the first -- we\u2019re getting an echo here somewhere. I don\u2019t know why.  But I\u2019ll take a first crack at it and then Jack can add on to it. One of the primary things that they bring to the table other than technology deeper products and a lot of good things is that there will be a much larger dedicated sales force that will be calling not only on our customers\u2019 referrals, but on other non-People\u2019s customers in our footprint. And that sales force is really tasked with moving us along in terms of the merchant processing business. And that will be managed by people at Vantiv to have a real expertise and increase the sales effort there. So I think that plus for our customers really a better product set, better technology, better security round, it\u2019s all a plus. ","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets ","And do you guys get an edge or an in on cross selling other commercial banking services from People\u2019s to customer of Vantiv that maybe today are not People\u2019s banking clients?","John Barnes","Absolutely. Sorry, this is Jack. You get that opportunity, but we also get the opportunity to again sell capabilities on the merchant processing side into some of our larger corporate clients that Vantiv has a lot more experiences dealing with, some very significant entities, merchants that have unique processing needs. There\u2019s a lot of expertise in the business around different types of merchants and we\u2019ll bring a lot more of that to the table. So that will help build, deepen the relationships we have with some of our largest customers as well.","Robert Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets ","Okay, great. Last question I guess I\u2019ve got for you guys has to do with resi mortgages. And just that the growth this quarter was a little slower than it has been in past quarters. Growth overall was good, but not the resi mortgage bucket. And the mortgage banking income was not real strong this quarter either. So it doesn\u2019t appear that you guys were selling more production. Just kind of curious if that\u2019s a reflection of less demand in your markets or whether it\u2019s a reflection of you all\u2019s appetite for the product at current rates or sort of what\u2019s your thinking in the resi mortgage area?","David Rosato","Hey Bob, it\u2019s David again. Now I would just say we saw a few months slowdown in our markets and consumer demand. Nothing different on our part as far as the attractiveness of the business or our desire to hold the assets. And I would say that in June and then into July, we have seen the pipelines rebuild both for pipeline, for the balance sheet as well as pipeline for sale. So we think a recovery from the seasonal slowdown is in place.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed.","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Hi guys. The first question is on the margin on slide 20 in your deck looking at the adjusted net interest margin, without the accretion of 304 which is down from 308. In the current interest rate environment, where do you see that adjusted margin going over the next year?","Kirk Walters","Matt, it\u2019s Kirk. I\u2019ll take a first crack at that. I mean we\u2019ve given really no guidance other than our initial guidance for the year of 310 to 320. We do expect over time as the acquired loans rolling off that that will \u2013 there may be a little continued drift in there in relation to that acquired portfolio. On the originated portfolio, the new loans coming on are coming great, relatively close to where the portfolio yield is if you adjust it for the acquired loans.","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, but over time you get to that adjusted margin once that total 152 on amortized discount is gone, right? ","John Barnes","Over time the rate in environment will change one way or another and as it does then that change is going to impact both our floating rate loans for sure and deposit costs.","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Yeah, got you. On the \u2026","David Rosato","Hey Matt, it\u2019s David. I would just add that that will bleed in over a fairly long period of time as well. It\u2019s not going to disappear quickly.","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Fair enough. What about your reserve coverage on originated loans? It was down a little bit, 75 basis points. Where can we expect that to go over the next year?","Kirk Walters","I think we\u2019ve been holding it at a fairly consistent type range. We give obviously disclosures in our deck in terms of reserves and commercial reserves in residential. And as we\u2019ve indicated, we continue to put away provision every quarter for the growth. So charge offs continue to be really minimal and in fact as we indicated in our commentary, a lot of them are against specific reserves for the bulk of the \u2013 the bulk of the provision we\u2019re booking is for the allowance or for the growth, sorry.","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay. So it could go down a little more? That could come in a little further the reserve company.","Kirk Walters","I think we\u2019ve been in a pretty consistent range there, a couple basis points so yeah, not moving a lot.","John Barnes","I think it probably is worth mentioning that a driver in the reserve analysis is the level of problem loans, right? And we\u2019ve operated consistent -- we\u2019ve been improving. We have a history of a relative basis, having a relatively lower amount. So that\u2019s part of it. And we did have some rating upgrades and that\u2019s part of the analysis. ","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Yeah, got you. And then just the last question, in your NII sensitivity that you guys updated this quarter, in the up 200 basis point environment, the immediate parallel shock, what's assumed in there? What's embedded in deposit runoff in that analysis? Or change in deposit balances? ","John Barnes","There\u2019s really no exclusive assumption that I would say around deposit runoffs. We model a projected balance sheet over the next 12 months and we\u2019re expecting our deposit base to grow, not to shrink in that underlying scenario. ","Matthew Kelley \u2013Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, got it. Actually one last one, what's the mortgage warehouse balance? And how much was that a driver of the C&I growth this quarter?","John Barnes","Let me see as we think about trying to find the balance. So the balance is a little over $0.5 billion on the outstanding side and which is up from \u2013 just under. I am sorry, just under $0.5 billion, but up over $100 million from last quarter. ","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Two questions. First on the tax rate. It looks like it was a little bit higher this quarter. Did it have anything to do with the gain from the JV or was there anything else that drove that?","Kirk Walters","It really is -- what's driving it is higher state taxes. There\u2019s probably a couple of factors. One, in the first quarter, we like others in the state of New York, pay taxes and the state of New York receives some benefit right at the end of the quarter. Last quarter, they came through. They helped a bit. The other part is we continue to see growth in our income. The permanent differences have less impact on it. So the \u2013 but the primary driver in there is higher state taxes. ","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay. And then the other question, I was looking at the CRE yields in the quarter. It looks like they were down by seven basis points for the portfolio. In the New York City piece, not to get too specific, but where are you guys originating or what yield are originating new CRE loans? And how do you guys think you compare to the market rate?","Kirk Walters","I think we\u2019re in competing with everybody else. So I think the reality is as we are a reflection of the market rate. Our spreads tended to run in there and we look at things and spreads, not yields. But our spreads have run probably 150 to 175 basis points in terms of the multifamily type product in New York City. And when you look at the overall decline in CRE yields; you need to remember that that line carries a lot of the acquired loan tenants. So as those who continue to run down, they have a proportionate impact on that line. ","John Barnes","Just take the opportunity as well to mention the non-multifamily in New York, our Long Island team is growing their portfolio in a very strong pace and building relationships that are long-term and really attractive to us. And I know we get a lot of questions about New York multifamily, but we really are having and making some nice progress in the non-multifamily area as well. And we\u2019ve just hired a very experienced gentleman who\u2019s basically got a career in New York City, and we are looking forward to some continued progress there. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire, with Jefferies. Please proceed. ","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Good afternoon guys. Just question on the fee outlook. It came in a little light \u2013 lighter than I was expecting. If memory serves, you guys are calling for it to be flat with 2013 at around 336. And halfway through the year, you guys are running about 5% behind that. I'm just curious, is that still a good guide? And if so, what are the drivers from here outside of this JV obviously?","John Barnes"," Yes, we\u2019re -- I would believe it is a good guide, but we see the challenge there. I think the biggest piece for us in the quarter was that even though we, as we described we projected the refinance to slow significantly and gain on sale to be down. It was down a little further than we expected. And on the other hand, we look across our other fee businesses and there is a lot of them and we are doing better in asset management. Really have made some nice progress there and we anticipate that to continue to move forward. Brokerage is better and there\u2019s a variety of the pieces of the fee income that are -- so like always as you move through a year you\u2019ve got some puts and takes, but we are continuing to make progress.","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. And then just switching to balance sheet mix, curious, obviously the commercial momentum has been great in shrinking the securities book. Obviously wondering where you guys stand today as it relates to the QTL test? Obviously last fourth quarter you guys took some action with the commercial book growing and the securities book shrinking. Where do you guys stand today and are you going to be looking to take action to get on sides with the QTL? ","John Barnes ","As you probably know every quarter in the call report we\u2019re asked to report where we are with the QTL and we are consistently and need to be in compliance. We continue to be in good stead in terms of our QTL compliance. As we continue to grow and monitor that, as we did last year I think the typical resolution, but not the only resolution, is to add mortgage backed securities that qualify. We continue to follow that. We are in compliance and continuing to move forward. ","Casey Haire \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. You don\u2019t anticipate adding MBS to stay in compliance in the near term?","John Barnes ","I would say at \u2013 there\u2019s not a specific projection here, Casey, but we probably will add a little toward the end of the year depending on where our gross comes from. ","Kirk Walters","It would really be in the context of overall balance sheet management, not only driven towards QTL requirements. ","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Tom Alonso with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Tom Alonso - Macquarie ","Hey, guys, just a quick one on the Vantiv JV. I just want to make sure that I\u2019m thinking about the impact here on the income statement correctly. All else equal we shouldn\u2019t see a big jump up in the other income line next quarter. This is more ... your share of the JV on a net basis should be similar to the income that you were reporting and then over time you expect that to grow a little bit faster. Is that how we should think about it? "," John Barnes ","Yes. That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019ve contributed our portfolio. We will earn that. We do have some expense reduction, but it\u2019s very modest and then we\u2019ll move forward growing the business with Vantiv over the long term. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","On the loan yield topic, real quick, on that commercial real estate spread that you gave, is that over your funding -- is that spread over your funding cost or is that spread over the respective benchmark prime over LIBOR? ","Kirk Walters","Are you referring to the multifamily number? ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Yes. ","Kirk Walters","That\u2019s over whatever would be the respective terms over the five year loan or seven year or four year or 10 year. So I say we think about things in relations to spreads over whatever the match terms are. There\u2019s very limited amount of those that are floating rate loans. Most of those are fixed rate loans.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","All right. So that 150 to 175 spread for multifamily, that\u2019s down from about 185 bps I think you had indicated in the first quarter, correct? ","Kirk Walters","I think in the first quarter I indicated a range because I typically give a range but it is down a little bit from there, yes. ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Okay. And can I get some more numbers from you on the commercial yields? You overall commercial yield for the portfolio was down 9 bps this quarter. So can help us out with where the new spreads are for that portfolio versus last quarter?","Kirk Walters","For which -- I want to make sure I\u2019m answering your question. Which quarter in particular?","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","This quarter versus last quarter, how did the spread for the C&I portfolio change? Like what is the spread and how did it change versus last quarter? ","Kirk Walters","I think if you look at sort of your classic middle market type of spread, quarter to quarter, we probably came down around 8 to 10 basis points that range. ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Okay. So that\u2019s the lion share of the driver behind the 9 basis point decline in the overall yield for the commercial portfolio this quarter, correct? ","Kirk Walters","Well and remember as I had commented earlier, John, when you look at the overall commercial portfolio, that\u2019s where the bulk of the acquired assets reside. And if those are running down in higher yields that impacts it too. ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Okay. I just thought you were talking about CRE when you made that comment. Okay. All right, and then on the broker deposits, your balance is currently around $1.3 billion, correct? ","John Barnes ","That\u2019s correct. ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners","So are you still on track to reach $2 billion by the end of the year?","John Barnes ","Yes. That was our expectation.","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Okay. And what rate and term are bringing on the broker deposits? ","John Barnes ","As we said in the prepared remarks, about 80% is money market. The money markets are coming in between 15 and 25 basis points and the balance is in CDs of different maturity ranges. We\u2019ve been issuing three months to about two years. That average cost is 30 to 35 basis points. You can do the math, but it\u2019s very cost effective funding for us. ","John Pancari - Evercore Partners ","Okay. And then my last question is around expenses. I know you gave a little bit of color around the run rate of expense. In terms of your expectation for the efficiency ratio, do you still expect the low 60s efficiency ratio by year end 2014 and do you also still expect a below 60% longer term range? ","Kirk Walters","The answer would be yes to the first one and I\u2019d say on longer term basis we still continue to work very hard to drive that efficiency ratio down. ","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill and Partners. ","Mark Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill and Partners","Good afternoon, guys I wondered if you could share with us which geographies in your franchise are performing best where you\u2019re seeing the best loan growth and fee revenues and that sort of thing.","John Barnes ","It\u2019s such a mix because of the difference between say the long term legacy markets where incremental growth is meaningful, but doesn\u2019t necessarily have a growth rate off of a smaller denominator. So we are making great progress in Massachusetts, particularly in the greater Boston area. And we see that pace continuing to pick up nicely. We were very pleased with the evolution of the commercial teams and actually all of the teams in Boston working together well. They\u2019re cross selling really effectively. We are growing C&I portfolio and the commercial real estate portfolio well. There\u2019s an ABL team that I think some of you folks would recognize has been there through the Danvers acquisition and actually legacy Citizens Group that has worked together a long time. They are making good process. In New York, we are doing really well on Long Island with both the C&I team and the commercial real estate team and their growth rates are significant. ","Westchester County, C&I team is making really nice progress and you\u2019ve heard a lot about multifamily. They put $1billion on last year and they\u2019re not going to do that this year, but they\u2019re doing well. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve made what we think is a really great new hire in New York on leading the commercial real estate, the non-multi-group and we expect to continue to make continued progress in that area as well. I guess the other thing \u2013 I'm sorry, you asked, but on the equipment finance area, we\u2019re getting steady growth in both the old finFET and our PCLC group and I would say both of those groups are making really great progress. We\u2019re really pleased with it. ABL is growing steady, a little bit slower than the equipment finance groups, but their pipeline and good and we feel really good about the steady improvement that they\u2019re making. ","Mark Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill and Partners","Jack, second question. Thank you. That was helpful, that color. You have a really strong acquisition currency. Do you think acquisitions are in the cards for People\u2019s in the near term?","John Barnes ","I think the view is the same as we always start with. We don\u2019t need to do an acquisition to keep doing what we\u2019re doing here. And we think about it that way. I have been active in building relationships. I feel really good about doing that. I think we\u2019ve got a good view within the northeast, which with who would make sense for us. And so we\u2019ll continue to contemplate that and if things are right, we\u2019ll work at it. But the environment around that is as you know also, very different than it was. So mostly, we\u2019re focused on growing these opportunities out and taking advantage of our positioning and if something makes good sense because of the strength of our situation, we\u2019ll look at it. ","Mark Fitzgibbon - Sandler O'Neill and Partners","Thank you. And the last question I had is, recently we\u2019ve been hearing a lot from many similar sized banks about the need for incremental spending to deal with the increased regulatory burden. I wondered if you could comment on whether you\u2019re seeing that or you anticipate that and what kind of impact it's likely to have on expenses in maybe the intermediate term?","John Barnes ","Yeah. So I think we\u2019ve mentioned this in the past as well, but I\u2019ll run through some categories and give you some perspective. And I will start with, we are not anticipating any incremental surge having to do with that. We have built out our risk areas and compliance operational risk BSA over the last three years. And we\u2019ve made incremental increases in staffing and built out new expectations around things like compliance testing, operational risk, staffing and evaluation, software that relates to operational risk monitoring and governance and BSA staffing. ","We just went operational with a new piece of software there that we\u2019ve spent money on. And in the stress testing area, we\u2019ve been stress testing and building our capabilities steadily there for three years. As David often describes, we\u2019re building our stress testing capability to be a CCAR-like. So as I describe all that, in our expenses over the last three years, those spends and the incremental impact on staffing and the like are in the numbers, which is why we comment about being pleased with our expense management overall despite having spent more money on the regulatory environment. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the time we have for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.

First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Stacy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Peter Goulding, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Peter Goulding","Good morning. And thank you for joining us today. Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kirk Walters, our Chief Financial Officer; along with Jeff Hoyt, our Controller, are here with me to review our first quarter results. Before we get started, please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on Slide 1 of our presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. On Slide 2, we provide an overview of our first quarter results. For the quarter, operating earnings were $60.6 million or $0.18 per share with net income of $58.6 million or $0.17 per share. As was somewhat expected, the operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% compared to 4.07% operating margin in the fourth quarter. The decline in the margin is the result of lower loan yields due to continued repricing of the originated loan portfolio and deposit growth outstripping loan growth, which was partially offset by lower funding costs.","Total loan growth, including runoff in the acquired portfolios amounted to 1.7% on an annualized basis, which was entirely funded by deposit growth. Originated loan growth was strong and amounted to 7.5% on an annualized basis. Deposit growth for the quarter reached 8.7% on an annualized basis. Deposit rates declined by another 6 basis points to 44 basis points in the quarter. Noninterest income improved compared to the fourth quarter due to growth in the gain on sale of residential loans, investment management fees, brokerage commissions and insurance, which was partially offset by decreases in loan prepayment fees and service charges.","The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% from 61.8% in the fourth quarter. This is a result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower net interest income due to slower loan growth and a decline in the net interest margin. Capital ratios remained strong. We continue to deploy capital thoughtfully through organic growth, dividends, share repurchases and our acquisition strategy. The tangible equity ratio stands at 11.7% as of first quarter 2012, which is well in excess of our peers.","On Slide 3, we discuss several recent initiatives. First, we launched our brand messaging, \"What know-how can do,\" during the quarter and have received strong positive feedback throughout our footprint. We continue to roll out this messaging through various media channels including our website, billboards and television commercials. Second, as was announced in our press release, we increased our dividend for the 20th consecutive year. As of yesterday's closing price, and adjusting for the new dividend rate of $0.64 per share annually, the annual dividend yield on our common stock is 5%. Third, we repurchased 4.5 million shares, or $56 million, at a weighted average price of $12.54 per share. This results in approximately $3 million of annual dividend savings. We have 13.5 million shares remaining in our existing share repurchase authorization.","Next, we announced the acquisition of 56 Citizens branches in the New York metro area on February 28. 52 of the branches are situated in Stop & Shop supermarkets and 4 are traditional branches. 29 are located on Long Island, 8 are in Westchester County and 6 are in the boroughs of the New York City. All of which are key areas of focus for People's United. A substantial opportunity exists to expand the acquired deposit base as Citizens branches had average in-store deposits of $4 million. Our current Connecticut in-store franchise averages $29 million in deposits based on the location of the original account opening or $40 million in deposits if you account for where the customers conduct their banking activity. We look forward to closing this transaction in late June and begin to address in earnest the growth potential that exists in our New York metro franchise.","Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, as we discussed and as demonstrated in our originated loan and deposit growth and certain fee income business lines, this franchise has momentum. We are particularly pleased with the momentum across wealth management, insurance, brokerage, cash management and payroll service product lines. We have every reason to believe that the momentum will continue as we attract and retain top talent while remaining completely focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our competitive, conservative credit culture. ","Along these lines, we recently hired additional talent to support our New York commercial lending unit. This unit will benefit from the deepening presence afforded by the upcoming acquisition of select Citizens branches in New York metro area. For years now, we have participated in the New York Commercial Real Estate lending market. However, as with our asset-based lending portfolio, it is underrepresented relative to the size and geography of our franchise. Our asset-based lending business has made significant progress and is up 18% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We also recently strengthened our wealth management team, deepening our talent in both Fairfield County and the Boston market.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Kirk.","Kirk W. Walters","Thank you, Jack. On Slide 4, you can see a breakdown of the elements contributing to our 4.01% reported and operating margin for the quarter. As you'll recall, our fourth quarter operating net interest margin was 4.07%, and the GAAP margin was 4.16%. The difference was attributable to 9 basis points of cost recovery income related to Bank of Smithtown as a result of our fourth quarter reassessment. The effects of lower loan yields further reduced the margin by 9 basis points. Finally, we had one less calendar day in the quarter, which adversely affected the margin by 3 basis points. Partially offsetting these negatives was a benefit of 6 basis points due to lower funding rates.","On Slide 5, you can see that our operating net interest margin declined to 4.01% in the quarter. The decline was somewhat expected and is primarily a result of the continued low interest rate environment where loan repricings are outpacing our ability to lower deposit costs. We also experienced increased deposit growth alongside slower loan growth.","Our strong margin is a product of our low-cost stable funding, good loan mix and solid capital levels, all of which means that we do not need to stretch on credit. In addition, our margin is and will continue to be supported by $1.3 billion of accretable yield resulting from 5 acquisitions closed within the last 2 years. Let me provide a little more detail on the next slide.","Slide 6 links closely with our discussion of the net interest margin. For the quarter, interest accretion on acquired loans totaled approximately $60 million, down from $68 million in the fourth quarter. And the carrying amount of acquired loans at period end totaled $3.4 billion.","Slide 7 provides a breakdown and the elements contributing to our net increase in loans. As Jack noted earlier, the loan portfolios produced 7.5% quarter-over-quarter annualized originated loan growth or total loan growth of 1.7% quarter-over-quarter annualized. We believe we operate in the best commercial banking market in the United States and are one of the few banks that can credibly offer the full product suite of a large bank while maintaining our outstanding customer service standards. ","Originated loan growth for the quarter totaled $314 million. As in prior quarters, growth came from a variety of products in geographic areas. Originated commercial loans increased $187 million quarter-over-quarter, which included increases of $153 million and $73 million from C&I and equipment financing, respectively and a $39 million decline in commercial real estate originated loans. ","Within C&I, we saw strength across all categories, but I would highlight 2 businesses. In particular, PCLC, one of our equipment financing businesses, grew originated loans $19 million in the quarter. And encouragingly, People's United Equipment Finance grew originated loans $54 million. With strong pipelines, we feel loan growth momentum will continue to build in the second quarter.","Originated residential mortgages grew by $156 million, or 20% annualized. Of the residential mortgage originations, approximately 87% were hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages. 64% of the pipeline is jumbo product. First quarter 2012 origination to average loan size was $599,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter originations was 754 with an average LTV of 62%. Originated Home Equity loans declined by $11 million. We are in the market with a promotion right now and are seeing good traction. ","Loan closings totaled $126 million in commitments compared to $150 million in the fourth quarter of '11. In terms of recent originations, the average line size of the first quarter '12 originations was 121,000. The average FICO score for the first quarter was 759 with an average combined loan-to-value of 57%. 100% of Home Equity loans are retail originated.","You can see on Slide 8 a breakdown of the elements contributing to our net increase in deposits. We break out the deposits into retail and commercial, which reflects the way we manage the business. In any given quarter, one segment may be more volatile than another, but we feel good about our deposit base and our ability to grow from here, especially given overall growth of 8.7% for the quarter. Deposit growth was partially impacted by bringing $275 million in deposits onto the balance sheet. This balance consisted of $135 million from a new cash suite product, $57 million from checking accounts and $83 million from customer credit balances of people's securities, all of which impacted commercial deposits. ","Our consumer deposit base grew $310 million while the commercial deposit base increased $142 million. All of this occurred while overall deposit costs fell by 6 basis points to 44 basis points. This decrease was experienced across all product lines. In addition, we continue to manage a mix shift from time to demand and savings or money market deposits   within the acquired institutions. Deposit mix improved as non-interest-bearing and savings deposits represented 74.8% of total average deposits in the first quarter versus 73.7% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Average total deposits were up $246 million quarter-over-quarter. Annualized deposit growth was greater than annualized loan growth.","As you heard me say before, loan growth funded entirely by deposit growth is the best way to drive earnings. We believe the second and third quarter will be seasonally stronger from a loan origination perspective, making good use of the additional deposit funding we gathered this quarter.","Slide 9 is an important lens for us as we think about the growth that has occurred in the company and will occur in the quarters ahead. We have managed to successfully grow loans and deposits while maintaining excellent asset quality. We know that if we grow loans and deposits per share, increase the income and continue to reduce costs, we will produce greater recurring earnings per share. It is really very simple. Over the past 2 years, loans per share and deposits per share have grown at compound annual rates of 16% and 18%, respectively.","Slide 10 provides a breakout of noninterest income. Our noninterest income increased slightly from the fourth quarter. Loan prepayment fees and bank service charges declined by a total of $3.2 million, which was offset by higher gain on sale of residential loans of $1.9 million, increased insurance revenue of $1.2 million and increased trust and brokerage fees of $900,000. Additional fee income areas that have demonstrated momentum are cash management and payroll services, which increased 20% and 68%, respectively on a quarter-over-quarter annualized basis. Some seasonality was noted in the insurance business. The first and third quarters are always seasonally stronger.","On Slide 11, you can see that our noninterest expense base improved to $209 million from $230 million last quarter. The largest part of this decrease was in non-operating expenses, which declined $20 million to $3 million in the current quarter. This quarter, non-operating expenses including -- included $2.4 million of severance and $600,000 of other one-time charges. In addition, as part of our ongoing effort to maximize that work, we recently announced the sale of our Leominster branch at a reasonable deposit premium.","As we think about noninterest expense, we're focused on the operating noninterest expense base. The first quarter run rate expense base was $205.6 million, down from $207.2 million last quarter. We expect that during the course of 2012, we will be steadily walking the quarterly run rate down such that are targeted full-year operating expense base should be in the range of $800 million to $830 million, which includes the impact of the Citizens branch transaction.","Going forward, positive expense reduction initiatives include a favorable trend in fraud-related charges, lower-than-anticipated rent expense, reduced depreciation expense, savings and check processing charges and courier fees due to negotiated contract reductions and a reduction in core processing IT expense.","On Slide 11, we provide a historical perspective of our efficiency ratio. As you may have noted in our non-GAAP reconciliation contained within the earnings release, we have made a change in the calculation of the efficiency ratio in order to treat purchase accounting related fair value adjustments more consistently. In recent years, total noninterest expense, the numerator, was adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired premises and equipment while total revenue, the denominator, was suggested to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to liabilities assumed.","Prior to the adoption of FASB statement 141R in 2009, total revenue was also adjusted to exclude the effects of fair value adjustments related to acquired loans. This practice, however, became impractical under the accretable yield accounting model for acquired loans, which has been applied to all portfolios acquired since that date. In the interest of simplicity and transparency, beginning this quarter, the efficiency ratio will no longer reflect any purchase accounting-related adjustments other than normal amortization of intangibles. All prior periods have been adjusted so as to be presented on a comparable basis. The impact of this change in the efficiency ratio for each of the periods present was a favorable 80 to 90 basis points.","The efficiency ratio rose to 63.2% for the first quarter compared to 61.8% in the fourth quarter, but was down from 65.4% in the first quarter of 2011. This is essentially the result of seasonally higher operating expenses and lower revenue growth driven by slower loan growth and a declining net interest margin. However, loan pipeline turns significantly stronger this quarter than last quarter, and we are seeing higher utilization rates on commercial lines consistent with improved borrower confidence. We remain on track to reach our 55% efficiency rate, run rate goal in 2013.","Slides 13 and 14 are a reminder of our excellent credit quality. We did see an improvement in nonperforming assets this quarter. NPAs decreased from $336 million to $316 million, a $20 million decrease. Nonperforming assets at 1.85% of originated loans and REO remained well below our peer group and Top 50 banks.","Looking at Slide 14, net charge-offs improved to 22 basis points compared to 29 basis points last quarter and remain at approximately 30% of our peers. These levels continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our nonperforming assets. Over the last 4 quarters, charge-offs against specific reserves represent approximately 45% of total charge-offs. As such, we understand our credit issues well and typically have very few new credit events each quarter. The largest component to this quarter's charge-offs relates to one out-of-market real estate Shared National Credit, which represents approximately 40% of net charge-offs for the period.","On Slide 15, you can see the detail for the allowance for loan losses by loan category. A few items of note. Our allowance for loan losses to commercial loans is 1.34%, with a coverage ratio of 79% of commercial NPLs. As we have stated previously, we have a strict loan loss allowance methodology, which is consistently applied. That said, mixed shift and new originations can result in modest changes in the overall coverage ratio in any given quarter. Provision for loan losses reflects $11.2 million in charge-offs, including $4.8 million with previously established specific reserves, $4.8 million of additional allowance build in response to loan growth and $300,000 of impairment associated with acquired loans.","Now I'll pass it back to Jack.","John P. Barnes","Thank you, Kirk. On Slide 16, you can see our operating return on average assets for the first quarter was 0.88%, up slightly from the fourth quarter. As we've talked about earlier, we have momentum. We expect that momentum to accelerate as we continue to attract and retain top talent while remaining focused on best serving our customers and maintaining our conservative credit culture. Additionally, progress on our expense initiatives for the year will result in improved return profile for the franchise.","On Slide 17, we expect to see an increase in return on average tangible equity as we improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy capital. Our significant capital levels remain approximately 370 basis points above peers, which produced below industry return on average tangible equity. Normalizing our equity base shows that the core bank is performing well at 11.7% when we turn on average tangible equity. On Slide 18, consistent with the outline of our financial targets, we expect to see our operating dividend payout ratio to trend lower through 2012.","On Slide 19, we have updated our capital ratios for both the holding company and the bank. Capital levels remain very strong with our tangible common equity ratio at 11.7% and Tier 1 Common at 14%, which compares well to our peers at 8% and 10.9% as of the fourth quarter, respectively.","The group -- excuse me, the GAAP narrows as we deploy capital and our peers build capital. While our tangible common equity ratio remains much higher than our peers, on a total risk-based capital basis, we are much closer to peers. We really are a commercial bank and as a result, have a large amount of 100% risk-weighted assets.","And on Slide 20, our robust pipelines and strong originated loan growth contribute to our continued momentum with the franchise, which we expect to accelerate in the coming quarters. The strength of our platform continues to allow us to attract and retain exceptional talent and provide us a sustainable competitive advantage. This concludes our presentation. ","And now, we'll be happy to answer any questions that you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Damon DelMonte with KBW.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Could you guys talk a little bit about your -- the loan pipeline? I think you made a couple of comments, you thought second and third quarter were shaping up pretty good. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing and in which asset classes?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, we're actually seeing a very strong pipeline in the residential area continuing, and the pace of that seems to have been building through the year. And we don't see any change right now in that area at all. In the C&I area, we continue to see strengthening and feel very good about the general pace of activity. We mentioned the ABL group and the growth during the quarter. We feel good, that, that component of it is growing very well. We're seeing a lot of deal to flow there. And the commercial real estate area, there's, I'd say, a consistent flow in terms of the pipeline and -- but a very competitive environment.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it looks like -- Jack, it looks like the yield on commercial real estate loans decreased pretty substantially quarter-over-quarter upwards to almost 50 basis points but the balances were kind of flat there. Could you talk a little bit about the pricing and what you're seeing?","John P. Barnes","Yes, Damon, let me take a crack at that. You need to remember, in the fourth quarter, we had the cost recovery income that came in via Bank of Smithtown. And that's the whole deal under the acquired loan accounting, to the extent that you have individually accounted for loans and you recover more when you dispose them than what you mark them at that, in fact, it goes through the margin. And all of that went through the commercial real estate side.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","So it kind of inflated the yield in the fourth quarter then?","John P. Barnes","Right, right. And we reported, if you look back at all of our notes within the K and such, we reported the impact of that. So when you look at quarter to quarter on pricing, I'd say certainly, the area that we see being the most competitive on pricing continues to be the commercial real estate arena, with a lot of players in including the life insurance companies. Otherwise, I'd say overall, pricing has held in pretty well in terms of our C&I books and the other lines of business that we have. But certainly, the area we feel it most in is commercial real estate. And I'd once again reemphasize that anybody that's looking at fourth to first that the fourth quarter number is inflated.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then Kirk, with respect to expenses, did you say that you'd be whacking the expense base down to an annual rate of $800 million to $830 million?","Kirk W. Walters","Right.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Is that for 2012?","Kirk W. Walters","That's for 2012.","Damon Paul DelMonte - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is that different than what you had said last quarter?","Kirk W. Walters","It is because we've included in that the Citizens branches. Yes. When you look last quarter, we gave a range of $790 million to $810 million, and we've upped that because we are expecting to close in the Citizens branches the end of the second quarter. And if you look at the range, that's consistent with the guidance that we put out that the time of the announcement of the branches.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just following up on the question on expenses. So Kirk, with the new -- the $800 million to $830 million, does that change -- and I know you put it in the slide deck, that 55% efficiency target, but does that change the timing of getting to 55%? Or how does the dynamic look there?","Kirk W. Walters","I think the dynamic there is that originally, we are looking more toward mid-2013 and now, we're looking toward the latter part of 2013 because as we discussed when we announced Citizens, we do end up with a slight negative impact tune of about $0.01 a share for '12 and '13 in the transaction until we can get the average deposits up in those branches.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then you talked about the momentum that you guys are seeing on the fee side, which is great. So there's not -- there wasn't anything in particular in terms of seasonality in this first quarter that would have elevated any of those line items?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, we end up with seasonality going both ways, but I mean, the one business that clearly has seasonality we reported on in previous quarters is the first and third quarters are the biggest quarters for the insurance business, the way the renewals run. On the other side, we tend to see fourth quarter stronger on bank service charges and quite often loan prepayment fees than the first quarter. So if you look at the table as we walked fourth to first, you see loan prepayment fees down, bank service charges down and of course, fourth and first had the full quarters of Durbin in it. And then on the other side, you see insurance up some.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just looking at -- trying to sort of reconcile the direction on net interest income. Obviously, you guys talked about the margin and the impact of the recovery in the fourth quarter. But just in terms of overall dollars, can you talk a little bit about that? I know you -- it sounds like you're pretty optimistic about the loan pipeline coming in, in the second and third quarters, but maybe how the securities, kind of your tolerance for growing the securities book fits into all that?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure, let me take a crack at this. First, I think in terms of net interest income, on the loan side, we need to remember that we are fighting, and you can see it easily in our charts, the continued heavy prepayments on the acquired loans. And part of that relates to the old Fin Fed book, which really had an average life of about 3 years. And we're in the third year of that at this point. And so that is something that continues to come through, and that obviously is that continues to pay down and impacts the accretion that we're able to book quarter-over-quarter. So that's a couple of things on the acquired loans that I think we've talked about in the fourth quarter. And certainly, we have a lot of detail out there on. In terms of the originated books, I think we continue to see good loan growth there, probably a little slower than what we did on the latter part of last year. We are optimistic with the pipelines we have as that kicks in to more of the seasonally stronger periods for us of the second and third quarter. But overall, I think we face the same challenges as others in terms of the low interest rate environment. Some level of loan repricing is continuing on in the book that we're continuing to manage through. To your question on the securities portfolio, I think we've by and large held it pretty flat, maybe up a bit. And we had some stuff to settle in the fourth quarter that's increased in averages. But by and large, I think it's pretty flat.","Collyn Bement Gilbert - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And your anticipation is keeping it flat for the remainder of the year? Or is that going to be...","Kirk W. Walters","It'll probably pretty well be flat, but it depends a little bit on deposit growth. We did have a really good first quarter on deposit growth. And as that comes in, if we continue to see stronger numbers there, we may do a little bit of what we're doing right now, which is very short duration CMOs as a placeholder until we're able to put it into loan growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe I'll start, in terms of the previously announced cost savings right there, a lot of moving pieces here. To keep it simple, Kirk, maybe could you give how much cost has already been taken out of the company? And what are the dollars that's left?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I think if you look at sort of a run rate including all the acquisitions, different things that have come in from last year, there's probably been $60 million to $70 million taken out. And the general goal is to continue to drive that number down. We had originally, I think, advertised the number probably in the -- between $750 million and $800 million in terms of run rates. That number's a little higher now because of the Citizens transaction, it's probably $20 million to $30 million higher.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So are we talking another $30 million or so to come out of in terms of just expense cuts outside of deals?","Kirk W. Walters","I would say a range of probably $20 million to $30 million in there.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, on the buybacks, there's been quite a bit of variability quarter to quarter. I'm curious what are you guys looking at that's dictating the pace of buybacks as certain stock price that you're more active? Just wondering what's going on there.","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I think the guidance that we've given is that we expect it to be -- the buybacks to occur pretty evenly throughout the year against our 5% authorization. If there's particular weakness in the stock in a given quarter, we may buy back a little more. But I think last year was more of an anomaly and that we started the buybacks after Danvers, but heavily required in the fourth quarter. But I think first quarter is much more consistent with how you'll see the year.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then, one final question. Kirk, can you talk about maybe expectations for margin the rest of the year? And is there any big headwind from accretion benefit running out that we should be thinking about?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. I think as you look at the margin for the rest of the year, the original guidance we gave was that we were hoping to hold it above 4% through the second quarter and then see it slipping under 4% in the last 2 quarters. The primary difference between the consensus estimates out there in the margin of the 4.04% and the 4.01% that we reported primarily relates to the loan volume and loan activity in the first quarter and also the fact that we brought in a lot of deposits and in fact put it into -- left it at the Fed until the loan growth catches up in the second, third quarter. As we look forward, we would expect, I think, in the second quarter that we are going to slip a bit below the 4% handle. And then as we go through the third and fourth quarters, continue down a bit more. The primary -- to your question on accretion, the primary factor that's impacting us on accretion quarter to quarter as we go through this year, will be the Fin Fed accretion, which will effectively run out and be done at the end of the year.","Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So once we get to the end of the year, then we'll take this pressure off the margin, theoretically?","Kirk W. Walters","Yes. I mean, you still have -- under the accretion for Bank of Smithtown and Danvers, you'll still see it come down a bit but not at the pace that it does with Fin Fed. I mean, those tend to be much longer duration assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Kelley with Sterne Agee.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","On your bank service charges, what are you anticipating for growth over the course of the next year? Maybe just talk about how you process transactions. You are high to low, sequential low to high and your thoughts on that subject something that regulators have been taking a closer look at and just talk about bank service charges, deposits and checking account fees?","Kirk W. Walters","I think overall, on bank service charges, we tend to find the first quarter to be one of the more seasonally low periods on bank service charges and then building a bit as we go through the year. So I think from the number you see here, I would expect to see subject to any other regulatory changes and such. So I'll get to the second part of your question then, we would tend to see that number increase as we go through the year, just from a seasonality standpoint. On the question of, do we sort high to low, we do sort high to low. And as far as that particular issue, we know there's proposed guidance out there, but there has been nothing finalized on it.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","If you processed on a sequential basis, what would the change be just versus current levels?","John P. Barnes","We're looking at approximately $1.5 million in income based on the analysis that we've done to date on that.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Annually?","John P. Barnes","Correct.","Matthew Brandon Kelley - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, got you. And then, can you just talk real quickly about what you've sold on the mortgage book, the mortgage loans, the gain on sale, margins you're experiencing, the types of assets you are selling and what you think we should expect going forward there?","Kirk W. Walters","That, what's flowing through that line is just a normal mortgage banking activity and we have not reached anything into the portfolio and folded out. So the first quarter, we did see volumes up in terms of, anything that's fixed-rate, the 15 and 30 years stuff we originate, whether it's conforming or jumbo, we sell through. And so this quarter, we saw better volumes in the for-sale product, and we also saw better spreads, to be honest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Darst with Guggenheim.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you go back over to some of the details on the acquisition and the cost of funds, and what to expect that to contribute to the margin? And then, what's the horizon you think that'll take to mature those branches up to what you see in your current in-store branches?","Kirk W. Walters","Sure. On the Citizen's acquisition, which we expect to close at the end of the quarter, their overall cost of funds is 42 basis points. And so we have a cost of funds of 44 basis points. So that initially coming in out of the chute will be a bit of a push in there. As we grow those, you may see their costs, the cost of funds in those branches go up a little bit as we run promotions and different things. On the other side, we are still bringing down the cost of funds on the Bank of Smithtown, Danvers acquisitions, which still hover around 1%. So we'll have a little bit of effect on both sides. In terms of the branches themselves, we would need to get them to about $10 million on deposits for a breakeven. The guidance we've given is that we felt that it'd be a negative to the tune of $0.01 a share for this year and next and a breakeven in '14. So effectively, by '14, we'd expect they're paying the freight and then we'd leverage from there. I would remind you that the -- our average brand size, if you look at where our customers branch or Stop & Shop branches, it's a little over $40 million. And so we think the opportunity is significant. We've been in this business a long time, and we feel very optimistic about growing -- having these branches and being able to grow them both on the deposit side as well as the loan side.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And did you mention that you had added some lenders to that market, Long Island?","Kirk W. Walters","We have been continuing to add into our commercial lending teams on Long Island, as well as in Westchester County recently opening an office in White Plains, both in the C&I and the CRE side. And actually in White Plains, we have an ABL person, too.","John P. Barnes","So -- and just to amplify that a little bit, and I think the context, a way for everybody to be thinking of that, as we've mentioned before, following the Smithtown acquisition closing, we've built C&I and commercial real estate teams on the island, and they've been these experienced folks, very long time in the market. And they continue to make progress. And as Kirk referenced, we've been working Westchester market from Connecticut for a number of years and now we have people on the ground there. And in addition, what we did mention in the narrative was that we've recently hired several more people in the commercial real estate market lined up with New York Metro. So we are, as we've indicated, putting a lot of focus there and building -- continuing to build our teams and efforts out.","David Darst - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Will the group in New York focus on traditional commercial real estate? Or will they have any focus on their multifamily or regulated properties?","Kirk W. Walters","I think because of the nature of that market and the fact that we are underrepresented in our commercial real estate book in multifamily, there will be some emphasis on multifamily as we go into that market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Bob Ramsey with FBR.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I was just curious if you could maybe tell me, with the in-store branches that you all already have that are sort of at that $40 million deposit mark, if you ran a P&L for that business, what would the efficiency look like?","Kirk W. Walters","I don't have the numbers right in front of me. But the overall cost of operating an in-store branch is about 1\/3 less than a traditional branch. And I think the other item to note, which most people don't understand, is we do get a nice chunk of loan volume through those branches. If you look at our Connecticut operation, which is a very strong operation, in which we have a little over 80 in-store branches, about 1\/2 of our consumer checking accounts that are opened in Connecticut are opened in those branches. But interestingly enough, if you look on the loan side, 30% of our Home Equities, 30% of our mortgage loans and almost 30% of business banking loans come through those branches, including about 30% of our investment sales. So we've had a good mix of business that tends to come into those that overall makes them profitable and a real plus. The other item I would note is, we do see -- which we don't capture in these numbers, we do see when we open the in-stores, a lift with our business banking in the small end of middle market commercial because we're open 7 days a week, and it's very convenient for them.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And if the cost of the in-store branches are 1\/3 less on traditional, how does the revenue compare?","Kirk W. Walters","Well, I can say in terms of the revenue overall, certainly, I'd say bank service charges, those kind of things, are very similar. And I would say on the loan side, as we just went through here, we're looking at 30% to -- depending on market, 30% to 40% of our retail loan volume and small-business volume coming through the in-stores versus the traditional.","Bob Ramsey - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at is if the expenses are 1\/3 less than a traditional branch, what are the total revenues on a per branch look like compared to a traditional. Are they 1\/3 less as well, so you'd have sort of a similar revenue expense mix?","Kirk W. Walters","No. I would say that on the revenue side, they may be slightly less, but not a lot.","John P. Barnes","I think that, that gets to the point I think Kirk was trying to make, when you think of the products that we're selling through the in-store branches, we very much operate the in-store branches similar to the offering in the traditional branches, which we've been able to establish over a long-term here our success in doing that. And it's one of the very strong reasons why we pursued the Citizen's transaction. The other thing is that in the New York Metro area, in those Stop & Shops, we're expecting to see 900,000 visitors into those stores weekly. So our brand awareness, our access to other people's customers and ability to engage them is significantly enhanced with the Stop & Shop relationship.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jumped on a little late, sorry, I apologize if you guys covered this. But just on the efficiency ratio, it sounds like you guys pushed out the 55% target towards the back half of '13. I was just wondering, what -- any thoughts on what that does for the 125 ROA target?","Kirk W. Walters","In our commentary, we have not moved the 125 target moving out the efficiency ratio a little bit in '13, it's just a reflection of the Citizen's acquisition.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So what happens between late '13 and '14 to get the ROA lift up to 125?","Kirk W. Walters","It's a combination. As we said and the 125, we've advertised is hitting that number in '14, not for the year of '14, which I think we've been pretty clear on that. And I think that it's very consistent with what we outlined in the first quarter. It's continuing to grow loans and deposits. It's continuing to work the margin as best we can, certainly, the continuation of the good strong credit quality we have and reducing related foreclosure, different expenses and such to flow through in relation to that, and overall, continuing to crank our overall level of expenses down. So -- and the other component is certainly continuing to have good growth in our fee income products. So it's -- basically, if you take the goals that we outlined in the first quarter and the ranges that we gave them and work it through, that's the primary drivers of getting us to that number in '14.","Casey Haire - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, just lastly on M&A, can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the market in terms of sellers' willingness to come to the table and your appetite on that front?","Kirk W. Walters","I think in terms of the M&A environment, it remains very quiet. And overall, from our standpoint, we remain very focused on the task at hand in terms of growing loans and deposits and expect to be opportunistic if situations do arise.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Goulding for closing remarks.","Peter Goulding","Thank you again for joining us today.

My name is Sandra, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Andrew Hersom, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for People's United Financial Inc. Please proceed, sir.","Andrew Hersom","Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Here with me to review our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results are: Jack Barnes, President and Chief Executive Officer; David Rosato, Chief Financial Officer; Kirk Walters, Corporate Development and Strategic Planning; Jeff Tengel, Commercial Banking and Jeff Hoyt, Chief Accounting Officer. Please remember to refer to our forward-looking statements on slide 1 of this presentation, which is posted on our website, peoples.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jack.","Jack Barnes","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon. Appreciate everyone joining us today. Let\u2019s begin by turning to the full year overview on slide 2. 2017 was a noteworthy year for the company. We reported operating earnings of $346 million or $1.04 per common share, the highest in the bank's 175-year history. In April, we successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of Suffolk Bancorp, which further strengthened our presence in the New York metro area. In August, we also successfully closed and integrated the acquisition of LEAF Commercial Capital, which diversified our national equipment finance portfolio into the small ticket leasing segment.","We celebrated our franchise\u2019s 175th anniversary with a variety of volunteer and charitable activities, highlighted by $175,000 donation to Junior Achievement, our Community Foundation\u2019s single largest one-time grant ever. And we were once again recognized for our exceptional service by Greenwich Associates, who awarded People\u2019s United with eight awards, including a national best brand award in middle market banking for ease of doing business. We were very pleased with our strong financial performance for the year.","Results benefited from a $138 million increase in revenues versus the prior year to $1.5 billion, driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth. These increases, excuse me, this increase was due to improvements in both net interest income and non-interest income. In addition, results were highlighted by an 18 basis point improvement in net interest margin to 2.98%, the strongest level in three years and the first year-over-year increase since 2011. During the year, we continued to make revenue producing investments across our franchise.","Such investments include further building out commercial lending capabilities in the health care vertical and FDA lending as well as strengthening fee income generating infrastructure by improving our loan syndications capabilities and international services. We also implemented a leading edge customer relationship management system, which has begun to enhance the company's sales processes and increased referral and prospecting activity. We also continued to thoughtfully manage expenses.","From an operating perspective, expenses of $930 million were up $66 million from a year ago and were at the low end of our mid-year guidance. We are pleased with these results, given the inclusion of Suffolk and LEAF into the franchise during the year and having Gerstein Fisher on the books for a full 12 months. Loans ended the year at $32.6 billion, up $2.8 billion or 10% from 2016, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth. This increase was driven both by recent acquisitions and organic growth.","Excluding Suffolk and LEAF balances, loans grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by solid production in residential mortgages, equipment financing as well as middle market commercial and industrial lending, highlighting the importance and impact of our diversified business mix. Commercial real estate balances were unfavorably impacted by slower market conditions, higher payoff activity, a competitive environment and continued run-off of the transactional portion of our New York multi-family portfolio. From our perspective, some of our privately held owner operator clients have tended to be net sellers in this environment.","Period end deposits of $33.1 billion were up 3.2 billion or 11% from the prior year, driven by continued success, gathering organic deposits as well as the addition of Suffolk\u2019s attractive deposit base. As a result, non-interest bearing deposits now comprised 24% of total deposits, up from 22% a year ago. Finally, wealth management discretionary assets under management reached $9 billion, after achieving 14% growth during the year, due primarily to the new client inflows and strong market performance.","Moving to slide 3, we have included a scorecard of our 2017 goals, which were updated mid-year compared to actual results. We were in line with all of our goals with the exception of loan and deposit growth. As we guided on our October call, attaining the full year loan growth goal would be challenging in light of the market conditions I previously described within the commercial real estate, our largest portfolio. These market conditions continued during the fourth quarter and unfavorably impacted growth.","Before discussing the year ahead, I want to take a moment to reflect on the progress that we have made, improving operating leverage and enhancing profitability in recent years. Slides 4 through 6 illustrate this progress over the last five years, as evidenced by an improvement of 350 basis points in the efficiency ratio to 57.7%, 44% growth in earnings per common share to $1.04 and the 360 basis point increase in the return on average tangible common equity over this period. As we continue to build earnings power of the company, we remain focused on further improving these metrics.","Moving forward, we are excited by the opportunities in front of us to further strengthen and grow the company. In the year ahead, we will continue to enhance technology and marketing capabilities to better serve existing relationships and develop new ones. We will also provide new and refreshed products as well as align technology based offerings with our expert bankers to drive a unique client experience. We are confident revenue producing investments along with synergies created by the recent acquisitions will result in continued improvement in operating leverage and further create value for shareholders.","In addition, we remain very hopeful that the Industry Regulatory Reform will occur this year. Based on my involvement in the midsized bank coalition and the meetings I've attended on the issue, the $50 billion SIFI designation, it is front and center with many legislators in Washington and there is a bipartisan effort to pass the reform. We will continue to move toward our readiness to cross this threshold if legislation is not enacted and remain confident in our ongoing preparation.","With that background in mind, let me outline our goals for the full year 2018 as listed on slide 7. The first goal is to grow our loan portfolio in the range of 4% to 6% on both a period end and average balance basis. Secondly, our continued focus on gathering deposits is expected to drive deposit growth in the 3% to 5% range on both a period end and average balance basis. The next goal is for our net interest income to increase in the range of 10% to 12%. Embedded in this goal is the expectation of net interest margin to be in the range of 3.05% to 3.15%.","This net interest margin range is derived from many different factors, one of which is an assumption of 25 basis point rate increases in fed funds during the year. In addition, the net interest margin range includes the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond and IRB portfolios of approximately 5 basis points. We expect non-interest income on the operating basis to grow in the range of 3% to 5%. Operating non-interest expenses for the year are anticipated to be in the range of 975 million to 995 million as compared to 930 million in 2017.","This includes full year impact of the two acquisitions completed in 2017. We expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of $35 million to $45 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of 21% to 23%. Finally, we also plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at year end, holding company common equity tier 1 capital ratio will be in the range of 9.5% to 10%.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it to David to discuss the fourth quarter in more detail.","David Rosato","Thank you, Jack. We closed out 2017 with another quarter of strong financial results. Record quarterly operating earnings of $104.5 million increased 17% on a linked quarter basis and generated an operating return on average tangible equity of 14.1%. On a common per share basis, operating earnings were $0.31, up $0.05 from the third quarter. These results benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, higher fee income and well controlled expenses.","The quarter was also favorably impacted by a lower effective tax rate. It is important to note the quarter included the following items, which were deemed non-operating, given their non-reoccurring nature, security losses of $10 million pretax or 7.2 million after tax incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to recently enacted tax reform; a tax benefit of $6.5 million, resulting from a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and finally, merger related expenses of 1.6 million pretax or 1.1 million aftertax.","Turning to slide 9, net interest income of $292.3 million increased 3% on a linked quarter basis. The loan portfolio contributed 7.1 million to the increase in net interest income due to higher yields on new business, repricing of floating rate loans and higher average balances linked quarter. Net interest income also benefited $4.3 million from higher yields and average balances in the securities portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit costs and volumes.","Results in the fourth quarter benefited from further improvement in net interest margin, which increased 3 basis points linked quarter to 3.07%. This expansion as displayed on slide 10, was driven by the loan portfolio, which favorably impacted the margin by 6 basis points as new business yields remained higher than the total portfolio yield. A higher securities portfolio yield also increased the margin by 1 basis point, while higher deposit costs had an unfavorable impact of 4 basis points.","Linked quarter loan growth continued to highlight the impact and importance of our diversified business mix, as shown on slide 11. Period end loans increased 2% annualized, driven by strong results across each of our equipment financing units and solid production in middle market commercial and industrial lending. This growth was partially offset by lower commercial real estate balances due to the reasons Jack outlined earlier in his remarks. Mortgage warehouse lending balances ended the quarter at 1.045 billion, a decrease of only $22 million from September 30. However, average balances for this business were down $107 million in the quarter. As such, while the total loan portfolio increased 4% annualized on an average balance basis, growth, excluding mortgage warehouse, was 5% annualized.","Turning to slide 12, period end deposits of 33.1 billion were up 509 million or 6% annualized for the quarter. The largest driver of this increase was higher non-interest bearing balances of 347 million, primarily driven by our retail and municipal businesses. Deposits also benefited from a $218 million increase in time balances due in part to a successful two year 1.75% CD offering, celebrating the company's 175th anniversary. On an average balance basis, total deposits increased 10% annualized.","Fourth quarter noninterest income totaled 87.3 million. During the quarter, we sold approximately 290 million of four year duration securities, yielding 1.28% to take advantage of 2017\u2019s higher marginal tax rate. 150 million of sales proceeds have been reinvested in two year duration securities, yielding approximately 190 and in the first quarter, we intend to further add securities to fully replace loss carry income. As I referenced earlier, the 10 million pretax or 7.2 million aftertax loss, as a result of these sales, was deemed non-operating and was offset by $6.5 million tax benefit associated with tax reform.","On an operating basis, as displayed on slide 13, non-interest income of 97.3 million increased 8% or -- $8 million or 9% from the third quarter. Higher noninterest income was primarily driven by a $3.3 million improvement in customer interest rate swap income as well as a $1.8 million increase in commercial banking lending fees, largely due to higher commercial real estate prepayment income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher operating lease income and investment management fees. The largest offset to these improvements was a $2.8 million decline in insurance revenues, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals, which are higher in the first and third quarters of the year.","On slide 14, we display the components driving the increase in noninterest expenses on a linked quarter basis. Included in this quarter's results were merger related expenses of 1.6 million, with 1 million in professional and outside services and 600,000 in compensation and benefits. As a reminder, third quarter merger related expenses were $3 million, of which 2.7 million were included in professional and outside services and the remainder split between occupancy and equipment as well as other. Excluding merger related costs, noninterest expenses were 238.1 million, an increase of $4 million or 2% from the third quarter.","The largest driver of these results was a $1.8 million increase in compensation and benefit, primarily reflecting higher incentives and healthcare costs. Expenses were also unfavorably impacted by a $1.6 million increase in regulatory assessments, resulting from higher average assets as well as a $1.2 million increase in professional and outside services. As a reminder, payroll taxes, 401(k) matches and winter related operational costs are highest in the first quarter of the year. Accordingly, based on historical experience, these expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","As Jack mentioned earlier, we continued to enhance our operating leverage as evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the efficiency ratio. As displayed on slide 15, the efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.1%, which marks an improvement of 120 basis points on a linked quarter basis and 320 basis points from a year ago. Going forward, even with the significant progress we have made, we will continue to emphasize improving our operating leverage through revenue growth and effective expense management.","Our strong credit culture and conservative underwriting standards continue to drive exceptional asset quality as demonstrated on slide 16. Originated non-performing assets, as a percentage of originated loans and REO, at 56 basis points is once again well below our peer group and top 50 banks. Net charge-offs of 8 basis point remain at a very low level and continue to reflect the minimal loss content in our non-performing assets.","As displayed on slide 17, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity were 96 basis points and 13.8% respectively. Both metrics increased for the second consecutive quarter and were significantly higher than a year ago. We are pleased with the progress we have made improving these metrics over recent periods and remain focused on executing on our strategy to further enhance returns.","Continuing on to slide 18, capital ratios at the holding company ended the year either improved or unchanged from September 30th. Capital levels remain strong, especially in light of our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management.","The final slide on page 19 displays our interest rate risk profile for both parallel rate changes and yield curve twists. We remain asset sensitive, but slightly less so than at September 30. However, we remain well positioned for further increases in interest rates as approximately 44% of our loan portfolio at quarter end was either one month LIBOR or prime based, consistent with both the previous quarter and a year ago.","Now, we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have. Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","What is the right tax rate? I know, this is kind of a moot point, right, because we know what it is for 2018, but for this quarter alone, if I back out the tax adjustments that you guys have on, it looks like page 18 of your press release, I still come up with sort of a very unusually low tax rate this quarter. Is there something else in there or something that we're not seeing? Thanks.","David Rosato","Ken, it\u2019s David. The -- we had -- the IRS allowed the filing of 2016 taxes to be delayed one month. So rather than filing them by September 30th, we had until October 31. Normally, in the third quarter, we true up our tax line. And then that true up is spread over the back half of the year. This year, it was all in the fourth quarter. So we -- it\u2019s a growing portfolio of low income housing tax credits that we've been growing over the last couple of years and just as that portfolio seasons, we continue to get more tax credit off of that portfolio and that was the driver in the quarter.","Ken Zerbe","So that item -- the true up I guess in theory shouldn't -- there should be no corresponding impact next year, it's just [indiscernible] your new lower tax rate? Okay. I think I got that. And then just in terms of your guidance that you've provided for next year, the base number that we're talking about, like the growth in fees or the growth in expenses, is that off of reported, because I\u2019m thinking of like that $10 million of security loss this quarter, is it based on reported numbers or is it based on sort of operating items?","David Rosato","It\u2019s operating for both fee income as well as expenses. And so Ken, just to go back for a sec, so the guidance that we provided around the effective tax rate of 21% to 23%, there is a lot implicit in that that runs through the tax line as you know, but we will plan to continue growing that portfolio. So it is -- as it's grown over years, that true-up impact has grown, but we would expect it to be generally consistent with what happened this year. So, it is embedded in the guidance.","Ken Zerbe","And sorry, just to be clear though, the way you explained it, it sounds like the true-up is sort of always a positive item, is it ever a negative?","David Rosato","No. From that piece, it will always be a positive.","Ken Zerbe","Got you. Okay. So as long as we build in that positive true-up in the back half of next year, that gets us to the 21% to 23% on a non or GAAP basis?","David Rosato","Yes. Our expectations around that line item are for the full year are in the guidance we provided.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JP Morgan.","Steven Alexopoulos","Wanted to start on expenses, if I annualize the fourth quarter, which included the prior acquisitions, the upper end of this 975 to 995 range you\u2019re guiding to for 2018 seems on the high side, particularly, given all of the focus on the efficiency ratio. Is this tied to you guys planning to spend some of the benefit from lower taxes or is something else driving this?","David Rosato","Steve, it\u2019s David. So, if you use the middle of the guidance of $55 million off of the 930 base, you come up with 6% expense growth. But if you back out the full year impacts of both LEAF and Suffolk, that number is about 4% expense growth. That's consistent with expense growth that we experienced this year. So, in our comments, you saw very positive operating leverage this year. And you should expect to see that going forward. So we are continuing to make expenses -- investments. Jack referenced some of those, we've talked about them on past calls as well. But you have seen the revenues coming off of that, those investments that we\u2019ve made and further leading to the operating leverage we've experienced.","Jack Barnes","And Steve, it\u2019s Jack. Just remember as well, not to annualize the fourth quarter because the first quarter is always higher, right, with the comps impact primarily.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. I just wanted to ask on the loan side, just two questions there. On the New York City multi-family portfolio, which I know remains a bit of a drag, what's the size of that portfolio and how should we think about that headwind in 2018?","David Rosato","Sure. That portfolio \u2013","Jack Barnes","1.4 billion at the end of this -- of the year.","David Rosato","And well that portfolio probably will come off next year about $250 million to $300 million over the course of the year.","Steven Alexopoulos","That's helpful. And then just one more, on the equipment finance, you guys had 200 million of growth this quarter, which included the full quarter with LEAF, how do you think about that 200 million? Is that a good quarterly growth rate? Thanks.","David Rosato","I\u2019ll take it. We were very pleased with the growth there. The level of activity at our largest equipment finance company, PCLC had \u2013 they had a very strong fourth quarter. We think a lot of that had to do with the tax reform and the acceleration for the 100% write off of LEAF expenses.","Jack Barnes","But, they always have a strong \u2013","David Rosato","And they always have a strong fourth quarter as well. And then, the only other comment is we had very nice performance out of LEAF as we expected.","Steven Alexopoulos","Okay. But it sounds like 200 million is maybe a bit optimistic in terms of a run rate?","David Rosato","Yes. As you grow -- as we look to last year, I would expect LEAF to grow in the neighborhood of about 25% to 30% and the other two historical companies to grow at about 5%.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.","Casey Haire","First of all, I just wanted to follow up on the operating fees, just the guidance. I have as a starting point in 2017 about 362.2, is that the correct base?","David Rosato","Yes.","Casey Haire","Okay. Great. And so the other income line in the fourth quarter looked, was really big, what was the driver there and what is a good run rate going forward.","David Rosato","I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question, Casey?","Casey Haire","So, the other income line within fees was very strong, was up 6 million or so. So, what was the driver there and what's a good run rate going forward? I'm assuming it comes back down?","David Rosato","Yeah. There were a couple of one-timers in there, Casey. The two largest would be, we had $2.6 million gain on the sale of two acquired loans. One goes back to the Smithtown acquisition and one goes back to Danvers. We also sold the headquarters building from Suffolk out on Riverhead and Long Island. That produced a gain of about 1.3 million. So, you should back that out. Other than that, it was just a few pushes and pulls on that line item.","Casey Haire","And then just switching to loans, obviously, CRE has got some headwinds still. So, what are the -- what's going to pick up that slack to get you to that loan growth guidance? Is it, I mean, Reg E mortgage has been a good story for you. Is that going to continue or is there, what's sort of the drivers to pick up the slack on the CRE side?","Jack Barnes","Casey, this is Jack. So, we would say resi mortgage will slow. That has slowed, the pipelines are slower. So we won't get as much out of there next year, but we are expecting good solid growth across our commercial middle market and small business lending. We have good expectations around the ABL, not so much warehouse lending, again given the changes in the market. And then in the equipment finance areas, we expect that case that David reference the LEAF to continue and the other two units to do in that range that he mentioned. So you\u2019ve got the combination of the commercial lines and the different businesses, we expect to make good solid progress and make up the difference for some of that slow weak demand that we see in CRE at least right now. And so, that's what we're putting in the plan. We're not expecting that to turn around in a very fast way.","David Rosato","The only thing I would add to that is probably 5% to 6% growth across our business banking portfolios. And then as Jack referenced in his comments, the investments that we're making in our healthcare vertical will flow through the C&I line.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo.","Jared Shaw","Can you talk a little bit about what you think you could do with this tax dividend, with the new tax law change? If I look at your capital levels, you\u2019re already outside the range on common equity tier 1. Should we expect to see maybe a higher cash dividend or buybacks or I guess how are you thinking about deploying the extra earnings coming from the tax benefit?","David Rosato","Yeah. Sorry, so, it was a little hard to hear you, Jared. So you\u2019re expecting what we expect to do with the benefits of the tax reform?","Jared Shaw","Right. Yeah. So, I mean, as your capital levels are already strong, should we expect to see a more robust capital management program or would you be looking to do more acquisitions or I guess where should we expect to see some of that benefit long term?","David Rosato","Yeah. So, I would say, as we see the impact of the improvement in probability fall to the bottom line, we do expect to generate more capital and we\u2019ll basically go through our capital management process. As you know, we already have a pretty healthy dividend payout now. So we're looking forward to that coming down and more in line with kind of our target there. And right now, that\u2019s our perspective on it and we\u2019ll look to kind of run into our existing capital management program as we move forward.","Jack Barnes","Yeah. The only other color I would add to that Jared is, as you followed us for a long time, you know that we've been working down our dividend payout ratio and then on the regulatory front, you're starting to see cash dividends of the larger banks increase and we're expecting going forward, higher capital return from those banks. So as we think out beyond next year, but farther out, as other bank\u2019s capital levels start to come down towards ours, we think we will have an opportunity on a longer term planning horizon to be able to start buying back stock at some point.","Jared Shaw","And then on the expense side, so looking at the expenses in conjunction with the -- your commentary Jack around the SIFI threshold, does that expense guidance assume that SIFI \u2013 the SIFI threshold is raised and what is -- what about the timing of that in your mind? And if we don't see it happen at some point, when do you actually have to start maybe spending the money to implement the current SIFI threshold?","Jack Barnes","So the guidance includes all of the efforts that we've been talking about in prior calls and meaning much of the impact in the run rate, being SIFI ready is already there. There's really nothing unusual in the guidance for next year as it relates to SIFI, because it isn't necessary. And, we're hopeful as I said in the comments that we can get something done here. I think the nature of the bill and the bipartisan support is obviously a huge change in how things have evolved in recent years.","So I'm really hopeful about that. So that said, as I finish that comment, I\u2019m really just trying to make sure everybody want to know that we understand that we need to manage through the various challenges, including SIFI preparation and we've been doing that and building out all of the areas around financial standards and data governance, et cetera and feel very good about where we are in terms of that preparedness.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dave Rochester with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Rochester","Back on the expense guide, just to clarify. It sounds like you're saying the lifting of the SIFI threshold shouldn't impact your expectations on expense growth this year. Is that fair?","Jack Barnes","Yeah. It is. Much of that investment is in things that we have been doing through the B50B project, really for now, multiple years. So if it's strengthening data governance, if it\u2019s strengthening our enterprise risk framework, the resources and the skillset and the strength of those programs is in place. And so, those expenses are part of our run rate now and there would be some unusual things that would come in gradually, but we're not expecting anything unusual when and if we get there.","Dave Rochester","Okay. Great. And I appreciate the color. And on the NIM guide, what's the timing of the rate hikes that you're talking about and how much lift do you guys assume you get with each hike?","David Rosato","Well, we have -- as we've said, we have two built in. Right now, we're working under the assumption that June and November, that's underlying the guidance. We're also slightly flatter yield curve over the course of the year. From a \u2013 I will answer it slightly differently. From a quarter to quarter perspective, as next year unfolds, we\u2019d expect flat fourth quarter to first quarter just because of day count. We\u2019ve also alluded in our guidance about the impact of tax reform on the NIM, but beyond that, I would expect a three to five basis point basically linear increase as the year -- as 2018 unfolds.","Dave Rochester","And then you said, I'm sorry, the first rate hike is June hike. Is that right?","David Rosato","Yeah. That's what we were assuming. So obviously as that comes forward, we would benefit from that.","Dave Rochester","That makes sense. And then just on deposits, are you guys seeing any increase in pricing pressure at all post the hike or is it pretty much what you saw in the fourth quarter and then where are you seeing competitor rates at this point?","David Rosato","I would say really nothing from the last hike, so nothing from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. As we've talked about, the pressure that we've experienced has been in our largest government banking clients and some of our very large commercial clients. But as you get into smaller commercial, smaller government entities and retail, we really haven't seen some things or across the board deposit pressures. So, deposits were up 4 basis points linked quarter to 47 basis points. From our perspective, our deposit costs have been very well controlled, so we had a beta, a deposit beta of 16% in Q4, but if you look over the tightening cycle today, we\u2019re up 125 basis points in the Fed funds rate and we're up 14 basis points on deposit costs. So my calculator says that's 11% deposit beta, which we would -- we do believe as rates go higher and Fed tightening has become more sustained, the beta will increase, but to date, cycle to date, it's been very well contained.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Breese with Piper Jaffray.","Matthew Breese","I was hoping for just a little bit more color on the underlying issues with of course real estate and then New York City multi-family portfolio and I know you noted competition, but maybe you could just give us an idea of the extent of that in terms of spread compression in new rates? And then as a follow up, is the runoff in that portfolio enough to keep the CRE portfolio flat to down in 2018. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?","Jack Barnes","I am going to give you a little bit of -- there isn't a lot more color than what we've gave you in the guidance in terms of what's going on in the market. I mean, as we have said, we see -- I think there is -- especially with the privately held owner operator, people are being cautious and feeling like properties are fully valued and so they are net sellers right now. That\u2019s where some of the payoffs that we mentioned comes with the slowness in the markets. There aren\u2019t as many buyers when things are fully valued. That\u2019s our perspective on. The New York multi-family is a separate issue, right. We now -- many years ago, we decided that the spreads were getting too tight.","My understanding is they're still very tight, sorry, tighter. So we decided that there just wasn't enough spread in the business for us to keep producing and stay kind of in the game and so we pulled back and we\u2019ve been there a couple of years anyway now and so we basically, we service those loans naturally and we respond to people as they have any questions or issues, but we are primarily -- we don't have an origination unit that is out there competing for that business. So that\u2019s where we are on that and we think very modest growth in the portfolio next year, but not declining.","David Rosato","Yeah. I would echo those comments, you will see growth in our commercial real estate portfolio, exclusive with multi-family of about 3%, but that will be mostly offset by the decline in the multi-family portfolio.","Matthew Breese","And then one of the added benefits or we talked about added benefits from tax would be enhanced loan growth or potential for enhanced loan growth. Are you seeing any evidence for that? And if so, whereabouts.","Jack Barnes","We are not seeing evidence of that yet. I would say that what the tax reform does is it bring clarity to the situation, right. Those that we\u2019re waiting to see if they would make an investment with a different tax code structure are now on the other side of that. And, we do think it has very good potential to spur growth in the economy, spur further investment and equipment. And the thing that we're watching most closely is if the economy begins to improve, then the companies are going to start to increase sales and build inventories and our line utilization should move in an upward direction and it is not done yet to this point.","Matthew Breese","My last question, could you talk about the healthcare portfolio, how big it is and the areas you're focused on.","Jack Barnes","Yeah. Off the top of my head, I am going to tell you how big it is. We've had healthcare relationships over time, long time across our footprint. So, what we have done is strengthened our ability to grow that business by strengthening the skillsets and the resources that we're focusing on. And we are bringing that unit together to focus on it. So we brought in some folks and a leader who has years of focusing in that healthcare vertical and what we're going to do is leverage off of that to continue, particularly in our footprint, healthcare is a big part of our economies across the northeast and we want to do more in all of those areas, so not just hospitals, but long term care homes, facilities, and other types of healthcare activities that service off and around all the healthcare needs of people.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Collyn Gilbert with KBW.","Collyn Gilbert","Two quick housekeeping items. First is just a question on the fees. When Casey, I think referenced a fee income number of, I think, you said like 362 or something that we should use as a baseline to then assume your targets of 3% to 5% and you guys said, yeah, that was right, but I'm just trying to reconcile that with -- if we looked at just in the press release, you had roughly 353 million of fee income for the full 2017, addback the 25 million of security losses, it's closer to 377 number. So I didn't know what else I was missing to drop it to that 362?","David Rosato","Yeah. So, thanks for asking the question. So, we're working -- we're only adding 10 million back for the Q4 security losses. Yeah. The other security losses that we took earlier in the year, there were gains and losses on the same line item. So, the base is closer to 363.","Collyn Gilbert","Got it. All right. Thank you for that. And then one other just quick question, the CD campaign that you guys are running in sort of celebration of your 175th year, is that campaign finished now or are you still running that into the beginning of this quarter?","David Rosato","We're still running it now. We're talking about whether we should continue it discontinue it or adjust pricing.","Collyn Gilbert","And then just, if you guys could just give us an update on how business has been out on Long Island. I know that the pipelines I think were pretty good with Suffolk in the third quarter. How you\u2019re seeing the pipelines and then also if you're seeing any fallout or impact of the Astoria-Sterling merger having closed just this past quarter.","Jack Barnes","Yeah. So, things are going very well on New York and Long Island. I think, if you look to the details in the back where we've started to break out our loans, deposits by state, so that people get a little bit more visibility about that, you will see a growing portfolio on the loan side with -- in Long Island and in New York. It really is coming from a variety of places, the -- so our original group if you will, what is now the combined middle market group is making good steady progress, not at a strong, strong rate, but good steady progress. Suffolk, and their relationship managers really strengthened in a very meaningful way our business banking efforts.","So we\u2019ve more than doubled the number of relationships with feet on the ground and everybody's been doing a good job. It\u2019s actually providing the company our biggest pipeline in that market segment. So, we're really pleased with that. We've mentioned in the past, our New York commercial real estate unit, which covers all of Manhattan and Long island is growing nicely. We\u2019ve had a lot of really nice activity. Some of it doesn't show yet, because it\u2019s construction related. So it\u2019s not drawn down yet. But it\u2019s a group of really talented people that are making great progress. So we're pleased overall with all of the business units in that New York market.","Collyn Gilbert","And then I guess finally, Jack, you had mentioned kind of in your opening remarks that you fully expect regulatory reform this year? How does that overlay into the likelihood that you all would be participating in some form of traditional M&A this year?","Jack Barnes","I would say if the SIFI level is moved from 50 to 250 as is proposed, it does certainly make the path to activity easier. On the margin, as we've said, if it was the right deal, we would proceed anyway and we feel like those preparations have \u2013 would put us in that position. But that said, obviously, if that's not in the way, it makes it easier.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Erik Zwick with Stephens Inc.","Erik Zwick","Loan to deposit ratio ended 2017 at 98.5%.","Andrew Hersom","Eric, could you speak a little closer to the phone or wherever. We can\u2019t hear you.","Erik Zwick","Your loan to deposit ratio ended 2017 at 98.5% and if I apply the midpoint of your loan and deposit growth goals for 2018, you would end 2018 just under 100%, maybe 99.5%. What is the high end of your comfort range for this ratio?","David Rosato","I would start with what is our goal. Our goal is really to run just around 100 or lower loan to deposit ratio. If you go back in time three to four years ago, it crept up briefly to upto 105 to 106. We were uncomfortable there and started increasing our deposit gathering efforts. We wouldn't expect it to get back there, kind of what we would call in the new environment, because those ongoing deposit efforts have now become ingrained into the company. As you can see with the success we've had over the last couple of years growing commercial deposit base and growing our government banking business. So at 12\/31\/18, I wouldn't expect any major difference in our loan to deposit ratio from where it is today.","Erik Zwick","Okay. And just kind of -- David given your commentary earlier that the deposit beta has been just 11 basis points this cycle and that you would expect it to increase maybe just gradually, but not a huge jump up. I was just kind of trying to understand maybe why you're targeting slightly slower deposit growth than loan growth in 2018 as opposed to trying to match it dollar for dollar at this point.","David Rosato","Well, they're both ranges theoretically if we hit the high end of deposit and the low end of loans, right, we\u2019re starting out with more deposits and loans, our loan to deposit ratio would fall. So, I would just say based on past experience, it is easier to grow the loan book and the deposit book. And hence the way the guidance would -- one of the reasons the way the guidance was presented, but what I would say is, there is a lot of deposit gathering power in our franchise, especially on the retail side, if and when we choose to blanket the market with advertisement and put an attractive rate out there. And that gives us confidence to know that we can bring in those deposits when we want to or when we need them.","Erik Zwick","All right. And just one last question from me, do you think the tax reform will have a material impact on residential real estate values in some of your higher priced markets and what could that potentially mean for mortgage and home equity volumes going forward?","Jack Barnes","So, this is Jack. So, we've been talking about that like a lot of people I guess. And I would start by saying that in that higher price type of property, we do expect that there would be at least some additional softness as a result of the tax reform, really hard to gauge what kind of an impact that is. You've got someone that\u2019s in a home like that has capacity and how that'll change their view about the desirability of an attractive property is hard to gauge right now. I would just go to when we talk about it in terms of what we're expecting in our portfolio and we think about that potential weakness, we've been originating loans with a very conservative loan to values and very strong credit scores for a long, long time. The portfolios are very seasoned. So we don't have concerns about any impact broadly for sure.","If there was something, it would be very, very much on the margin, so to speak. So, have the same concern, not sure, I would say the same on home equity volume. The beauty of the home equity product is its flexibility, right. You want to go buy a car, you want to pay a tuition bill, you write a check, you don't have to go apply for the next loan, so the structure of home equity to the consumer I think is going to remain very attractive. And I would be very surprised if that changes. Again, does the lack of the adaptability of the interest changed the flow or growth of the portfolio? We\u2019re looking to see how that's all going to play out.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, since there are no further questions in the queue, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Barnes for closing remarks.","Jack Barnes","Thank you. In closing, record quarterly income for the fourth quarter provided a great finish to the strong 2017 for People\u2019s United. We were pleased with our performance during the quarter, which was highlighted by continued progress, enhancing our profitability metrics, further expansion in net interest margin, ongoing improvement in operating leverage, the importance of our diversified business mix, strong deposit growth, particularly non-interest bearing deposits, exceptional asset quality. Looking ahead, we are well positioned to execute on the opportunities in front of us and are committed to provide superior service to clients and we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to shareholders. Thank you for your interest in People\u2019s United. Have a good night.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day, everyone."]}}
